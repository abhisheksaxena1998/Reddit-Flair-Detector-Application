Food,Migrant worker breaks down while being offered food. Source in comments.,6219,fqh8zl,https://v.redd.it/zsbcsrzqzdp41,421,,anonymouse_2001," Who are the nice people offering the food? Is it an NGO? One woman seems uniformed. Are they from the government? UP Delhi border from last two days is uncontrollable. UP and Delhi gov have arranged busses to ferry the workers but all of them are more crowded than any normal day, people are climbing on roof of the buses, thousands pf men women children are on the streets. Crowd management is total failure there The rich brought the virus to our soil, and the poor are the ones that suffer.
While people I know are trying to figure out where they’d get their next packet of cigarettes from, migrant workers are on the streets breaking down on the sight of food to eat, and a clean bottle of water.
I feel so helpless that I can’t physically do more than just rant on the Internet. I hate this feeling. [deleted] Fuck. I wasn't ready for this.

Can't imagine the trauma 1000s are going through away fron their families with no food or shelter.

Really puts things in perspective when you see such things.

How can the government choose to ignore this. Empathy nahi hai saalo mein.

Hindu Muslim Right Left doesn't matter. Humanity should come first. Those aren’t tears of gratitude. Please don’t mistake them for that. Sure, there is some gratitude behind them, but know this: behind every tear the poor shed, there is restrained anger, hidden shame, wounded pride. Every one of those tears is telling them that this is no way of living, only to have to live like that for many, many days to come. Someone will come who will weaponize those emotions and no tyrant will be able to stand against them. For now, all we can do is hope that such a day will come.’ I'm kinda torn about this. On the one hand I see the importance of letting the country know how bad the situation has become. On the other, I think taking a  video of this man crying steals the few shreds of dignity he has left. Yaar koi reliable ngo/organisation doing something about this? How can we help?! Source - https://twitter.com/aaqibrk/status/1243594510480707585?s=19 And here I am sitting at my home complaining over small things, seeing this video made me think how undeserving I am, this man probably busts his ass all day providing for his family and that's a normal day.... I can even begin to imagine what so many people are going through, it's as if we are all on a ship and they have been left in the cold dark sea, just with a floater.... I pray they get through this. And the people helping them are absolute heroes. Wish they reach home soon.. We have failed as a society. Imagine being recorded while you shed tears of pain Man this really puts things into perspective. How life can be difficult, unforgiving. At one moment you leave for a city far away with dreams, ambition and hope. And at another all of that is taken from you.  More people are going to suffer due to the unemployed caused by coronavirus than coronavirus itself. This is sad. Very sad. I lost my sadism and sarcasm looking at this i am serious. I never feel so helpless upon seeing these people. No one deserve to face such. 
I couldn't control my tears. Still thinking why. Corona virus has revealed real, terrible holes in our system. We have an economy that heavily relies on efforts of exactly those who used up and chewed out and treated like dirt.

If we learn anything from this crises, let it be the fact that our neoliberal, capitalist society has time and time again failed vast majority of its participants because of lack of humanity of the process. We need to wake up or this becomes a new normal. Good to see people are coming forward. While it wont do a lot, it is a good place to start. The most shocking part is that some people are blaming these poor folks for the situation. They also applaud each time they see police brutality in the name of this lockdown. Empathy is pretty much dead I think in India. Ok, i get it... it is emotional... but don't zoom in when someone is breaking down..give them some privacy In spite of being a huge critic of Modi, I appreciated the decision of lockdown he took. But at that point of time, I didn't consider the situation of these workers. Of course, he has a team of specialists so they must have known what is gonna happen regarding this. So I don't understand why they couldn't give any time for these workers to reach their villages beforehand by announcing the lockdown a couple of days ahead. All our money is of no use if we can't do anything for humanity. on top of that we are fed hindu muslim pakistan everyday. UP government has recently allotted 1,000 buses to bring people back home. I wish I can make a difference in the world when I grow up 💔 To all my fellow Indians, at a time like this, those of us who have the luxury to stay home and have the means to help others should take care of the less fortunate. We cannot just blame the government and expect them to take care of each an every individual. It is important we the regular people do our part. You can find some NGO to donate to, I hope some here can provide a link of a reliable one but it is better if you find a local initiative in your community. If you dont have one then start one, but it is important if each person contributes to their local community Jo bhi ho, from Demonetisation to Lockdown, it is the lower class people who has to suffer. Oh dear...i teared up a bit there. I cant imagine who to thank the relative comfort i have in life. That lad will do something for himself. The circumstances that have led him and countless others to this situation are so out of their control that tears seem appropriate. I wish him well. Isn't there anything us commoners can do for them from our homes??? Rula diya vencho T_T Why the fuck are they being filmed like that ? A man's having a weak moment. Give them their fucking space. Gosh. Seems more like a gimmick. Sad to see this... I assume this situation is coz of landlords who asked these people to vacate houses as in these times they cannot pay rent. 

From what I know the first migrant worker sets up a base in the city and establishes himself... takes more work and calls more people from his village convincing their families that he'll earn a good amount. They stay in groups of 6-8 or more.

Here's the states responsibility of not creating enough jobs is the prime reason. We also should have a threshold limit of population control for each city.  Jo ye bichare jis pareshani se jhuujh rahe hai wo kisi bhi pandemic se badi hai Income inequality aur poverty itni badi emergency ko hum sabne kabhi ek problem k taur per nhi dekha. Aaj Covid19 ne jo life k matrix mein glitch daal k hum sabki aankhein kholi hai usse shayad humari Insaniyat wapas aa Jaye. 


I know many chutiyas in my family who will blame everything on Illuminati and then entire day they will bitch and be toxic to every person they meet but somehow praying to God makes them a better person . These deluded imbeciles are the main reasons why politicians win elections kyonki simple minded ko apeel karne k liye bhashan kaafi hai aur aise deluded log kabhi khud ko nhi Question karte. /u/vredditdownloader I'm out of words. This breaks my heart, i hope they reach home safe and sound . This is honestly so fucking sad I am feeling sad for them Damn its tough to watch a grown man breaking apart like that. It's always the poor who suffer the most during time like these. I have nothing but to thank those beautiful souls providing food. Fuck. This broke my heart This made me cry. I beg the government to atleast provide them shelters or transport to reach their homes. The poor always suffers in this nation. Guys please donate to PM CARES fund. what are some legit charities / foundations we can donate to and ensure that our money is well spent These people are the ones building our homes, roads, bridges and the country. It fucking breaks my heart seeing them like this that they are facing hardships getting even a plate of food. Guys, Do you know any NGOs that I can donate to? A trusted NGO? It's so easy to forget about this part of our country while sitting in a well furnished room with all basic amenities. (Myself included). Whoever helps during these times, I wish them every happiness and comfort in their lives. I wish I was earning to contribute in some way. It's ironic but I will say it anyway - ""Together we stand"". The tears from him explain how important food is.  I hope the donors provide free food daily until they have their regular wages. Is there anything Modi does with proper planning? I couldn’t help but break down looking at this. How can I send money to help them ? This gave me chills. Anyone who is privileged enough to be on reddit from the comfort of their homes should be very very grateful. But we all know we will never be. So my tax money goes to netas ghar, 10-20Rs ki chicken in government premises, traveling abroad, buying private jets... This post is not written by drawn into emotions. All of this migration could have been avoided if Modi would have worked with state governments to feed everyone who is out of regular wages (like community kitchen opened across Kerala during this pandemic). Instead he did the usual drama, probably not even consulting his ministers. This migration is going to be the equivalent of army personnels spreading spanish flu to the nooks and corners of Europe. I appreciate the effort and concern but just imagine going into the face of man with a camera/phone and recording him breaking down in tears thats not good. Its partially gratitude and partially embarrassment. 

One of the hardest things for anybody in this world is to accept help. It's hard for a man to ask for help. A grown man who did all he could to make an honest living breaks down because of a pandemic. 

I feel so helpless and hopeless looking at this suffering but honestly the reality is I felt so good about myself just because of the sadness this makes me feel. 

It makes me feel better, 
than that someone, who doesn’t care. 

The complaining and the sorrow is essentially my coping mechanism for the tragedy that this is. 

I broke down slightly this morning, when I spoke to my father asking him to make sure the workers in our small shop are taken care of(because of this post). 
I made sure he didn’t notice my tears.

Namesake are those tears or even selfish at best. 

I wish there was someone that i could pin this on.

Other than the fact that this is a world that we live in and so we carry on.

Many of these people won’t make it. But I am sure I will.

At least I will make it out of this better than most. 
Thank the lottery that these brothers lost
And I won. While it is truly moving, I wish the person filming gave the man some dignity, and did not take the camera to his face.

These are tough times. Remember, United We Stand. I don't know how right I am , but I still think instead of  arrangements of Busses to travel back home UP govt. should have invested in Tents or supplies for our fellow migrants workers, for they shouldn't have to be forced to walk back home.

When asked in various news sources almost everyone said ""Paise Khatam ho gye hai, hum bhukey hai kai dino se, Corona se pehle to hum bhuuk se mar jayenge.""

(Translation: We are hungry and not eaten for many days and we have no money left and will die of hunger even before Corona gets us.)

Maybe, just maybe I think they made arrangements for busses because I don't for sure but i think we didn't have enough funds to feed this many people. So they decided to let every help them there houses instead.
But this might backfire as they are so desperate right now that they don't care for social distancing and all. Well its not there fault , as one in this times would be. But there's a risk of carrying the virus in great numbers to their respective villages. 

Damn. If China would have put a permanent Ban on some animal traded in there Wet Markets learning from SARS and also have not suppressed they Doc. who tried to Warn their Govt. about this virus.. Things would have been way different.. I dislike - immensely - the camera angle.

Hear me out: to be standing \*over\* the desperate, at a time when eating ( usually a rather 'private' activity in rural areas) and while these migrants are seated on a rough road...makes me even sadder.

Everything about this situation is despicable. 

Ok - the ""so what would you have done"" - I would have crouched down to a lower level, explained that I would like to take images in order to help get more food/relief for others via social media/MADia and only then taken images

My 2c I understand the intention of filming this, but it comes off as poverty porn. Esp the zoom on the crying. Social media has made charity moments so much worse than those donate videos on TV. To stop you from watching this, they did this:

 *“In a country where people are afraid of criticizing the government,  many things must be going horrible! In such countries people must know  that a society of cowards will always be remembered as a society of  honourless people!”* Seriously Guys., Learnt and  Educated North Indian Folks who have voted for BJP, take a minute and think what you have done in right or worng. The way Indian government is handling this is pathetic. You cannot close down the entire country without making sure that everyone gets food, water, and other essentials, regardless of whether they're rich or poor. The way things are set up now, only the privileged few can afford to self isolate. This will end pretty badly. 

I hope the government realises this soon and sets up rations delivery to every citizen. u/VredditDownloader Man this hurts Damn. never felt so helpless before ever. Not just about this, but everything going on. I'm about to graduate from a ""premium"" university with a ""highly sought after degree"". But I've never felt so helpless before. u/vRedditDownloader [deleted] u/vredditdownloader 😭😭😭😭 Where is this? u/__panda101__ This is absolutely heartbreaking.. These are really tough time, I hope more good people like these comes out to help.
This video really got me😢 Do you guys have any clue on how someone can help out during this crisis ? Other than practicing social distancing and staying at home ofcourse. 🙏🏼 This is going to haunt is forever.... This is sad. Government didn't thought this through Humanity will never ever forgive us for what we do to them repeatedly year after year. Why post the poor man's plight out in public? This is not a responsible post. Good work lads!!Pr yeh piche se chutiya kon hai pagal ho kya😂😂 There must be so many thoughts going in their mind - their job, money, how and when will they be able to reunite with their family and then food. These are uncertain and very tough times. I hope they all reach their homes safely and without getting infected. Praying for everyone. Is there some way we can help them? u/vredditdownloader /U/vredditdownloader Yes let’s film them What can we do to help? Actual effective initiatives? Assuming that I can donate my time and effort more than money(Kinda broke, lol). Opportunities to volunteer? Fuck what times are we living in. For fuck sake this needs to end. This is fucking heartbreaking! bc yese logo k le kuch karna h life mai If this lockdown/pandemic doesn't teach us to decentralise jobs and development throughout the country, and equitable distribution of livelihood, nothing ever will. We need to tackle this now, PERIOD PLEASE! How can we help? Does anyone know any genuine NGO that has taken on the task of helping the poor during the lock down? If someone knows any dependable organization that we can donate to? I'm not donating to any sarkari funds anymore so please don't suggest that. Whoever the f*ck do something wrong and whatever had happened in any country, the poor always suffers.
Flu came with rich but will go along with millions of poor lives and dreams😔😔😔. This is sad. Please stay strong. How can I help? So hungry. Thank goodness they recorded it, otherwise it would have been all in vain. It's unfair the people who are paying the price are the ones who will further be discriminated if they contract the virus. 

In days we ll see affluent get better care than the rest. lock-down was imminent 

but is there government help for all the employed and unemployed?

awaiting news.... Migrant workers are really taking the hit. They do not have home or saving like us to take the blunt of crisis. These people live and feed themselves on daily wage so can't lock themselves like us. If this virus hit India like US then Generations are going to remember this for a long time. I can’t imagine what’s like being offered food. I am very glad they are in India. Even though it has huge population and is very god country. helping hands reach every corner at tough times as every government scheme rwxhes every rural area. Ofcourse some goes unnoticed, everything can't be taken care of. They should be glad, they are back again in India and they will be taken care of. u/vredditdownloader no touching face ! These are tough times for everyone😞 Oh my god. My heart aches so much seeing this. Dear friends please stand up for one another. this chaos is because of unplanned lockdown by the govt This is heart-breaking, I cannot imagine the plight of these migrant workers. But he should not have been touching his face like that... Not during times like these. Hope this NGO offered sanitizers before giving them food. Both central and state governments have massively fucked up, everyone knew what was coming and still these people were left to die. [removed] why are they migrating back to villages, can't they stay in Delhi and Delhi govt can take care of the food and basic stuff. Shame on system!! IMO it is utterly insensitive & cruel to shoot on mobile phones like that when people in need & bad situation are eating an offered meal on road...its as cruel as shooting someone's video while dying.. these are self respecting & self earning individuals having a rough patch due to no falt of theirs but due to the knee jerk reaction by their government w/o any planning or addressing their valid concerns behind all the panic. Pseudo-entitled chutiyas on my feed are defending and patting the Govt on the back for this.

They really should be put through such circumstances so that next time they think of the 80% population who goes hand-to-mouth.

Fucking boils my blood on what have we elected to govern us. Heart-breaking, that's all I can say. What are the leaders doing? Playing Ramayana and promoting some narrative. Poor guy. I know exactly how that feels like. They deserve much more than this. This is barely covering their rights as humans. This government is ruthless... This is heartbreaking :( Why the fuck you filming that guy. Would you like someone to film you when you in this emotional state. For fuck sake give him some space. Shame on the person shooting this. Capturing someone's private emotions without their consent is absolutely deplorable. The least they could have done is blur the face. 

I have a question for you Redditors - how many of you would like your weak moment posted all over the internet, even if it were to prove a legitimate point? The Government should spend money on more infirmaries instead of making statues. If they take this situation as a lesson then next time we would be ready to tackle these kinds of situations. Look at this cunt, hes crying, just gonna stick my camera in his fuckin face Clips like these only serve at appealing to emotions over common sense. Why are migrant workers returning to their native places (and potentially bringing the disease to small villages), instead of sheltering in place? The whole point of shelter in place is to stop the spread of disease. And it’s only mandated for 21 days not indefinite. Here is a thread that I posted about the misery and utter helplessness this unplanned lockdown has resulted in for the labourers and poor. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpx36l/a_thread_on_how_this_regime_with_its_marvellous/ :( r/HumansBeingBros Well, stop fucking filming him then? Do you know how embarrassing it can be to be in a pathetic situation and then someone films your embarrassment?

It makes no difference to anyone whether he was crying or not. Or for fuckity sake atleast be discreet instead of shoving the camera in his face to capture how he breaks down in various photographic angles you sick cock. It would be so awkward for me if people were filming me while doing good things for me. It's like, are you doing this for me, or the cameras? Susashan ki sarkar hai
Lauda ki sarkar hai. I don’t think anyone speaks his language but the guy holding the camera is literally insulting him. He’s saying “get the fuck outta mah country you brow... curry stin... migrant worker! Stop stealing awur jerbs!” Lol maybe don’t leave your home? What a bitch",2020-03-28 18:00:42
Food,"A banner in Delhi requesting people not to leave, food and accommodation will be arranged by Delhi Government",417,frstgc,https://i.redd.it/4wy2vgsjvtp41.jpg,69,,Neglectedsince1994," I was initially surprised by the exodus of workers. But many interviews have clarified their thinking on the situation and I think it's quite valid. Basically, they're worried that if they fall ill, they have no support net in these city slums. Back home, they at least have family members to take care of them.

Given that politicians often have (or claim to have) their ears to the ground, they should have been aware of this insecurity. I think in hindsight it was better to announce a schedule for the lockdown a few days earlier, transfer funds to their accounts, run maximum number of trains and buses to take everybody back home, let people prepare and stock up, and then start the police curfew lathi raj. Instead, under the excuse of ""preventing panic"", they started with the last first, and now people can neither stay in cities nor go back to their homes, neither have food nor money. *“Recall the face of the poorest and weakest man you have seen, and  ask yourself if this step you contemplate is going to be any use to  him.”*     

 ―        Mahatma Gandhi The worst thing is he has been asking people for staying back for a number of days now.  Still, the anti-kejriwal propoganda is too high in UP right now I don't think Modi has consulted with state heads before declaring the lock-down and given them some time to prepare or listen to them which could have avoided mass exodus from cities like Delhi. This guy literally enforces ""Na khaunga, Na khane dunga"" - he won't prepare and won't allow other able leaders to prepare at state level. Jokes on Kejri 

Fun story - I was in an auto once at 4 am and the guy keeps asking me sir ye board padho. 
I asked him after reading 4 boards, bhaiyaa aapko chasma hai? 
He replied sir padh pata to ye na chalata Does anyone know if state CMs were told that there would be a lockdown beforehand? Kejriwal, he is such a good man to be a CM. He is gonna win next election too. He did tons of good things for poor and medium class families. Source: Sent by a friend

Sorry I had to brag a little about him being a Delhiite. rightfully the Chief Minister of the national capital. At the end of the day, the weakest Chief Minister did more to help his constituents than the Prime Minister.  Brilliant.

>The chances of survival of the virus will be less as the temperature goes up, but the exact impact is hard to predict. Whatever the impact, one thing is for sure, it will not be drastic.

&#x200B;

> While in case of some viruses one gets lifelong immunity after the first infection, in other cases that doesn’t happen. But there is no cross immunity — in the sense that an earlier infection caused by some other virus will give you immunity against the coronavirus.

&#x200B;

>There is no evidence that choice of food will make any difference in the spread of the virus. Food is certainly not the source of transmission. 

&#x200B;

>Respiratory infections spread by contact so there are normally restrictions placed on social mixing. A distance of 1-2 metres is good enough for an infection to spread. Who is this anti naashanal unkill? Clearly this man is an antinational and can't be taken seriously. Everyone I meet keeps saying that the virus won't survive once the summer comes. What they don't understand and what I'm tired of telling them is 1) There is no evidence for the claim. 2) Even if it doesn't survive summer, it will be winter in the southern hemisphere and there the virus can prosper, and then return to Northern Hemisphere after 4-5 months All this Indian immunity shit is fucking bullshit. Take all the necessary precautions please, wherever in the world you are. Not an expert, but from what I know: Viruses evolve very quickly. Given that, isn't it possible that the covid-19 will quickly adapt to Indian conditions? Can someone who is an expert clarify? We are not alien. Our immunity is same as other human being. 😒 ""Indian Immunity"" xD this Indian immunity trope needs to die.

Why he's trying so hard to make citizens of other states feel jealous?
Making Kerala god's own country. Kerala also has proactively begun sharing details about contact tracing and released two charts that show the movement of confirmed patients across the state before being diagnosed and quarantine that will help contain spread to some extent. Man this Kerala is 50 years ahead. Pinarayi is a great CM, very rational, scientific and a logical guy. Rest of the BJPee chutiyas are talking about gomutra I hope CPI-M revives it's cadres in other states too. We need them to play a formidable part in the opposition. There are not communist party in the hard-core sense now

There are trying to repackage themselves along the lines of socialist parties in Europe His statement was for the people who are suspected patients and not coming forward. Getting treatment, food and internet will make them feel comfortable and not left out. I bet Shylaja teacher is behind this strategy. She is the best health minister we have known till date.

Kerala: feels good to hear about the steps they have taken Haha as long as there's good connectivity, I'm fine. I saw the press con. It was really smartly played, if people of the state work together then it's easy to stop its contagion. Multiple warnings are issued to people who haven't yet gotten tested. And, the charts released are a big help too. Smartly the first priority is identifying the victims, and while identification takes place the government works on the secondary issues such as bandwidth, food etc. Gotta say I was impressed. Who would have thought a communist party will be so good under a democracy Meanwhile in Delhi - no work from home for lazy and dishonest citizens! Commies just doing what Govts are supposed to do. Every state/central govt should learn from Kerala's government. Can someone please point to the link to the twitter thread/video where this was said? 

I am not questioning the truth but the link attached by OP does not say what the title says. When zombies start walking from North, Kerala will be the last ray of hope. Do it for my lifetime, and I will never have to come out of my house. Does anyone else find it strange that large population centers like Mumbai are reporting nothing? In a dispersed and connected world, Mumbai would have showed up by now one would think. Either Mumbai is really lucky or Mumbai isnt checking anything at all.

Damn man, Kerala has serious game and a competent administration that is doing something atleast.",2020-03-10 23:26:21

Just a vague thought if there is big apartment or complex , if 1 apartment can donate a piece of vegetable or say couple of spoonful of rice or pulses and provide it to less fortunate families.

Kerala's capital was declared the first to go cashless after demonetization.

6. Kerala has also been declared as the first digital state.

village, yet another first in the country.

8. Kerala's the first state to achieve 100% primary education.

> New Delhi:

> From videos advising people not to follow social distancing rules to those suggesting Muslims are immune to coronavirus, the Delhi Police say they have uncovered a concerted misinformation campaign that poses a serious challenge to the government's efforts to contain the ongoing pandemic.

> In an investigation of the content being shared on WhatsApp and apps like TikTok in the first week of the nationwide lockdown, the Delhi Police said they have found many of the videos specifically targeting the Muslim community by quoting religious text and leaders.

> An analysis of more than 30,000 videos on the social networking over the last five days found that most of the fake information and posts are created in Hindi and Urdu for a specific audience, the police said.

> The videos were analysed by the police with the help of security researchers, fact checkers and data analysts and a report on the digital investigation has been accessed by NDTV. According to early estimates, more than 1 crore people have already seen these videos, suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact.

> ""Several of these videos appear to be shot in Pakistan and Middle East but audio in Hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in India,"" the 22-page report, which the Delhi Police has shared with various intelligence agencies, says.

> ""Our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising Muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill Muslims,"" a senior police official said.

> According to him, the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation.

> ""While analysing the origins and sources of these videos, it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin,"" he said.

> ""Considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software, being viralled (sic) on social media platforms, original uploader accounts being deleted, and certain accounts peddling fake news among Muslims are promoting Pakistani religious leaders with terror links. A further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated,"" the report says.

> According to the investigation, Chinese-owned video sharing app TikTok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus. These videos are further being shared on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.

> Videos of Muslims refusing to get themselves tested and beating medical personnel were being spread and others were also being encouraged to do the same, the report says.

> Religious texts are being quoted to not stop shaking hands and people are being encouraged to go to their religious shrines even during lockdown, it adds.

> Authorities have expressed concern about the impact of these videos amid attacks on medical personnel like in Madhya Pradesh's Indore this week and the emergence of a cluster in Delhi because of a gathering held by a Muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country.

> In the investigation into the Delhi congregation, the police are looking into a sermon allegedly by the chief cleric of the group Tablighi Jamaat that termed the directions of doctors as ""a conspiracy to keep Muslims away from fellow Muslims"".

> Since then, Maulana Saad Kandhalvi has officially issued an audio message to his followers asking them to cooperate with the government to fight the disease.

> ""We have to take precautions, follow the guidance of the doctors and give full support to the government such as not crowding into places. This is not against the principles of Islam,"" he said.

> While at around 2,000 cases and 53 deaths, the spread of coronavirus in India is far more limited than in Europe and the US, health experts have warned that the numbers could surge across the country if the contagion takes root. https://www.altnews.in/old-unrelated-video-shared-as-muslims-licking-utensils-to-spread-coronavirus-infection/

From the article :


>On searching Google with the keywords ‘Muslims licking plates’, we came across the same video on Vimeo, uploaded on 31 July 2018 by a user called Asghar Vasanwala. According to the description of the video, the people seen in the video are Dawoodi Bohras, who are licking the utensils in an attempt to follow their belief of zero wastage of food


>Furthermore, the website of the Dawoodi Bohras states that they follow a tradition of eating meals on a steel ‘thaal’, which is designed to accommodate a group of 8 or 9 people. They also strictly follow a policy of no wastage of food - “Bohras have a no-wastage policy so not a single morsel should be left on the thaal when it is taken away”. Wait till those guys see the water used in Pani Puris ...Covid 19 is a virus that hopefully would be cured  .. Communal hatred  is deep-rooted in India  ..ain't no cure for that  shit .. A friend of mine who hasn't messaged me in months randomly sent me one of these videos and said take care, because of these people we will all get sick. We need to do something about them. Its utter bullshit. I'm a Brahmin Hindu, and I know my kin well--they'll find any germ- or health-related excuse they can to fuck over Muslims. Very important question. These could be staged, doctored or old, or it could be new and true. What's disturbing is that many people aren't interested in verifying the sources, and a question like yours assumes you support that kind of behavior and is in denial of ""the truth"". But given the extent of hatred and division across the country, it is the question to ask. Goes against the agenda though There is another video circulating where a fruit seller appears to be licking his fingers as he rearranges fruits in his cart. If there is a non-malevolent interpretation for this, please do share, as it might help to clear the air in certain forums.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I had my Zomato order delayed last week, app showed him at the same place for a long time. Was getting annoyed because the Pizza would go cold and the restaurant was hardly 5 minutes away. When I called him he said he was delivering double orders due to the lock down. When I probed further, he revealed that the other order was placed for one address, but the customer asked him to deliver to another which was far off. When the executive refused saying he'll be penalized for going off route, they insisted he come there and they'd pay him 30 or 40 bucks. Being the naive fellow he was, he's gone there for the money and guess what, they've given him 10 bucks. When he expressed his disappointment, they've attempted to assault him. He was pretty shaken up. I told him not to worry and come to my place. Tipped him well and I was even more sad because the guy was very young. I learnt not to act hastily without empathy. He was likely hoping that you cancel the order. 
I have also heard of people taking the order ans asking delivery guy to not mark it as delivered and instead cancelling the order. 
This I heard from a ex delivery guy. All safety standards down the toilet. Post on social media to raise awareness. had a similar incident yesterday, where the app showed that the order was delivered when it wasn't.

reported it and got a refund. It's possible that police may be stopping the delivery guys at every barricade ??",2020-04-05 00:10:02

Homepage on the app is also being [redirected to Zomato](https://i.imgur.com/aNR6irw.png).

Zomato is giving 50% off on next three orders and 3 months Zomato Gold trial if you click on ""Go to Zomato"" from [UberEats app.](https://i.imgur.com/WtfGw3H.png) (Thanks to u/JPBabuaFromOttawa) This sucks because Uber Eats is the only service that never messed up my order and always gave me a refund when they were at fault.

I at least will continue not ordering from Zomato. I've had delivery drivers literally go missing with my food, or they'll give me a completely wrong order, and then refuse to refund anything. Worst of all, if this happens after midnight, other places in my area close down and the only thing I'll get to have for dinner that day is a dozen servings of ""Sorry sir, apologies for the inconvenience.""

It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it really sucks and they're incredibly unhelpful. I've paid for 2 or 3 orders worth 500+ bucks where I never saw the food before I stopped using Zomato except for Gold when eating out. Aye, This breaks my heart!

I was loyal customer of Uber eats since like start of 2018! At least in my area Uber eats was the best. 

Good offers, timely delivery and great customer service!

Godspeed Uber Eats, You will be missed... 😭 Sucks for international travelers who would only have Uber on their phones Uber Eats was better than Zomato  . 

They had better offers , better delivery, better service 

Zomato is still a lil clumpy and I don't think this is good for consumers as it can result in Monopoly...

Lets hope Swiggy ups the game fuck man! Uber eats was my favourite with all the discounts! Zomato is the worst! now only Swiggy remains

RIP 19 rs orders, 39 rs orders, 59 rs orders.. will miss them! Going to miss those outrageous discounts compared to zomato and swiggy Hope the employees and delivery guys are not fired. RIP Uber Eats. For me, it was always  Uber Eats> Swiggy> Zomato They're giving 3 months of Zomato Gold and Discount codes for 3 orders.

Pretty good deal IMO Ubereats was a saving grace for me back in college when it had just begun in Chennai. Guess all the undercuts bit them in their ass Well, this paves a much cleaner way for Amazon to enter the market and if that happens, Zomato would be their first kill in my opinion.
 Zomato has horrendous customer service while Amazon has one of the best ( in my opinion) Uber Eats failed to read the Indian market in food delivery. 

They focused on app design rather than adding more quality restaurants. I liked to use their app but it simply never had as many options as Swiggy or Zomato. 

For now, Swiggy remains to be the best app for food delivery. Bummer for me because I always felt customer service was better in Uber eats.

Also gave great offers which I think might have led to losses and ultimately the sale to Zomato This is sad! I ordered twice from Ubereats yesterday. Didn't know this would happen when I woke up. :/ My last Uber Eats order was just day before yesterday, they had massive subway offers all the time, overall their offers were much better and extremely professional when it came to delivery and handling, but I'd agree 80% of my orders were from swiggy and zomato. There were a few exclusive places in UE which I used order from because of offers and quality food. I guess those listings would get merged now. Oh crap Ubereats was really good and cheap compared to both rivals. I walk to the restaurant. That way, you'll get your order faster in Bangalore. So now the final war is between swiggy and Zomato? Zomato offers are nothing but adjustment and rounding off This is happening everywhere in the world. Deliveroo recently closed down in Germany, selling everything to the last remaining competition Lieferando, one of the shittiest delivery services. 

At least you have 2 options in India. Some places have only one! this i one news that has zero impact to me. i neither have ubereats, nor zomato, nor swiggy. i feel that these apps exploit the producers of food and are causing a lot of damage to the restaurant industry. i prefer to visit a restaurant, talk to the owner/staff, get to know then and i enjoy my meal more than an order in. This is why the free market sucks. Duopoly now and the customer gets screwed Thanks Uber eats for the memories Khana khau ki bc apps download karu? Zomato ate uber eats Man, this sucks. Uber Eats had great offers and seemed affordable compared to the other two. Also, their customer service was miles ahead of others, at least for me. Zomato still owes me ₹130 I think. Pretty weird why they did it. It was a dead company. The user base was overlapping. For 3 50 million dollars, they have not acquired anything ground breaking. Its just waste of precious money. It will be duopoly as it is other sectors too. More discounts on the way! Very bad Uber bhuko ka sasta sahara Investors - wait for the dip and buy $UBER. They got 10% stake in swiggy and zomato from a loss making segment which now also means more customers to swiggy and zomato. Does it mean uber ears will not be a part of my uber app? Zomato eats Uber Eats! I'm sticking to my pledge to never order cooked food from such apps. I either cook my food or go out for a nice dinner at a restaurant. Not gonna get into the habit of outsourcing 'cooking' food for myself. Quick question: Why was it an all-stock transaction and not a cash or partially cash transaction?
 I mean, imo, cash transaction is better than all-stock transaction in terms of operational freedom and profit sharing. Remember Letsbuy guys? Softbank pressure all around All these complaints against zomato are very surprising to me. I have never used Uber Eats and I believe you all who are saying good things. But zomato never messed up any order, and their delivery guys are pretty good. I always go back & forth between zomato & swiggy and choose the one giving a better deal. Swiggy has given me 1 or 2 mess ups but zomato never. F

Wish they sold it to Swiggy atleast. RIP uber eats This is why you go eat then & there, problem solved!
Just gotta use those at night sometimes tho.",2020-01-21 10:32:03
Food,How do I politely turn down food in India?,21,fr02ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fr02ak/how_do_i_politely_turn_down_food_in_india/,18,"Hey Reddit!

My boyfriend is from India and I am American.
He’s told me that in India, it’s rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

How can I politely refuse food if I am full? Is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? Thanks!",keylimepie1123," ""Aaj mera upwas hain""

Just learn this phrase Feel free to refuse. A lot of Indians don’t understand boundaries and therefore it’s upto you to have one.  It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I understand what you're trying to express, I used to be in a similar state by being an overeater/emotional overeater. Especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required. You could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them.

1. You could express yourself, and open yourself to them, so they wouldn't push you any further 
2. Pretend to be ""full"" before you actually are, so when they do stuff your plate with more foods, you don't feel sick. 
Or. 
3. As soon as you're done, you run to the kitchen to leave your plate. (Wouldn't really just that, but the idea was somewhat funny.)

Hope it helps! Besides, if they care for you, (as we try to show our affection by feeding others), they'd understand what you're going through and wouldn't be offended. 

Hope this helps! Tell them you are allergic to  carbs and vegetable oil. 

big chunk of options  will be taken off the shelf . One trick that works for me is: say you are full well before you are. They will push to eat some more, refuse it a couple of times and then have it :) Things not to do in life:

>Visit India when you are recovering from an eating disorder.

None of the advice people giving you on this sub will work when you are gonna see so much Delicious stuff and you would want to try each and every one of those. 

> How can I politely refuse food if I am full? 

You start saying ""I'm full"" when you have eaten 50% of what you want to eat! Just say ""Ewww"" at hit the hand holding the plate. ^/s Just say that you are stuffed and mentioned that you loved it. Usually works. I don’t smoke so whenever somebody offers or forces me a cigarette, I say “I just had one before coming here” haha Simple and short. Stay drama free. Put your foot down and say ""No, THANK YOU!""

Stay drama free and simple. Repeat
Say ""No, Thank You"" Arre nahi aunty pet bhar gaya aur nahi kha sakhti 

Sach main aunty pet full ho gaya. 


Isse teen chaar bar bol dijye. Tell them you or on a fast. Simple as that  just ask for a glass of water when they offer food

It works out for me Just say 'pehle aap lijiye'. Just say that you had a very late previous meal. For eg, if you're invited over dinner, tell them that you had a very late lunch. nahi chahiye ji. any karl rock fans up in this bitch?",2020-03-29 12:45:42
Food,This is a picture of Reliance’s Corporate Parks food court,342,ex2g8d,https://i.redd.it/j0c6b2xci9e41.jpg,148,,sinsandtonic," I am an employee at Reliance and I have been harassed multiple times for bringing chicken or fish in my lunch box. Employers have no business monitoring their employees tiffin boxes. 
[It started way back in 2013.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naazneenkarmali/2013/12/16/mukesh-ambanis-reliance-retail-chickens-out-turns-vegetarian/#29b88bf548df) TCS Bangalore does not serve non veg in its food courts. Funnily only in Bangalore offices for some reason I work in Anil's reliance's campus in Navi Mumbai for a client company. It is the same there. You cannot eat non veg on your desk either. People still eat non veg in campus though but you have to be careful not be seen by security. There is a hospital in Bandra, Mumbai frequented by celebs which doesn’t allow staff or patients to bring non-veg food inside. The security opens staff’s (esp nurses) lunch boxes and inspects your food! The restaurants and canteens inside are obviously ‘pure’ veg. Lmao, reminds of the time in elementary school when my classmates used to bully me for bringing chicken nuggets on Tuesdays. I worked in a school where majority Gujaratis sent their kids. One of the Koli (fishing community) kids used to be badly bullied and left alone for lunch because she brought chicken. She used to cry everyday. When I told the principal about this and how we should be teaching children acceptance she said that the parents would stop donating and pull kids out of the school so they couldn’t do anything. I ate lunch with that girl almost everyday instead. India hasn't moved on from the 1800's, it seems. No eggs? Brahminism and capitalism are best friends Corporate -Hindu Nexus is the rot of this country All weworks are veg too. Why no objection to that?

Ref:

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/13/wework-meat-events-expense-ban [deleted] It's private place. They have all rights to frame such rules.
Think of those minority like Jains or others who don't eat non-veg. It causes them be discomfort sitting in same area where non-veg is served or is being eaten. This is fine with me.  I guess the rest of the food court is strictly non-veg. Vegetarianism is obviously the right choice, but it still has to be a 'choice'. Dhokla Dhokla everywhere I'm about to join Reliance corporate park . Can I PM you for some questions please ? BJP ka vote yahaan gintey nahi hai, Thokey jaatey hain! From what I heard from employees in Reliance Jio, there are dedicated inspectors who roam in the building to check if anybody is eating nonveg. And they've even fired some ppl, solely for this reason! It is also worth mentioning that they didn’t give a holiday on Christmas. I don't care what you eat at home but in my premises I will absolutely enforce food regulations. Why? Because it's my property and there are smells I like and dislike.

As long as the shareholders of Reliance (or whichever subsidiary) agreed to this policy, I don't see anything wrong with it. Many employees must be dying due to malnutrition. So sad.",2020-02-01 15:10:04

If nations with far advanced public and health infrastructures@ like Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Iran are rapidly moving towards a state of emergency (Italy has gone into total lockdown as of this morning) then Indians are sitting ducks for reasons you probably know better than me. I don’t want to raise panic, but I want to quietly prepare for the possibility of a massive outbreak. 

**How should I go about stockpiling food?** Frozen food and canned food are out of options as my region already gets frequent and overlong power cuts on normal days and the latter isn’t readily available. 

What items would you stock on that’d have a long shelf life? 


@ - Obviously talking about the appalling state of government hospitals in India and the general doctor to patient ratio",KenjanRozu," indian food is easiest to stock. buy rice, flour, pulses, potatoes etc. Umm, there won't be a lockout in India. If it breaks through, it breaks through. The virus has a very high infection rate and comparatively, low mortality rate. So, by the time the government realizes that this has gone out of hand, it will be irretrievably out of hand, lockout will cost more lives than the virus itself. &#x200B;

To start with

Stockpiling in Indian context(Hope It wont be necessary  ), not restricted to food 

\---------

Cash

Grains, flours and Pulses of choice (Uncooked)

Milk powder

Baby food (If there are babies at home)

Pet food

Drinking water or RO machine

Pickles , dried veggies

Ghee and Oil

Emergency medicines

Dry fruits

Nuts

Gas lamp

Fruit Juices Tropicana/paper boat/ Pulpy orange

Powerbanks

Any board games or indoor game equipment,

Predownload  Youtube /Netflix/ Amazon prime videos to keep one self entertained .

Perfumes and wet wipes if water problem is anticipated .

Handwash r/coronavirus has lots of info on this Buy lots of maggi if its available there easy to store and cook Medicines for next months are really important, they should be of highest priority as the active ingredients that are used in making those have stopped coming in from China. Prices will start shooting up if that does not get restored in another couple of weeks. Please don't Panicking is only gonna make it worse... It isn't that bad...

Food,"[Food] Dinner last night.. Fish fried with a crust of dry peanut chutney, served with herb and rice, and conout milk gravy",206,fcrzos,https://i.redd.it/eostfukqbfk41.jpg,25,,gintea_balance,"  Recipe for Fish:

* Take a white fish and fillet it.
* Brush the side with beaten eggs
* Sprinkle peanut chutney on it. Press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (Refer peanut chutney details at end of comment)
* flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it
* Fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat

Recipe for rice:

* Cook rice as you normally do (I used a rice cooker).
* After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil)

Recipe for coconut milk gravy:

* In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.
* Add in chopped tomatoes and mix
* add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.)
* mix spices and wait for oil to be released.
* add 1 can of coconut milk and mix.
* bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

Plating:

* Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer
* place fried fish
* use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
* garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

Peanut Chutney:

Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home:

* Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
* peel off any remaining skin
* pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
* You can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture. That looks fantastic! It's got me in the mood for a second lunch Rice looks a bit overcooked or is it broken rice? I've never heard of using peanut as a coating but I do love peanut chutney. Thanks for the idea! Looks like KFF I think you had too much water in rice while cooking Not a huge fan of fried fish (why make a healthy thing unhealthy), but this looks good. Why bro...why?? Please don't post beautiful pictures of food. I'm dying of frustration (and hunger too). Kon hai ye MasterChef? Kyun post karte ho aisi dishes jo main sapne me bhi na bana paun? Looks so delicious.  

Would omit the oregano myself, but it appears you've used it judiciously. We have beef!!! Whats the point, the fish isn't deboned. This is really a sight for sore eyes in this sub. That aside, I love the colours.",2020-03-03 17:08:46
Food,Zomato guy questions my food choice. (Beef),626,eqtfll,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eqtfll/zomato_guy_questions_my_food_choice_beef/,194,"I'm a keralite living in Bangalore.
Ordered beef fry from zomato last night and here's how the conversation panned out

Agent: Where are you from?
Me: Kerala.

Agent: oh no wonder you ordered beef. Do all you  kerala people eat beef?
Me: Not really but it's one of our favorite dish.

Agent: Are you a Christian?
Me: Hindu

Agent: Then why do you eat beef ? Dont you believe in God? How can you eat beef?
*was really taken aback by that question* 
Me: Umm it's very common I don't find anything wrong with that.

Agent: The other day I saw a kerala guy selling beef and he had photos of God in his shop. 
Me: hmmmmmm.


I then went home and ate the beef fry, ordering it again tonight. So good.",Beers_and_Cheers_," with the way things are right now, i'm surprised he didn't spit on your food and deliver it to you. I've only eaten beef this one time and it nearly killed me. 

The meat was nice, the lynchers on the other hand not so much. I'm a mostly-vegetarian Hindu who can eat meat if there is no veggie alternative, or if said alternative has been had three times in a row. There's only so much salad I can do. This isn't for moral reasons; not having grown up eating meat means that the taste and texture are still alien to me. But I defend the practice of meat eating to my conservative friends and family. I tell them to (a) stop being hypocritical and (b) learn about other Hindus in India. 

I point to their and their children's leather shoes and ask whether the cow voluntarily donated its skin, and whether it continued to live after they were well shod. 

I point to the fact that of the top six exporters of beef in the world, three are Hindus. What do they feel about it? 

Millions of Hindus visit the Kullu Dusshera festival, where animals are sacrificed and the meat is eaten as prasad. The head priest of the Hidimba temple does the sacrifice. 

Some of their favourite BJP politicians wear leather shoes, and some, such as Sangit Som (one of the most vicious anti-beef proponents) have owned meat-exporting companies. Overall, beef  exports have risen under the Modi regime. DM me your best place to order beef from For an average Keralite beef with beef is a cultural shock. Its also very strange when peope talk of steak as the go to beef dish. Jesus Christ That is why I don't feel comfortable ordering off Zomato or anywhere else cause I feel like they are quitely judging my food choice but then again I am wayy to lazy to make my own food 😂😂 so Zomato it is It's just ignorance. Imagine if you saw someone ordering something like an octopus. You would be surprised at it, not necessarily in a malicious way, but just because it's not common and is generally considered taboo. You're lucky that the guy wasn't more aggressive.

However, I think it's the responsibility of the companies to train their employees not to judge people or make comments about their choices. Was the Delivery person from Zomato or Jomato? 
If Zomato surprising, if Jomato then Bhaiyya checks out. I drink alcohol and almost every time I drink 'socially' somebody will ask/tell ""you are a muslim, you are not allowed to"". We are inherently nosy. Judgemental people, I don't see that changing any time soon. As long as nobody gets hurt , I am fine. Looks like this guy was genuinely curious, rather than judgemental and accusing.  If yes, you might have missed a golden opportunity to convert a *bhakt* into a normal human being. He needs to be educated on how people choices when it comes to food shouldn't be an issue 

For education  is something that fight against ignorance Isn't basically all beef in India buffalo meat? I never understood this business. I've been having beef in India all my life, but I've never seen ""cow meat"" being sold. It's been always buffalo meat. I can't say that it's true for entire country. But the chances of cow meat in India being sold is still pretty low. Should have asked him, why they are selling it. I also cooked beef today and I am a Brahmin from WB. Beef Pasanda Zindabaad! Get this delivery guy's name and tweet this conversation to Zomato senior management. Even if they dont hold an enquiry, it will stop other delivery fellows from nosing into the habits of their customers. The shaming and violence aspect comes from casteism. This is completely different from the choice based vegan movement in the west. Hi. I am part of Zomato's marketing team. Can you please share the order ID with me so that the concerned team can look into this at the earliest? Thanks. Don't yOu bELive iN gOd???? You should report him to Zomato. It's not his job to question your food choices Freedom of food. I don't mean this in a condescending way but why should the delivery people even know what you're ordering? That's your and restaurant's business. we indians are too much worried about others Nepal is quite a Hindu country as well. Nepalese/Hindus eat beef like crazy, not cow though. I just don't happen to understand us, the Hindus of India. Be careful bro. Better go to a restaurant and eat rather than getting it delivered by brainwashed Sanghis. Just call customer care and get him fired. So now u got beef with zomato. Yesn't. Fuck them. This kind of stuff reduces my belief in ..religions. What you did was wrong and you should not do that again. Instead, eat the beef in front of the delivery boy. r/ThatHappened TIL people converse with zomato guys. You need to report this. This shouldn't be encouraged. Post it on Twitter or something. This is not something to be encouraged. The poison is spreading fast. I hope you raised a complaint against the scumbag. Which restaurant? I want to buy it. From where did you order? I mean people should realise it’s possible to be Hindu and eat beef! Beef eating was a well-kept secret and none of my extended family knows. Even now when I live in a different country I keep it a secret around my Indian (Hindu) friends because they are religious and won't be able to handle it. u/Beers_and_Cheers_ Report him to Zomato if they do have such an option. Its absolutely none of his fucking business to talk to customers about their food & this should not be encouraged. That idiot might even assault future customers. Be very careful about ordering Beef online. I remember that during the Gujarat riots these attackers had a list of people who were seen around beef stores in the old city. They attacked any beef eater. Please avoid ordering beef online. OP, what are good beef places to order from in Bangalore? send the email transcript to the ceo? People like him need some training You didn't offer him a bite? that's bad :D Why do I feel this story was written like the way r/indianpeoplequora posts are? Vegetarians, vegans and Hindu fanatics don't understand the freedom of choice. Like bro its my choice to consume what I want you shouldn't poke your nose in it.

Likewise its the cattle farmers decision whether to sell its meat or sell milk or use it for farming or whatever other uses the animal provides. Next time ask for a discount because you are a Hindu ordering beef 


:) r/thathappened I'm pretty conflicted about the beef issue

On the one hand I'm all for freedom of choice. At the same time, I'm under no delusion that eating beef - or any other meat - is a benevolent act.

Eating beef becomes even more problematic when you consider the environmental impact of raising beef cattle

I really don't know what side to go with this issue. Freedom or environmental benevolence? Screenshot pls... Am regular user of Zomato, never had to chat to any ""agent"" I don’t think that was bad, he was just curious might help open his mind as long as he was aggressive or threatening. It's your food choice and you are free to eat what ever. However, from an environmental perspective eating beef is a poor choice, because you know the belching that a cow and water buffalo produces and all that methane causes green house effect. As an atheist and vegetarian I am okay with people eating beef as long as they don't mind people eating dog meat . Sounds soooo fake, but ok Screenshot or it didn't happen.",2020-01-19 15:40:29

Food,Australians trapped in India's coronavirus lockdown fear running out of food and water,65,fr2jnq,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/australians-trapped-in-indias-coronavirus-lockdown-fear-running-out-of-food-and-water,4,,ShortTesla_Rekt5," I have no sympathy for them when they are not more disadvantaged than an average Indian. 

But an average Indian currently in Australia is much worse off than an aussie. 

While many less wealthy countries are doing the right thing, Australia is doing its best not to look after the temporary residents saying that they are only visa holders. So government has no responsibility. 

In contrast to this, all foreigners in Portugal with pending applications will be treated as permanent residents from Monday until at least July 1, this ensures migrants have access to public services during the corona virus outbreak. 

Applicants including asylum seekers need only provide evidence of an ongoing request to qualify, granting them access to the national health service, welfare benefits, etc. Temporary residents in Australia are not even covered by national health insurance scheme and beleive me many don't have health insurance. 


Our own temporary visa holders in Australia won't be getting any benefit from their government. While Aussie citizens and PR holders will be entitled to receive benefits, many people on visas even those who pay the same amount of tax and are as disadvantaged by the situation, will now be asked to fend for themselves.

Meanwhile when it affects their own citizens all the rules go out of the window, for example recently Australian government allowed all international students to work unlimited hours as opposed to normally allowed 20 hours a week, as long as they are working in supermarkets stocking shelves for Aussies.

I am hearing news from smaller towns and cities for example Adelaide, where some Indian groceries are helping students giving free rations as many have lost their casual jobs.

On top of that, many people who came to India on bridging visas which has condition to return back within 3 months, Australian government has placed travel restrictions for 6 months, yes it only applied to temporary visas. Doesn't matter if you are living there from last 5-10 years. 

Now these people are stuck in India and many have lost their dream of getting residency, what's worse is they can't even go back to settle their affairs and sell their belongings, say their goodbyes. The government refuses to extend the deadline on their entry due to no fault of their own because they are visa holders and not Australians.

I can go on and on with the list.........",2020-03-29 16:16:57

15. Medical and Paramedical training will be provided.
16. Healthcare will be the first priority of every state from now on.
17. Please don't pay attention to fake news.
18. PLEASE Don't take any medicines before you consult any doctor at any cost, it could be fatal.
19. Take care of your family, The only way we can get through this is by maintaining this lockdown
20. Please follow all the rules and guidelines given out by WHO and Central Government.

\--End of Speech-- (Now correcting if I put anything wrong here, although I'm sure I didn't miss anything)

Tl:DR

1. Social distancing is the only way to fight this.
2. 21 days will decide our fate.
3. Whole country under Lockdown (consider it a curfew only) until 14th April (21 days)
4. ALL ESSENTIAL SERVICES WILL REMAIN FUNCTIONAL. [deleted] Actually appreciate what the government is doing. Lots of western countries with much better health care systems have been lax and look what has happened. Really regretting not getting my hair cut last weekend... Glad that India is taking seriously. Hopefully the government has contingency plans in place for daily wage labourers and others who can't survive without working. My father is undergoing second chemotherapy tomorrow, not sure what is happening.

Guys I am scared.

Edit: the main issue is no shops were open in Chandigarh, Mohali area where the medicine required for the chemo is being sold. They are not even answering the phones. We were hoping on tomorrow but now I am wondering if those medical stores will be open.

[These](https://i.imgur.com/WaWnKtE.jpg) are the two [medicines](https://i.imgur.com/1uvYI2K.jpg).


Edit 2: Had a call with one of the dealers, he says the shop (selling the required medicines, situated in Sector 11 Chandigarh) will be open by 0900 tomorrow. God bless this country especially the poor.

Edit 3: [UPDATE : March 25]

ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ

Yeah boys, we got the medicine today, though one of the salt iv solution were not available (from one brand).

Yesterday, one of the redditor in the oncology field advised to use the same medicine from a different brand.

Our doctor confirmed this too.

So we bought that medicine drug and everything went smooth from there on.

My mother and I are so relieved, thank you for so many replies, suggestions and support. You guys rock

Probably should mention the situation in Chandigarh, we did notice that people are rushing towards medical stores like every other general essential services and there were long queues of people there.

I do feel, proper system framework is required to enforce this curfew. My friend is undergoing Radiation therapy for her stage 3 cancer.   
I've been accompanying her to the hospital and back, have our own hired car.   
I hope this doesn't become an issue. If people weren't hoarding shit before, they sure as hell will now.

Needs to go into the nitty gritty. Everybody already gets the big picture. Just returned from market. Purchased medicines,veggies ,fruits. Thanks God How do ""Essential services will remain open"" and ""Total ban on stepping out, forget what going out meant"" go together? Even if the grocery stores are open, what is the procedure to go out?

There is an urgent need to clarify this. Its utterly chaotic around my neighbourhood. Which countries are dealing with coronavirus in the best way possible? Home ministry to give detailed report on the exemptions soon. Food? Vegetables? Medicine?

But, I do hope people don't buy in panic... https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1242469980165140480

>UPDATE: All essential services to continue and remain functional. List of essential services remains unchanged since the March 22nd 'Janta Curfew' #Coronavirus

>Letter from MHA regarding lock down and list of essential services.

Hope it clears all the doubts I might be agreeing with the man for the first time Will food delivery work? Exactly what steps are being done for essential services? I'm not stocked for 21 fucking days! Good speech. No theatrics. On point. Laid bare the threat, and announced strict but necessary measures. #Jaan hai toh jahaan hai Why didn't he say anything about groceries and medicines? That is literally the first thing I am worried about.

Edit : I saw PMs tweet. Wish he had said it in his speech. I am also skeptical as to how this is going to work. And  am hopeful it won’t be like demonetisation where there was no planning for implementation. Fingers crossed! DD News Live Link, rewind a bit to see PM Modi's Speech with English Subs

https://youtu.be/EaOsJRru-YQ Nice. He's saying don't listen to rumors and fake news. Only take meds that are approved by doctors. Hope these cow dung aficionados are listening to this. [deleted] Shouldn't we declare national emergency, so people can relax on bank emi's, rent, electricity bills etc. What does this mean? We can't go out for even essential services? Man, it feels good to be finally agreeing with our Prime Minister on something. I am not understanding what lockdown means, will we be able to buy Groceries and things like that because our current stock will last just 4 more days I think. If yes, then anyone could possibly walk around and say they are out to buy groceries.

Will there be any sort of punishment for those caught roaming freely? If yes, then on what basis ? Essential supplies are going to be available. [Please do not panic. Please.](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1242476408896507910?s=19) Hope people don't draw a line with lakshman rekha (pesticide) on their doors to keep the virus at bay from tomorrow. Who know we may see some WhatsApp message like the rohini nakshatra one. Good luck Indian friends, respect from Chile how do we get essentials now? big names like grofers/bigbasket are not delivering, we can't even go out. One thing I find disconcerting is the lack of transparency and finer details regarding a lot of things. There are no clear guidelines on how and when the people in isolation or quarantine are going to be tested/treated or discharged.

Then regarding the essential supplies. It's not clear what all is available and can be bought and from where. And what about the supplies from the government to the people who need it the most.

Hope there would be clarity regarding these things in the coming times. Dont panic and purchase a lot guys kirana shop and pharmacy and milk shop are always open My family has a seasonal business. This is gonna fuck shit up this year for us. Happened with GST and we were finally recovering this year. Fml. https://imgur.com/a/K23PvpJ

Detailed order.


P.s. It's a great read tbh. My Grandfather is bedridden and is on life support i need protein powder which won't available till tomorrow he can't eat on his own he will starve my god i am so scared they were run out in all the shops...

Also all veggies are sold on gaadi..so no veggies? i am confused and 3 week complete lockdown? food runs out what then? what happens if some building water supply breaks..?

Also people don't really care about social distancing no one is following it fuck this could be it. I'm all up for this, but what do I do about pet supplies? I need cat litter for my cats.

Edit: What's with thr downvotes, I'm genuinely asking. What if someone's pet needs food and stuff? This is a tricky situation. My dad is stuck in his posting. He can't come back home. He is alone and will have to manage everything himself now. Cooking and stuff. Hope he stays alright Lockdown has been initiated. It's a thing we really needed and I'm glad that this shit will finally be taken seriously by people. I just hoped he would have been clear about the essential supplies as people are swarming to stores right now. They are scared, and I empathize with them because people get afraid. PM should have emphasized that people should not go out now. Now, because of the crowding, there will so many more people who will get infected. I expect cases to rise even more now, because of this.

Another thing that should be done ASAP is **educating the goddamn cops with what are essential goods and not to just laathi charge people going to buy vegetables or medicines.** Sure, beat the shit of people loitering or taking selfies of empty roads but for fucks sake, stop harassing people who are out buying essentials. An acquaintance of mine was not only hit by cops but was given a lecture as to why he didn't stock up on vegetables earlier. Do these dense idiots not realize vegetables don't last very long?

Also, please don't forget your pets. Buy food for them when you're picking up supplies for yourself.

I hope we get through this. Best of luck everyone. Goodbye guys. It was nice knowing you all. Finally!!! Now that this has started, I want to ask how can we help the poorest of the people in the country. People who earn 100-200 rupees per day and will go hungry or be under huge amount of debt if they can't work for a few days. Are there any NGOs we can donate to that can help such people with food and essentials during these times. 

Lock down will have to continue past April 15 for the virus to be completely contained but a very good start. Let's take it one step at a time. If people cooperate and the state provides the hospitals with enough medical supplies, we can come out of this pretty come summer. Fingers crossed. I wish he had emphasised in his speech that essential services would remain open. People went beserk and started rushing out and hoarding food to prepare for the lockdown which was unnecessary  Yesterday, I commented on this thread that I am having to go to the hospital during this lockdown on weekdays. My friend (from Nodia, WB) is presently living with us (Kolkata, WB) for her Stage 3 cancer treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital, New Town, Kolkata. Her radiation will be going on for 28 days, Monday to Friday.

We have hired a car. We carry papers and ID (including patient ID) and even have a signboard on the car saying that it's going to the hospital. Today, while we were inside the hospital, our driver was beaten up by the cops at the parking lot, just in the same way you guys are seeing in the videos that are being shared online. He stated the reason why he was there. The cops did not contact us or anything, he was simply beaten up.

This is anarchy.

I am not on social media other than Reddit and I do not intend to be because of how unreasonable people are in general. However, I would like to inform you all that certain cops are beating up people, whether they have a reason to or not. They are not communicating at all. We are trying our best to find out which police personnel exactly did this and take the relevant legal steps after the lockdown is lifted. I do not think that the police have orders to beat up anyone they wish to.

I would also like you all to warn others. And if you or any person you know is presently deployed to police the roads during the lockdown, kindly let us know what rules/instructions you have. Because today, it seemed like you have none. Nagma from ndtv just said that their studio is already getting pictures of people gathering in numbers and panic buying groceries. Shit is fucked up. Does this mean people will scramble to shops between now at midnight?

If doing it for hoarding, these four hours might do more damage. Let's hope this doesn't gets extended beyond 21 days [deleted] * There is a huge population of India which is dependent on day to day daily wages to survive . A 21 day lockdown pretty much screws them over badly . Now ,  I know many state governments have announced relief measures and central government is going to continue MGNREGA , but we all know the track record of the governments with their welfare schemes , especially in such a short time period .


* There is also a significant population of India who have been at the receiving end of this government's discriminatory policies . Many of them have 0 trust in the government ( I am not making a moral judgement ,I am just stating a fact ) . 



* The government's track record with previous such moves hasn't been really good . Demonetization was a train wreck . Article 370 was similarly a train wreck . GST was a disaster despite years of preparation  . Now we are supposed to believe that the various government will effectively pull off all necessary arrangements for this lockdown in a matter of few days ?


* 21 days of lockdown won't defeat coronavirus . It will return with a vengeance . The only way of dealing with it is mass societal awareness and changing our behaviour permanently . This 21 days lockdown will be useless if it creates a false sense of security and people just go back to their old habits Petrol pumps in Pune have been closed for private vehicles since yesterday, even though they are covered under essential services during this lockdown. If groceries, milk and medicines are not available nearby, how is one supposed to travel? What if there is a health emergency and need for visiting hospitals? Other alternate modes of transport are already banned or stopped..and now we cannot even use our own vehicles?! This is fked up..and starting to feel as if the ‘cure’ is worse than the problem.This also gives an example of how local authorities (Collector, in this case) can override orders from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Much needed decision.
We need to break that process!!! [deleted] Banks also shut? People crowded the grocery shops nearby my place, I wanted to buy some stuffs but I noped out seeing the crowd. Probably will check tomorrow morning if any stock left in those shops. :/ Railway has been ordered to make beds for quarantine/hospitals work has begun. I don't have much to be tensed about this lockdown but I am thinking of the poor who depend on their daily wages to eat. It's a check mate move 
Only time will tell if it's for economic or  virus For three weeks. Honestly, I'm happy they're taking this so seriously. Now just tell his own party members to stop taking out fucking processions. Absolute genius. He’s just saved thousands of lives. He had the balls to do what Trump did not. 

He said - “I understand that the lockdown will have an economic impact, but right now my first priority is the lives of Indian citizens.” What happens to the poor? Needs immediate cash transfer so they can stock things. I'm afraid deaths due to hunger and poverty will cross Corona. My dad's a doctor and will need to travel. How can we ensure that he doesn't get hit by a danda? Today I've seen videos of police beating up people in cars, bikes even before asking them what they're doing out there. These videos are from the chowk just outside my house. I'm so scared for my dad right now, he's 60, there's the risk of the actual fucking coronavirus and then the police brutality going on. Medical professional here. The heathcare professionals who are supposed to look after you, the citizens, can only do what they can with the supplies they are given. Most of the doctors do not have masks or any protection equipment for themselves. Especially in govt. Hospitals. We have to buy our own. The hospital administrations of govt. hospitals are corrupted. They wouldn't equip the casuality sect. of the hospital properly in normal times but are trying to do better in these testing times. 

Please do your part and stay home. 

Lot of people are roaming recklessly on the streets. These are the same people who, when they get infected, would come to hospital and complain that they are not being treated like royalty. India is a country with 1 doctor for 1500 people. We do not have enough masks and ventilators available for a crisis. Please understand. 
People who are complaing about getting bored while staying home- think about all the people who do not have the same luxury as you - all the health care professionals, delivery people, police , army, DAILY WAGE WORKERS. Stop being a prick and thank your luck that you are not out there battling this. 

PLEASE DO YOUR PART AND STAY HOME. People here in Bengaluru (Kormangala) are swarming shops and grabbing on to anything they can find. Total fucking chaos here. I am just worried about the stray animals! I hope the Gov will feed them till the lockdown so no one gets out to feed them! This is a very essential move I support it completely! Where's my free pornhub subscription. This lockdown means nothing if we aren't testing extensively to find most, if not all, of the infected cases. And yet, people crowded markets today wanting to buy flowers and fruits to celebrate Ugadi. :( It's literally a Rest in Home or Rest in Peace situation. Wow no water supply as well. Govt. says don't die of Coronavirus, but hunger and thirst. Every mofo who labeled anyone a fear-monger for sounding the warning bells here on Reddit and elsewhere can go fuck themselves.

Sanity has prevailed. Thank god for that. Need to ration my essentials and consume less food. It's saying essential goods will be available, does that include groceries?? Govt listed E-Commerce under the list of exceptions, during the lockdown period, to deliver all essentials like food, medicine and groceries. 

But Amazon Pantry, Big basket, Swiggy stores, grofers, dunzo, etc have all stopped taking orders. 

Police are beating up delivery executives on roads. Ye madarchod HIV hi thik tha, jo pelta tha vo hi jelta tha 4 weeks from tonight here in NZ. Welcome fellow isolationists! [""Keep the laathi away, please don't beat the delivery boys"": K Ganesh, Promoter, BigBasket, Fresh Menu.](https://twitter.com/ndtv/status/1242766640132919296) How insensitive can one get 🤬

These are difficult times & what he is carrying only essential supplies, right? 

Why should he be beaten black & blue like he is some criminal 😞

Indian police, you can do better. 

#Covid19Out #Lockdown21 #lockdown 

https://twitter.com/santoshspeed/status/1242819959387914241?s=19 Should have assured people on how essentials are gonna be delivered. I can be really fucking anti-modi but the actions the Modi government is taking to fight the coronavirus are really appreciable (apart from the clapping shit but again that can be excused as a way to encourage the doctors and make them feel good about it). So yeah I am kinda proud of India rn. [removed] No mention who the government is going to take care of the poor. Day labourers don't have savings to survive 21 days without work. If COVID-19 isn't going to kill them, starvation will. At the state level, other than Kerala and Delhi, no other state is stepping up. 

Is there any plan out there for the poor? Lmao when modi picked the poster up, he indirectly wanted to say that the country is full of a bunch of morons. bachho ki tarah samjhana padh raha hai inko. Sir, that's all okay. What about the people who depend on their daily wages? And about essential services? Homeless people? What are the daily wage workers gonna do man? This is necessary but I wonder what they'll eat? I shit you not, as soon as I heard complete lockdown from 12 AM I took my scooter and ran to the market. It was completely deserted, and the most famous grocery store of the entire fucking city had its shutter down, but was operating from insides, probably packing orders for people who sent them lists. I had to plead to him to give me 2kg almonds, which he did, and I sighed in relief. If we were gonna go on lockdown at 12, shouldn't he have preponed the address to say, morning? Given us time to stock up on food, medicines for 21 days. It’s fucking happening !!! Alexa play Dooriyan hai zaarori Anyone who's loved ones still have to go to work? How do you guys feel? My mom works in BSNL so she has to go and my dad is scared shitless that she might catch the virus. :/ So main question. How are we supposed to go out and get groceries? I know the shops will be open, but there's no guarantee that police won't lathi charge us even if we tell them we are going to buy groceries.   
Will online retail groceries still deliver? Heard that Reliance is going all out, does this apply to their grocery retail stores too? Will they assure us deliveries for the whole month? ALSO, This might happen in the coming days.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.ladbible.com/news/news-italian-leader-warns-police-with-flamethrowers-will-enforce-lockdown-20200324.amp.html And the people flocking to grocery stores as if there is no tomorrow, while possibly spreading the infection. When if this is what he intended, he's doing a bangup job! Bhai people are panic buying now, the whole point is dead BC sabko condoms free me baaton, population ka bhi dhyan rakh liyo bhai.. They should also put hold on rent, education loans and mortages. This could help a lot of people who work on the frontline. Why not the same thing can be said earlier like before noon or in afternoon.

Why does this guy chose 8 pm for every such announcement This shit is going to spread like wildfire through the slums of India. I think India is going to be have the largest death toll. So many humans packed butts to nuts. How can you get 1.3 billion people, many of whom are extremely poor and just scraping by day to day, comply? Will e-commerce like amazon and Flipkart be still working? no layer masks selling for 50rs.
3layers costing more
N95 unknown brands for 400rs.
I contacted employee of supermarket chains easyday+more and both said they have shut shops till 31st march. Shutters were down. No grocery shop opened. Saw crowd at one shop and the guy said he's selling products at his own risk. The same said by chemists. Thankfully chemist shops near govt. hospital showed much confidence in their operation. 

Shop owners are waiting for ""Pass"" from local jurisdiction to start operating legally. 

Right now Governments are spreading the virus by their no planned hasty moves. >Supporting a govt decision during crisis does not mean one should stop critical thinking process. A thought lockdown would lead to groupthink & thus sub-optimal decisions. So, indulge me as I pose some questions as to whether a 21 day lock-down is feasible or even desirable?

https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1242779897384198144.html On TV, rickshaw drivers cycling home from Delhi to Bihar. That's about 1,000 km. Others are walking home. Homeless shelters are packed. 
And the govt has nothing to say, no plan.

https://twitter.com/samar11/status/1242823667664351232?s=19 THOUSANDS have collected at shelter homes where Delhi govt has directed cooked food be provided. Overcrowded, overwhelmed- shelters don’t have adequate ration & infrastructure. Govt needs to ensure cooked food distribution at all anganwadis & govt schools also #21daylockdown

https://twitter.com/AnjaliB_/status/1242777027763003393?s=19 Why he always does this, come 4-5 hours before midnight and does something that creates panic? Because of this, there are lines in front of ration shops.

But we all should appreciate what he did as it is good for us. 

We all should follow this.

All the best everyone for the next 21 days. For 21 days Making my youtube debut with how to gain 21kgs in 21 days. Thank you PM Saab. Guys, the pornhub logo has changed to stayhome-hub logo today... did anyone notice? Given the seriousness of coronavirus this might be required. The problem though is how do people get their essentials?

I have stopped going out of my house and ordering using bigbasket. But guess what, yesterday Karnataka implemented Sec. 144 and rumor is that Bigbasket delivery people were beaten by the police because they are not classified as essential service. So Bigbasket cancelled all the deliveries.

Couple of nearby grocery shops are slowly running out of items. Talking to them it seems that the wholesaler vehicles are not delivering items. No bread, no drinking water, no biscuits. Nothing being delivered.

Now PM comes online and just throws out 21 days lockdown without outlining the big problem - How are people going to get groceries? State governments will have guidelines is not good enough. He should outlined some steps.

People in my locality are in full on panic mode. People climbing over each other to get stuff giving a middle finger to social distancing. He is afraid of  ""if all religious people go away..who the hell will vote for me"". Am I the only one who thinks PM should have made this announcement a few days earlier? People could have used these few days to stock up and not create chaos. Instead, he gave the bartan/bhaanda speech and sent confusing signals about Govt action plan. You have to agree , when this man knows shit's serious , he can use that charisma expertly . Not his biggest fan but I really respect and appreciated his view and action on this serious matter . For 21 days! Big decision! Big balls But what about the bills? How are people living paycheque to paycheque supposed to pay bills? They should put a hold on that too I appreciate the nice picture ITCell rustled up using clipart. A delayed decision but a good one nevertheless.

Also, should have given a longer window instead of just 3-4 hours. This is exactly what happened during demo that sent everybody into a frenzy. People in my neighbourhood are out on the streets and panicking. 

A decision this big for a country of 1.3 billion should not have been taken at such a short notice. Why wasn't this announced today morning? I'm all for a lockdown and I appreciate the decision; the execution and timeliness—not so much. What a Royal mess.

This one night after the speech is enough to spread the virus far beyond control in India. Ok, he did almost everything properly.

Wasn't clear about essential services 🤦‍♂️ Guys I'm scared. We don't have rations to live for 21 days. Wtf are we supposed to do? This sucks for the daily wage labourers, everyone puts out a fruit/vegetable cart, momos stall and so on. Also for seasonal businesses. Can't do anything to earn money. Much needed, the people of this country don't take anything seriously if not forced. What about ecommerce services and the internet?

Ecommerce will single handedly reduce the load and stress on all the grocery stores and medical shops out there.

It will also SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE an insane amount of people from gathering together and also help them live peacefully inside of their homes knowing fully well that people can deliver them essential goods.

Another thing is the internet. The entire IT industry is dependent on this.

Refusing these classes of workers who are majorly contributing to this country's infrastructure is an absolute must. What about daily wage workers ? What about EMIs, rent and interest payments ? I am fucking scared! I stay away from my native. in fact 800kms. i stay with 3 more people but thought that everything will be closed just makes me feel sick already. Cant go out. 

&#x200B;

Can we still buy food/grocery etc from tomorrow?  I just stepped out to buy some fruits and saw long queue at all the open shops. Cant blame people if they're hoarding either since this is more of a fight or flight response. We have enough aata. We still going out to get some, in case someone in our extended circle needs in emergency. I like this initiative, it was necessary. However what hated like was there was no clarity over whether groceries/pharmacies will be open. The exemptions for lockdown will be same as an the day of janata curfew. 21 days to develop a habit #Don't forget about your pets!!

If you are stocking up on food for yourself then your dogs/cats/pets neeed food too!! Get pedigree/cat-food/pet supplies and their medicines too! Don't forget them!! What happens to dabbawalas? Will meal delivery services continue? should have done this since 15 but okay not too late yet Good to know I've got three books left to read. Nice little vacation to get over the backlog. Good decision and glad he talked in layman's language. Hope people understand the 21 years setback thing and take this seriously now. Minsitry of Home Affairs issued a guideline for essential services

[https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1242476674710560770?s=20](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1242476674710560770?s=20) Does this mean ALL offices that do not come under essential services will be forced to close? Or does it still depend on the office and their owners to decide?

Also does insurance companies come under essential services? [Lockdown Guidelines](https://imgur.com/a/Oy4ZN50), what's open and what's not. After last times 8pm taali bajao scene, I thought this time would be something similar. But damn! I was wrong. >cigarette shops will be closed

Oh fuck me. It's sad that even after this people still roam the streets Bhai maggi milegi ki nahi? people in my neigbourhood are partying. i cant even Hey guys my mom is in India right now. Her flight to come back was the 30th. Do you think she will have to wait out the lockdown? The prime minister is holding a Q&A session live right now. 50% salary cuts in my company. Don’t know how I’m gonna survive the next month. Modiji listening to experts. Much love. WTF, Not even one line about essential services like vegetables, grocery? What to do? How are people who live off of daily wages supposed to survive? Pay rent? Everyone is supposed to dip into their savings but there are people who don’t have any.

Edit: i think this is the right time for Rahul Gandhi to preach about his NYAY scheme on tv (basic income for the poor) so it picks up steam. Many countries are doing the basic income thing. He should have taken questions from journalists like every other democratically elected leader is doing. My maasi's neighbor started crying after hearing his speech today. This is the kind of followers this guy has, he just needs to put it to good use. Good. But khayenge kya? thank god no more clapping n thali banging को - कोई

रो - रोड पे

ना - ना निकले i really want to know how tf am i gonna get food? if  there is a 21 days lockdown guys I live in Gurgaon and I  have parents in Agra who are alone, I really want to be with them  any way I can drive from Gurgaon to Agra during the lockdown? Time to shed the corona news and just chill, work and do some exercise. There is so much news coming from all the directions that it's overwhelming. Let's just take a step back and reflect on life, spend some time with families and hope this passes soon. The panic buying itself will result in a explosive burst of this virus.

People!! Chill the F out. Can we move from one place to another by foot as I'm fucked if I can't. Can any lawyer explain if this ""lockdown"" has any legal basis? As in, under central law. Or do the states and territories need to give it a legal basis? Mujhe koi bata sakta hai how do i pay my EMIs and credit card bills which ends up to 1lac per month.
If business are closed how do one earn that much money i am scared if this lockdown extends fir kya hoga banks will be go crazy. 2 speeches imploring people for self isolation and social distancing. Both resulting in hordes of people coming out on the streets to do the exact opposite. Incredible oratory, incredible communication. As a Pakistani, good move by your PM. Hopefully medicinal supplies and food gets delivered to those most in need This was what we needed. People need to respect the guidelines and stop with all the panic. 21 days. Lets pray for India. If you guys have listened to the announcement he says to stay at home ..and then says essential services will be working. Now how the hell should i stay at home and buy essential goods? Crowd toh udhar bhi hoga na ? Modi announced a 21 day lockdown. Did he announce a plan to take care of daily wage earners? No.

This was much needed. Concerned for medicine / Grocery but im sure the planners arent that stupid and accounted for it.

&#x200B;

Stay indoor Nibbas, EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE Anyone know what's happening with international flights? Messed up announcement. Who announces curfew from midnight to cause much chaos and shit. I hate Modi Ultimatums. His ""Mujhe 30 din dijiye"" spelled disaster to the economy. 

I am giving him 21 days, I will follow all the guidelines for the sake of myself and my family but I just dont trust him anymore. To those panicking, this was just step 1. I'm sure more clarifications will come over the next few days. He has already stated that essential services will remain open and they have allocated 15000 crores to improve our medical infrastructure. 

We're a democracy of over a billion people and no one in Modi's or our generation has ever faced something like this before. Every decision needs to be taken carefully. And so far this government has done everything right. They just showed that when push comes to shove, they can get their act together. 

I'm going to remain optimistic and say we're in safe hands for now. They have done their part, now it's out turn to do ours. When it wad time to prepare, Modi ji was welcoming Trump. Health Minister was saying Situation Under Control.

Lavda mera under control GHARO ME PYAAR BADEGA A good step. Hoping the tests are carried out widely too which is not happening as of now and hence the cases are low in our country. It's probably the one of the few times I appreciate the man's sensibility of the issue. 
I really hope everyone stays home. 

**PLEASE GHAR PE BAITHO**

**PLEASE SIT AT HOME**

**कृपया घर के अंदर बैठे रहें** It's a tough decision but maybe a strong one. Also some insight on how people are going to get essentials is important, hope the state govts come up with this too. Govt should arrange home delivery for groceries and cooked food from restaurants for maximum effectiveness. Govt can hire the daily wagers currently jobless due to lockdown for this purpose. dont think this is the right moment to ask this but, can anyone with experience tell me if booze and cigarettes will be available. The planet smiles :) This cascaded fast! From voluntary stay at home to curfew. Should have done a better job of pacing so people could stock up on essentials. I m already running out of food from 2 days of staying home. If I have to choose between starvation and corona, bring on the corona. Finally. Kudos to the government for taking the right step! Here is hoping we come out stronger on the other side Conspiracy theory

Modi will call off lockdown in two weeks. And then say “woah - see I stopped this” I appreciate this move very much, though I'm anti-BJP go corona, go corona. corona go! corona  go! go corona, go corona. Its interesting that the post about the 21 day curfew on r/news has been locked. There are some retarded comments (from both Indians and non Indians) so I guess that's justified They can't monitor every single street, ally, and building across India. Large groups will still gather. And if they get caught, the cops will be paid off. Plus.... where do all the homeless go? I've nothing to eat at home. I didn't hoard or i did panic buying and i'm the one put at disadvantage now. Seriously, He always does this gallery exhibition without any preparation or clarity. Ok, serious question: Why should I NOT start hoarding rice/wheat/oil/dal like crazy from today?

Not that I'm gonna do that but people I know will have to be reasoned with. And please don't say""fo it for others etc"" nobody gives a shit about others now. lets start #21daysreadingchallenge Ram Navami will be silent. The chaitra navratri will be joyless.  
We misused his name. We did evil in his name. We profited from his name.  
-This is his curse. The gods are angry.  
-We were chanting Jai Shri Ram like a mob slogan.  
-We should have been preparing for the healthcare emergency.  
-Instead, we were throwing stones and hate on the streets.  
We should have been united in the fight against his virus.  
Instead we were taking Lord Ram's name in anger.  
And pitting brother against brother on the streets.  
        
Lord Ram is angry. This is his curse. We must heed this. I'm shocked he never said a thing about how Essential supplies like Grocery and Milk and all that will be provided for the entire duration of the lockdown.

A simple 'We are looking into it' is simply not enough. I ordered an XS Max during clearance sale from Amazon. Anyone knows what happens to that? Not shipped yet. [removed] ELI5 how the lockdown is going to be effective if you are going to let people come out everyday to buy food? Too little, too late, too incompetent.

 In a country where close to 20 crore people go to sleep hungry everyday, the government shows exceptional faith in the ability of the common man to procure 21 days worth of ration in 4 hours. 

This nostalgia inducing move is enough to make people think about who are these “saathis” that the Prime Minister keeps on talking about. Is she the woman that was asked to vacate due to her hostel being turned into an emergency ward? Is he the man that was beaten up by on the way to get milk and then paraded on the media for the same?  Or is she the doctor, and also a mother of 2, who was harassed so much by the police that  she was forced to eat lunch in her ward even though her home was a five minute drive away. All of these three are people that I personally know, but may soon become a mould into which your near and dear may fall into, in the next three weeks.

It is perhaps futile to comment or criticise anything because all constructive opinions are these days seen as sedition and anti-establishment, when presented to anyone capable of turning things around. Even the media has turned into a repetitive show of a lover showering praises on his beloved, who can do and say no wrong. 

We’re already behind, and I must plead everyone reading this to proactively getting tested. Every plea and recommendation by the government is coming a week late, and as the educated populace we should be looking to take steps before they become do or die situations. It will be inconvenient, but the moment it is possible, please get yourself tested. Assuming of course, that we don’t have the same deficit of testing machinery as we do now. 

I do have the following questions, and it’ll be indebted to anyone who can answer them

1. What steps have been taken to ensure there is not blacket marketing and profiteering
2. Why is there a need for a separate “Corona War Chest”? How much of it will be funded using the money that would normally be used to run services like the railways? What part of it will have to be a bill that the common man will foot. 
3. Would valuable guidance on how to procure groceries in these trying times have taken too much air time? 
4. How do the authorities plan to differentiate between law breakers and people who are as desperate to get back home as they are to stay out?
5. Will I also be beaten up, made to wear placards, and my photo circulated on various platforms if I go to fetch groceries while both my parents are on duty? 

I write this not in my capacity as a dissenter or a critic. I’m writing this, standing in the shoes of someone who has both his guardians in the medical service. An incredibly small yet significant population which, if you haven't already guessed is incredibly stressed and at-risk. The same population who when, or if, this ends will need a regimen of drugs twice as long as compared to symptomatic patients. 

And for anyone who needs to read this : Just because you have a badge doesn’t mean you can treat people any way you like, and as a law enforcement ~~officer~~ personnel, you have an obligation to be more ethically upstanding than the average man, not less.

There is already lockdown in 95% of india what he should do is increase this to 100% by speaking to respective heads of the states.
I'm NOT against LOCKDOWN but a little bit angry about the panic created after his speech.
#stayhome. 21 days. Let's see. Am working more from home than i work from office. Wtf! I'm stuck in my hostel all alone till April 14th.
I should've gone home. For India's sake, I'm hoping this virus cannot survive higher temperatures, because along with social distancing, that would be quite useful in stopping the spread.

Because India can't afford a longer shutdown and certainly can't afford an uncontrolled pandemic. 😂 Anybody know what's going on with the exams?? Jee and stuff like that Is there any support going out for people who sustain entire families on daily wages and have lost their source of income? Will colleges reopen after the 21 day lockdown? My train is on 2nd April. So this lockdown means I have to cancel it? While I don’t agree with many policies of the Modi govt , the way Indian govt and the  bureaucracy has handled the corona pandemic has been remarkable. They learned lesson from other countries’ mistakes and acted swiftly. If coronavirus were to reach stage 3,there would be no way back for India Let's forget about all other issues and let's come together to beat this epidemic. As Modi said, Jaan hai toh jahaan hai. Follow social distancing friends and this too shall pass. Gobi: Damn I was itching to say something like this again after demo I called it first!

Oh wait, but they didn’t had internet. My bad. Good emphasis on all the right points. Finally an on-point message and very well done! This is better than the shitty bang vessels messaging that we had last time. Turn off the internet and all communication and public transportation and make a curfew so people can get a taste of how Modi  attacked Kashmir.

More people will die than due to the virus but Modi will consolidate power because ""he did something"". I hope to god I'm wrong. [deleted] Fucking eh!
Great job India!
Way to show solid leadership. Their is no plan. Remember demonitisation. He changed conditions willy-nilly,without a whit of care who got caught in crossfire. He played emotions of people,projecting so many dreams. The poor and middle class paid the price for his maniacal whims. The rich and truly corrupt coasted away with ease. It's happening again. The idiots are again falling for his passionate family member act.




This 21 days are going to be death knoll for small business,daily wage earners etc. And I don't trust shit about their arrangements. The social media is already rife with post praising cops for bashing people without even asking them why they are outside. I saw news report yesterday in which cops thrashed a fruit stall owner like beast for opening his kiosk. No education no dialogue, just beatings. This is the plan. The poor when forced out due to needs will be tagged by goons wearing facade of vigilance. 





Why are these affluent culprit who truly brought the virus to country going to decide what is essential and what's not? Is it safe to have a quick run on the streets early in the morning? I live in a sparsely populated area and people only start coming out around 7. Fucking idiot. That's not how you should do lockdown announcement. People panicking, overcrowded markets, everything could have been avoided if he had given more buffer time. I don't even have cigarettes ffs [deleted] Bhenchod sutte laane padenge. This is a mendatory step to be taken by the Government. Italy is in the 2nd position in terms of medical facilities and India far behind from them. After seeing Italy's condition, We should support our PM and we just need to be at home for our safety only. If you love your and your family's lives, Please stay at home! We need to fight this battle together. Good luck with this. Have you been to India?  Social distancing is impossible! Make sure to explain to all friends and relatives what social distancing actually means. In the UK, this being a new and conceptual phrase, it hasn’t really landed. Explain it in basic, relatable terms. Only going out for essentials, at most once a week. One form of exercise a day, either alone or with people you share a house with. 

Social distancing is a new concept and while people are hearing it and reading it, a lot of people are not really internalising it. At last they have taken right action. I’m dying of boredom So far so good! Announcing a Lockdown shows leadership but the real test is managing skills. 21 days of managing law and order, the supply chain of necessary products and services in the light of the crashing economy and daily earners having no way to earn and feed, it will be a real testing time for India and Modi. We support the lockdown. It's for our betterment to stay safe and live healthy life. This is a test of human capacity and capability to do what’s right. Mister Changa si Do Lobe 8 p.m. #Take the pooo to the looo 🎵🎵 1.3 billion Indians on lockdown. Guess what they're gonna be doing.

Yup. Reproducing. It's what Indians do best. Think of all that time freed up for unholy amounts of unprotected genital bashing. Expect maternity wards to be overwhelmed in 40 weeks. I am filled with so much rage at the moment. Does that mean there’s to be no change to activities in Kashmir? So all the liquor shops will be closed for three weeks? What about alcoholics who could actually die from withdrawals? India is literally the last place I think will take a lockdown seriously. Hygiene there is extremely poor. >Italy and America have world-class facilities still they were not able to stop it from spreading.


I, as an Indian in America- HAHAHAHAHA. World class facilities. LOL
The morons here are worried about their net worth more than what happens to people. There's still not much going on at the federal level. Indian govt is handling this better. (Indian people probably aren't). Here neither are handling it better. [deleted] This is a good start.

1.  how food/necessities can be distributed to walled-up-people.
2.  Support for people who would lose income
3.  Tax relief to people & industries
4. Charges which would be put on people who do not follow the lockdown.

Maybe the heat or dryness interferes with their ability to infect, denaturing viral surface proteins necessary for invasion into host cells. (all conjecture obviously)


I am most fascinated by the jumping genes/McClintock story I don't understand? If I have Covid-19 inside me, and I cook food (obviously there is a chance that I will breath on the food somehow), can I not temporarily put some strain on the food, which once eaten can pass the virus. In that way, is food not a vector (even if temporary)?? If it can pass through surfaces an infected person has touched why not food?",2020-03-17 04:31:41

Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona. I hope I can get a definite answer out of this that I can carry around for the rest of my life.",olivawDaneel," >drinking warm water or hot water

This is a myth. we are warm blooded animal.(Homeostasis) 

>milk with turmeric

turmeric has anti microbial property .

>About gargling.

Gargling works on a simple phenomenon i.e plasmolysis but do remember to add salt..otherwise gargling is useless.

>Vit C

Yes its good for immunity. But regular and gradual intake of VIt C helps in enhancing immunity. My dad isn't letting me keep water in the fridge.

Fuck these stupid fucking retarded ass WhatsApp forwards If digesting mucous by gastric juices could cure covid-19, then mucolytics would have been the first line therapy...

Failing that, listen to the PM. This is not a time for home remedies.

(And this BS about cold foods is irritating. Common cold and influenza are caused by coronaviruses, which don’t give a s**t about what you’ve eaten. Dairy, though, can thicken your mucus which can cause problems when you have a cold.)

> There is no clarity on how many times Shah stole food from the canteen. Just spoke to a friend who works in the same office as this man.

TBH, it's hard to define the 'Indian' aspect in this. Everyone is relating to this 'Indian' in their own way. 


Consider it a placeholder.


Some replace it with cheap, some with thief, some as shallow. It's what they want to see, their biases.


It's not the act of stealing or getting fired, it's the act of doing something that goes against the common held belief (eg, why does a well paid guy have to steal?), that makes it Induan.

Now the part where we are gonna analyze all this stuff will be done from home, You take information from your friends and that way we will have a long chain. I just have a rough idea as of now, Will think about it in detail tomorrow.

Let me make one thing very clear, If you will interact with people you are not helping them, No need to donate to our government, They have sufficient funds. 

Stay at home. Don't stop paying the salary of household servants if they are not able to come. Don't make them come and work. If you don't tell them to stop, they will come and work. Boil rice and take it with Salt. See what is happening in Italy, we do not have any other option.

Milk based energy drinks like bournvita, boost are over *70% suga*r with no evidence to prove any health benefits. 

You **dont** need 2-3 glasses of milk every day. That falsehood was perpetuated by American dairy association as an advertising campaign. 

There is absolutely no reason to drink milk if you are lactose intolerant. Most people dont even know if they have lactose problems.


**EDIT: copy pasting my reply from below.**

My point was that milk ain't no daily essential or superfood for adults. I dont advocate for veganism.

Yup milk is a cheap source of nutrition for kids and I wont contest that but its worth noting that Kids don't have to drink milk. Its a good source of calcium, vitamin D & some amount of protein but other food sources provide these nutrients substantially.

Milk alone cannot fulfill daily requirements for either of those. Especially protein.

A glass of chocolate milk has more sugar & calories than Coke.

Imagine, this was going to be the year in which we were going to put ideas like autonomous cars, flying cars, space tourism, asteroid mining, hyper-looping etc in action. Now, we are rushing to the grocery stores and fighting over trivial things like paper to wipe our backs. 

There is a quote in the movie Interstellar:

*”We’ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that.
Or perhaps we’ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we’ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us”*

It almost feels like that our systems, our unity, our spirit, our patience and our human sensitivities are all getting tested at the same time. The Hope that there is another tomorrow keeps us all moving and fighting. 

It however goes without saying the C-scare has truly shown the fragility of our existence. We need to pause. We need to think what is truly important. We need to focus. It is time to rethink. We have not found another worlds. We have not found a way to escape yet.

Past pandemics have killed more humans in one wave, that coronavirus could ever kill in its entire duration. We have better quality of life and better immune system now, no longer susceptible to other diseases like measles, small pox etc. We'll fare much better.


And the struggle is right now to save as many as possible. Including the sick and elderly too.

I have heard from many Indian people that it tastes disgusting, but I wonder how it could be that much different from other dals? And weirdly enough, the more I hear how bad it is, the more I want to try it.

What does it tastes like? Does it deserve it's reputation?",Mochi_Madness," It tastes good. Not that bad. Personally, I like it well enough. I think it's something of a self-fulfilling prophecy where you're told it tastes disgusting in childhood (because of its reputation as poor-people food, sick-people food and, well, horse feed) and that ends up influencing your experience. Similar to broccoli in the west. I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious, but they smell like death.

On a serious note, [you can make a *Rasam* \(a stew/soup that is eaten with rice\), and a *Palya* \(a sauteed vegetable dish\) out of it.](http://foodandremedy.com/recipes/side-dishes/sprouted-horsegram-rasam/) These are quite tasty!

p.s. I know horse gram and moong beans are different things. Its bitter in taste, 
I always squeeze lemon and put some salt.

Where you at? You can buy online though. Horse-gram is a very healthy lentil. The taste is a bit bitter but it goes well with spiced rice. It makes a good porridge and all healthy food doesn't taste good isn't it? I really like it. My mom makes Dal with it with tamarind. I had to Google what horse gram is.

Even Instant Noodles for that matter. Yes they're easy to make but Sodium will suck the Oxygen out of you and in case of a lockdown you may or may not want to open windows for cross ventilation.

If everything goes to shit sticks, Get a small stove some utensils and basic ration like rice, wheat so on and so forth. 

Until then High Fibre Bisuits, Dairy Products ( Cheese Slices are really useful they have enough nutrific value not a lot but enough ),protien bars/chocolate bars with nuts, and may sound contradictory but lots of chips because the amount of free time you'll have something to munch on will help pass time and deal with anxiety if it pops up. Buy rice and daal salt and some pickle, if possible find a kettle. It'll take some time but I think you can make daal rice and eat it with pickle worst case scenario. Soak the rice and daal in water for like an hour to reduce the cooking time. Good luck bud r/eatcheapandhealthy Just some options.

Juice cartons, and longer lasting fruits like apples.   
And some ready-to-eat meals maybe- like MTR instant poha & Upma. They also have meals like sambar rice, chana masala, etc. which don't taste that great, tbh, but are a good contingency plan.   


Then your snacks like fibre biscuits, and maggi, cuppa noodles. Maybe some dark chocolate.

It's for us to decide what we want to eat , not others I am atheist, i eat whatever i want. **Rig Ved**

Mandal 10, Sukt 68

1-12 (or 3 to 12)

It talks about beef eating (both male and female, bull/cow). In special occasions or in rituals the female/the cow was slaughtered.

Beef eating was very common in ancient times, specially when a guest comes to your house. It was so common that some times *atithi* (guest) was instead referred as *'Gau-ghna'* means 'Killer of cow'.

Furthermore, lord indra was fan of oxen, he demanded 15-20 at a time so that both of his cheeks can be full. 

RSS/Hindutva != hinduism. Given the religious nature of food and association with cow in UP, I refuse to eat palak paneer in UP. You never know if it's palak. Your food is their mummy. /s Food itself is a religion and all humans love that. Bjp rats sell and eat beef themselves. Cow or Beef is only an excuse to lynch muslims. Period. That's not really true. Muslims and conservative Hindus do have taboos with respect to different kinds of foods. But it's mostly a private affair. We don't enforce our personal restrictions on others.

Also, lets not be too naive about this affair near Makara Sankranti or Amit Shah's [vaman jayanti](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/amit-shahs-vamana-jayanti-tweet-sparks-a-row-on-onam-eve/articleshow/54319937.cms?from=mdr) wishes on Onam. These are the kinds of third-rate spitting matches that India's internal discourse has come down to. Wish someone from Kerala was our PM. Words sir words 👌👌👌👌 Bhaisahab, yaha to dange ho jaate h aap ksi baat kr rhe ho.😂😂 Absolutely true. Many people across India enjoy beef and other meats as auspicious. The cowbangers oh so favourite Kashmiri pandits eat beef regularly. These cheapos who can't even sing the national song or name all the Vedas are out to use my religion as a stick to harass minorities Can confirm. It's quite common for Malayalee Hindus to eat beef.

Food,Theory : gujrati food has so many dry snacks because of their long distance travelling since ancient times,52,f5aarr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f5aarr/theory_gujrati_food_has_so_many_dry_snacks/,19,"Gujaratis have been involved in trade, buisness etc since a long time. From the indus Valley time's  lothal port to trading with Africa, gujratis often travelled long distances during their travels.

In order to survive these journeys, they made large variety of dry snacks which won't spoil easily. This is the reason why gujrati diet has so many dry snacks as its part",ParmanuMan," But, by that logic shouldn't odias also have dry snacks too..we were a seafaring people too with trade relations in the far East. Now this is just my theory, so take it with a pinch of salt. It's based on my mother and my grandmother's account of her childhood.

Basically, Gujarat is semi arid region and water deficient in most parts. Pulses generally grow in such areas where irrigation is lacking and rain is scarce. Back in the days, most people consumed what grows in the region. Groundnut was another crop. So you see the diet dominant in these pulses and groundnut. Oil used is also the same while much of North India used sarson.. (which is non existent in Gujarat, btw). White rice seems a recent entrant on the plate. Earlier it used to be mostly red rice. (My mom says that they had to queue up with the ration shop when they come to know that white rice has arrived.) Most elders in my family used to eat jowar till 90s (in South Gujarat). In Saurashtra, it would be bajra. Again, wheat rotis become popular only recently. (May be post 70s). 

My grandmother said that back in the days, they would get vegetables only during monsoon and winter. For most of the summer, they would only eat mangoes (which was in abundance in the season.) Sabji was just some pulses cooked into a curry like -dried chana, moong, besan etc. No green veggies for summer. So you see most of the gujju dishes have a base of pulses, because essentially that's what was available. 

Actually besan is a common ingredient across rajasthan, gujarat and Maharashtra - all historically water deficient states. The super fried snacks may be a recent addition. (I remember there were only 2-3 famous shops in my hometown in the 90s and most of the snack was bought and consumed garama-garam.. after 10 in the morning and 7 in the evening, you won't get anything...it's consumption may have increased with it being available in packets everywhere now.)  Also, they are not limited to Gujarat only. Even South has its variant of ""murukku"". The Gujarati or rather Central Indian snacks became more famous recently because of Haldiram maybe? Even the ""murmura"" snacks are common in much of India. 

But yes, we do like to carry our food along while traveling. Though that has to do with our ""save money for 1 meal"" tendency plus ""won't find vegetarian food"" problem. Don't think it has much to do with the seafarers. They probably had an abundance of macchi from the Arabian sea on their way to Africa. This is the state of affairs. The OP posted a theory based on Geopolitics about Food and in no way claimed any superiority but barring few all comments are bashing the OP or Gujaratis. 

About the theory, quite plausible. It is often the case that even today Gujaratis travel with their own food in trains etc. This is an indicative of a culture which carries food with them, and the day snacks such as Farsan (not just Gujarati) are quite nutritious and energy rich for journeys. 
But that's just my perspective, I am sure you will find some research about it.

If interested, by far the best Travel food I have found is HardTack or Ship Biscuit. It lasts years, museums have HardTack from the 1700s which is still edible. Plausible. I remember hearing something similar on Raja Rasoi show on Netflix. Don't know man. There are so many preservatives like salt, which would have been abundant in Gujarat. While it is highly plausible that dry foods would be the norm for sea faring traders, we don't see the same in the southern foods, who traded with Sri Lanka and Indonesia, and the eastern coast, who traded with the Chinese. It's possible, but not conclusive. One I heard about Rajasthan is that their food is spicy because it make people to drink more water than usual, given the extreme hot weather Gujjus and their Besan. It's the worst thing for nutrition values. No wonder the state has highest number of cases of under and malnutrition as compared to India. WHO always worries about that state's health and nutrition since decades. But why unhealthy snacks? Do they have sweet snacks because excessive travelling led them to make constant sources of energy?


man,people will boast about breathing air theses days. Isn't this like common knowledge? I mean I was fascinated when I first heard it but then I've heard it lot My theory: A gujrati in earlier times accidentally dropped besan (chick pea flour) in hot oil which lead to the invention of 90% of gujrati cuisine. /S Basically a gujju will take a natural progression of diet from lifestyle that is shared by many different communities all around the world and then take credit for it as if its unique to them.

makes sense. seeing the general attitude.

Food,A long read but definitely provides much food for thought! Would like to know your thoughts on this.,1,fsagi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsagi8/a_long_read_but_definitely_provides_much_food_for/,7,"A comprehensive summary and analysis by Jaideep Varma. 

""If you're one of those who cannot bear an alternative opinion, please don't burden your dainty mind further. But if you're fine with wading into a fresh perspective that has no pretensions of being the last word, some of you might just find this constructed case below worth your time. 

It seeks to examine if there has been an international overreaction to Coronavirus, entirely in synch with the polarised world this virus was born into. 

Let's proceed fact-by-fact. (All stats from the public domain; have aggregated to actually provide a conservative estimate. References in first comment). I've tried to simplify this as much as I can, for easy comprehension. 

1) 
The following are the fatality rates of Coronavirus in different age-groups: 

0-9 yrs - 0%; 10-19 yrs - 0.2%; 20-29 yrs - 0.2%; 
30-39 yrs - 0.2%; 40-49 yrs - 0.4%; 50-59 yrs - 1.4%; 
60-70 yrs - 3.8%; 70-79 yrs - 8%; 80+ yrs - 15%. 

So, even an infected person of over 80 years has an 85% chance of survival. It is important to understand that Coronavirus affects mostly people with pre-existing conditions, which is why the fatality rate really starts notably increasing from the age-group 50-59. 

(Also, the rumours about more men dying are true; the proportion is roughly 70:30. Given that this is a respiratory disease, this discrepancy has been linked to smoking by some experts, not to any specific targeting by the virus).

2) 
The following is the approximate outcome for infected people: 

95% infected people need 2 weeks to recover with no medicine, from home. 
5% need hospitalisation.
2% need ICU.
1% need ventilator.

So, the vast majority of infected people can just recover by staying at home, with no medicine. Even seemingly well-educated people don't seem to grasp this properly. Please hold on to this fact. 

The big concern for authorities is for a large number of cases to be in that 5% when there are fewer hospital beds available, and especially in that 1% where there is a considerable shortage of ventilators.  

3) 
In warmer countries, for some reason that is still not clear, the fatality rate is considerably lower than other places so far, and the overall fatality rate of about 4.5%. 

Brazil: 2.7%; Malaysia: 1.2%; Thailand: 0.4%; Saudi Arabia: 0.3%; India: 2.3%. (The two outliers are Indonesia and Philippines with 8.4% and 6.7% but experts have stated these figures have emerged due to very low testing in that part of the world; more testing would lower the fatality rates considerably). 

Low testing is a big problem in India as well. However, there are no reports of people with symptoms crowding hospitals as there are in many other countries. And it is important to understand that if there are indeed many latent cases as is feared, that would actually bring DOWN the fatality rate. 

Death tallies can't be faked and it is hard to hide the dead - that is the key number, and that is 20 over ten-odd days. Even with limited testing, the average number of new Indian cases is in the region of 100-120 a day; it has been like that for a week. Which means there is absolutely no evidence of exponential community spread till date in India. And that has so far been the case in all of the warm weather countries. 

4) 
In human history, untreated illnesses and unvaccinated viruses have the following as fatality rates: 

Rabies - 99%; AIDS 80-90%; EBOLA 87%; Smallpox - 65%; Bubonic/Pneumonic Plague 52%; Tetanus 50%; Cholera 47%; TB 43%; Chickenpox 30%; Typhoid 15%; SARS 11%; Spanish Flu 10%; Zika Virus 8%; Yellow Fever 7.5%; Diphtheria 7.5%; Coronavirus 4.5%; Measles 2.5%; Swine Flu 2.1%. 

So, Coronavirus has among the lowest fatality rates in history.

This is the first virus to travel so far (199 countries) in this new world, polarised more than ever before in human history by social media and mobile technology. A global virus in an intensely globalised world should not be a surprise at all, spreading during peak travel season, both, domestically in China and internationally. The virus itself is more contagious than most other viruses that came before, but not by such a great margin. 

There have been many pandemics in human history, many of them far, far worse than this one (in terms of fatalities). But the reaction worldwide has been fraught with anxiety and panic in the face of the uncertainty of having no cure yet. 

Incidentally, uncertainty is a condition that people in this new world (mobile social media) deal with far worse than any previous generation in history - this has been well documented and discussed in recent times. Has that had a greater say this time than the pandemic itself? 

5) 
WHO estimates deaths arising from common flu to be between 290,000 to 650,000 people every year, at a fatality rate of roughly 1%. Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 so far in about four months, with very limited testing in many parts of the world (truer testing would lower its 4.5% fatality rate considerably). 

Also, two recent studies done in Italy comprehensively show that ""less than 1% of the deceased were healthy persons, or persons without pre-existing chronic diseases."" Which means, in the face of so much focus on Coronavirus, it is not clear in many places ""who died FROM the Coronavirus and who died WITH the Coronavirus"". 

Incidentally, between the five winter seasons in Italy between 2013 and 2017, there were 68,000 deaths from common flu. That means an average of about 4,500 deaths a month during the winter season (where February is the peak month). This has very emphatically been a trend in the last decade in Italy anyway - of elderly people dying in droves from flu during the winter months. Does Italy's death toll of approximately 9,000 in three months due to Coronavirus seem high in light of this? Especially when the Italians themselves are not sure in many cases if the patients are dying of Coronavirus or merely with it. 

The US, who have just overtaken Italy on number of Coronavirus cases, have an even more sordid record when it comes to the common flu. In the 2017/28 flu season, the US registered 61,000 deaths from flu. That's an average of over 10,000 deaths a month! In the 2018/19 flu season, there were 34,200 deaths - that's 5,700 deaths a month. So far, there have been about 1500 deaths from Coronavirus in the US. 

It is worth repeating this - the Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 in four months, while an average of WHO's tally of common flu deaths every year is about 39,000 deaths PER MONTH and critically, within EXACTLY the same patient base. And recent studies in Italy have found that it is not entirely clear if many of the patients actually died from the Coronavirus. 

This is a huge point that will no doubt be explored in great depth by the medical fraternity in months to come. But it is worth thinking about this - what would happen if there was intense 24-hour media scrutiny worldwide on the common flu deaths - at the rate of about 39,000 a month worldwide ? What would it do to our minds? If we discount the absence of uncertainty (as common flu has prescribed cures, which is why the fatality rate is low) would it not lead to a similar brand of panic that we see now? (This disproportionate panic is apparent in the smallest things; like, despite WHO and the American Surgeon General categorically saying that masks are useless unless a person has definite symptoms, there has been a frenzy for them.) 

Obviously, this is not at all a case to downplay the Coronavirus pandemic. It has to be combatted, and the key ways are well-known by now - social distancing, regular hand-washing, quarantines, and closing down travel. A lockdown in places where there are signs of community spreading is definitely desirable. Even as a precaution, this is a good option, for a limited period.   

Beyond dispensations and politics, this is about worldwide frenzy and alarmism, accentuated by a mainstream media that comprehensively leans towards worst-case scenarios in the name of erring on the side of safety. And many people are unable to adjust their mind to the fact that those are worst-case scenarios and that ""experts"" in most fields do not even agree with each other, and so get stuck on pessimistic, and often outlandish views as the most credible one (which in turn gets perpetuated). It is a perfect pointer to our times how so many react violently to that singular view being questioned, and alternative views derisively dismissed without its facts examined at all. (This does make one wonder about climate-change alarmism as well. For example, it is worth remembering that before William Nordhaus won the Economics Nobel in 2018, climate change anti-alarmists were equated with climate deniers.) 

But here's the kicker. Why is it that the far higher death tallies of flu in recent years, in exactly the same patient group as that of Coronavirus, never got the kind of attention that the Coronavirus tallies have received? Could it have something to do with the largely modest economic and social classes getting affected by the common flu? And the travelling/ jet-setting classes of people who are affected by the Coronavirus? Couple this class consciousness (and the blatant sacrificing of the worker class in some countries, like India) with the fear mongering that the political class relies on to subjugate the masses, at a time when leadership standards all around the world are at an all-time low than ever before in human history, and we have a lethal combination. 

Yes, Coronavirus has changed the world but is it because of the pandemic itself or because of how all of us have responded to it?""",dennkiesauros," One point missed here is the problem of sudden surge in cases, overwhelming the medical system. Common flu happens at a level much below the usual medical system capability. When number of people needing medical attention and ventilator increase above the medical capacity, then the medical system ceases to exist for new patients. The real problem with Coronavirus isn't its spread or lethality, it is its spread relative to what the healthcare system can handle. 

UK gave similar argument as the above post in the beginning, with herd immunity and downplayed the risks giving similar arguments. But the Imperial College study showed that if unchecked, mortality would be very high. The guy who wrote this post is about 3 weeks late to the discussion which has evolved rapidly. 

Moreover, the number quoted above are only preliminary. Coronavirus isn't over yet. I didn't read the whole thing through, so pardon me if I misunderstood it but there are some ground realities that's being ignored.

First, flu doesn't affect the whole population in a short period of time. Its infection is spread out in a longer period of time so that it doesn't overwhelmed healthcare facilities. So those infected can get proper treatment. It's also less lethal and less contagious.

Second, anybody could fall sick or get into a situation that requires medical help but wouldn't be able to because hospitals are filled with Covid-19 patients. And this would increase deaths from other causes. Pregnant mothers too aren't able to get medical assistance as a result.

Third, we don't yet know the long term implications of Covid-19. Death isn't the only thing that we should be concern about a disease. Will any tissues or organs be impaired permanently? Do those who recovered become fully fit and healthy? I am sorry but this is just bullshit. Is it a threat to humanity? No But to accept death rate 2-3% in 21st century is not acceptable. Tldr ? > 95% infected people need 2 weeks to recover with no medicine, from home. 5% need hospitalisation. 2% need ICU. 1% need ventilator.

What it does signify is the stark contrast of realities between the middle/upper classes of society and the lower strata. There's a differential treatment meted out to the people from different classes.. for example, none of us would be subjected to chemical treatment the way poor were treated in UP. While the upper classes get airlifted from different countries, the poor have to walk hundreds of kilometres and even die on road.. no, it doesn't mean that we need to feel guilty about our privilege rather that we need to accept the reality and see how best we can bridge this gap of unequal treatment. That's it.

No one chooses to be born in either poor or affluent families. It's a lottery of birth. It's about how best as a soceity we can provide the same opportunities to build their own lives and how empathetically we do it. Ok, I am gonna ask it already: what exactly do you want us to do? Tell me. We can't feel annoyed, embarrassed, bored, confused, hungry, thirsty, pain, anything because 'somebody is out there who is facing more trouble than us'. So, what exactly do you want me or us to do in this lockdown? Should we launch a guerrilla warfare against Modi or something? No, just tell us directly, what do you guys want us to do in this lockdown? This post is ridiculous lol But aren't we social distancing so the poor don't have to? /s Wow their is a new trend these days to shame people in the name of privilege. Like wtf you want me to do?! If we go out then we are tagged as ""irresponsible citizen"" and if we don't we are considered ""privilege brats"". Like for the ffs stop being such an hypocrite. They are doing what they have to and we are doing what we have to. Everyone's situation is different and you have to admit that. Smh I understand this but what am I supposed to do with this guilt and shaming? Ffs what are we supposed to do then? /r/lookatmeimsuchadeepperson how dare us people who have a safe and secure accomodation during this lockdown not feel guilty and sorry for the poor every moment we breathe?

let's all leave our houses this instant and drive them to their homes hundred of kms away, or better yet donate thousands of ₹₹₹ to PM-CARES so that they are treated, locked up and disinfected. 

us having money has stripped us of our right to enjoy our own lives, having materialistic desires and feeling cooped up in our apartments. we should always think of those who have it worse than us and never of ourselves. It’s sad that they believe going home is gonna solve their problems, they’re just gonna spread it to rural villages where healthcare isn’t readily accessible. 112% of randians are that guy Indeed, We have a casual approach towards everything when we are supposed to save our life knowing that there is a serious thing out there, but we still want to act stupid, I know a bunch of people who have this urge to go out and see what's happening around as they feel trapped inside, I mean common you are educated enough to understand the meaning of lockdown and why is it imposed.   
\#Peoplestaysafe. Can we instead start calling the lower income groups underprivileged rather than calling middle class Privilaged? Irresponsible chief ministers of the states not taking responsibility of their people. Suggest the solution also. It is easy to complaint and feel sorry for others  but I see no other alternative. Lockdown ( which is complete curfew in my state-Punjab) is killing economy , but what other alternative do we have . Virtue signalling bullshit !! Maulana saad : Anyway so i started banging So this is showing the difference in situation of people where were lucky enough to be already in their homes, when the lock down started, *VS* ones who were away from home for some reason, and couldn't get back home. because of lock down

Not a poor vs rich thing. Did I get that right? Wait a min, what does ""privilege"" has to do with that? This targets the wrong audience. Most of us have earned our privilege. 
This is supposed to target elected politicians, policy makers and government officials who boast to be in 2nd, 3rd and sometimes 4th term in the office or servants working for 10,20+ years and still haven't resolved this during their tenure. It's on them. 
Poor guys, can't even donate even if they want to. The PM care fund accepts only white money. 🤦🏻‍♂️ The social privilege is ""birth control"" Privilege\*\*

Typo in the title The social distance has always been there in a country like india. It has not magically appeared now. OR people haven't realised it suddenly. Its a reality pre-corona. It will be a reality post-corona. Dont assume we are all lacking empathy. So true. Understanding privilege in situations, is sometimes a privilege.  Did you say you’re ‘dying to go out’? Well, the poor are actually dying...to go home.

Food,"Movie-goers can carry their own food, water bottles to theatres, reveals RTI query",821,e87w4z,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/movie-goers-can-carry-their-own-food-water-bottles-theatres-reveals-rti-query-113719,75,,shashank1706," [deleted] wait a second, so when the theatre stops me from letting me get inside with a water bottle, I'll have to say that the RTI says something else? Maybe the theatres shouldn't let people carry food inside theatres but what's wrong with water? Yes! Now I can sing the national anthem while standing and eating my malai kofta! Lunch boxes in theatres are a bit too much don't you think. \>Responding to the RTI query filed by Hyderabad-based anti-corruption activist Vijay Gopal, the police have clarified there are no curbs by law to carry food and water, and a complaint can be filed with the Legal Metrology Department who will check if there are any violation of law

&#x200B;

Sensationalised article...  if there is no restriction by law, then a complaint can be filed with a department who will check if there is any violation of the law. That does not mean that a theater cannot ban food from being taken into the premises unless

1) There is an explicit law which requires the theater to allow food in the hall

OR

2) There is no policy of the theater against bringing food in and its just the security guards enforcing it on verbal orders

(I believe an explicit law does exist requiring free water to be provided, but nothing for food) 

&#x200B;

After all, there is no restriction by law on an 80 year old guy going to a club wearing just shorts and bathroom slippers, but the club can enforce their own policies. Careful, to my knowledge this a state subject and what applies in Telangana/AP does not necessarily apply to your state. Make sure you are familiar with the regulations prevailing in your jurisdiction. I don't like people eating in cinema halls first of all, it's really distracting movie watching experience for me, can't they just wait for two and half hours without eating and the guy who serve's them roaming around finding for people who ordered, I want it to end and people using phones Fuck this, in Netherlands they allow you to get your own beer and food.
Here snacks in supermarket is comparatively 20% less expensive than in cinemas, where as in India its 200% fucking more expensive in cinema. Fuck u pvr n fun cinema
Now u see my wraith and destruction Not being a crime doesn't mean it's automatically allowed. Private venues are free to bar moviegoers from bringing stuff in.

From what i understand there's a specific state law in Telangana (and possibly AP as well) that prohibits movie theatres from making these restrictions but that doesn't mean you can pull this shit anywhere in the country. If you do, the theatre is free to tell you that you're not allowed in. End of story Just snack before the movie Basically - it's not illegal to carry your shit a theater, BUT a movie theater is a private business and it can enforce rules on you, even as a paying customer (as long as it's not discriminatory).

Stupid sensationalist headline. Brace yourselves for Stinky movie theaters Its not a hospital or school, if you do not like the pricing just do not go to the movies why is cheap food and drink at the movies supposed to be for public good. Nobody is forcing anyone to go watch movies and then buy their pricey offerings, if there is a market for their offerings at their prices why should they reduce the prices or allow outside food and drink. I don't mind buying shit from cinema canteen but their food isn't great and charging more than standard price is what pisses me off.",2019-12-09 17:42:06

Swiggy and Zomato are giving opportunities if you can drive  and have a  two wheeler. 

But  If you are  on your own ,  people may take advantage of your situation. Think it through. 

17 is not an age for harsh decisions . Try for employment. If not then work on other students projects. Freelance for companies with your skills. Lastly teach others for fees. You'll have to figure which works in only suggesting different ways. Move to a college that has its own hostel and stay there. My uni/college had TA'ship opportunities from 3rd year onwards (IIIT-H). My parents paid for the first two years of my education. 

From 3rd year onwards, they paid only the tuition. My TA money covered the rest. For my master's, I paid nothing. Instead I got paid by my college. I also wrote software on small contracts in various labs at the institute and it paid me well.

I chipped in afterwards by paying for my brother's education. So I don't owe my parents anything. Depending on your school/college timings and your willpower you can opt for part time jobs or work in BPOs.

There is always the option to become a content writer but those aren't that well paying and you will need someone's help to start it off a bit well.",2020-03-15 01:52:09
Food,Does cooking destroy coronavirus? Also can it be contracted through outside food?,5,fhjlm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fhjlm1/does_cooking_destroy_coronavirus_also_can_it_be/,3,Can I get coronavirus from street food? Do I need to worry about getting it  from not cooking my food properly?,ParmanuMan," You can get many infections from street food or uncooked food, not just Corona. Avoid eating out unless it's piping hot food and always cook your meals thoroughly, especially meat. SARS and MERS viruses (same family of coronavirus) are known to be destroyed by cooking/heat. So I suppose the same would be applicable for COVID-19.

Many guidelines also clear this in their FAQs on COVID-19.

As a practice, if you have a cook making the food, ask them to wash their hands thoroughly with soap before they cook. According to [the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51735367):

> Outside the body, ""to actively kill the virus you need temperatures of around 60 degrees  Celsius"", says Professor Bloomfield - far hotter than any bath.

> Washing bed linen or towels at 60C is a good idea, as this can kill any viruses in the fabric. But it's not a good option for washing your skin.

Also [this story from China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/16/WS5e487f34a310128217277d2b.html):

> The novel coronavirus can be killed in water at 56 C or higher after 30 minutes

So food cooked in hot temperatures for a while  should in theory be safe? In any case, no one is pointing at hot food as a source of infection.

Update: found a [scientific paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14631830/) about temperature and coronaviruses, although this is from 2003:

> Viruses stayed stable at 4 degrees C, at room temperature (20 degrees C) and at 37 degrees C for at least 2 h without remarkable change in the infectious ability in cells, but were **converted to be non-infectious after 90-, 60- and 30-min exposure at 56 degrees C, at 67 degrees C and at 75 degrees C, respectively**. Irradiation of UV for 60 min on the virus in culture medium resulted in the destruction of viral infectivity at an undetectable level.

Also, for cleaning potentially infected surfaces — soap (alternatively sufficiently strong alcohol, although soap is better) is highly effective in [physically destroying the Coronavirus](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1236549305189597189.html) as soap and alcohol both destroy the virus’s lipid membrane.",2020-03-13 01:02:40

I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government:

This is a shitty situation, but hopefully enough spotlight will force them to rectify it. Good luck. Few days ago i created a post where i complained about the situation in Punjab, specifically my district in Jalandhar. 

It looks like it took them three days but they have proved me wrong. They have developed a very efficient system that others can learn from.

&#x200B;

* No shops are being allowed to open.
* Authorities have compiled a list of contacts of grocers, chemists, vegetable sellers, etc and distributed via social media.
* Garbage collectors back to work after 3 days. 
* Vegetable vendors are servicing inner areas, this is being ensured by issuing passes to people with hand carts and bikes trailers.
* Scrap dealers, other factories with bike trailers requested to instruct their workers to work in fresh food selling. Passes facilitated. 
* MC have roped in volunteers and setup a hotline number to coordinate delivery of essentials to the door. 
* MC volunteers arrived to the door to inform of  these arrangements. They said they wanted to make sure old people who are not tech savvy are not left out.
* Mayor going live every day asking for suggestions from locals and implementing them. 

Today only I managed to buy vegetables, fruits and grocery from the comfort of my home. Makes things much more less stressful. I am failing to understand the mentality of the government and police in doing this. What are they thinking? Are they thinking at all? Are they robots who do not realize that humans need to eat? 

Please tweet and share, we will amplify. My friend (British national) is currently stranded in Goa and has been unable to buy any food for several days. When she tried to move accommodation due to the guesthouse shutting down, she was beaten violently with sticks by the Goan police. I checked which party is in power in Goa. Holy Shit! What type of government are they running? CM of Bjp, 2 deputy CMs from 2 other parties, fking 2 independent ministers. 

Do share Twitter links etc so that we can try to highlight this. Tweeted about this to Faye D'Souza. Hope she takes this up. My friend is stuck in Goa with barely enough food to last through this weekend. I'm beyond anxious for her and just want her back in Sweden. Tweet this at foreign news outlets as well as Indian. They've given permission for shops to be open 24/7 from tomorrow This is a terrible decision by the Goa state government. Once this is verified, lets start tweeting to the centre, HMO and Goa state officials from CM to Governor to anyone your can think of that can make a change. Indian authorities will kill more people than the Coronavirus in India. After a long time, we might see deaths from starvation. Fellow Goan here, this is true. Not sure how the people will react if they open it now. I really thought our state being small it would be easy to manage for them. But our government has screwed this up big time. Stories like make me so grateful to live in Mumbai

For years, I complained about the traffic, pollution, population, etc

But when it comes to disasters like this, our government infrastructure is top notch. 

(Thanks to all celebrities and Ambani living here, governments make sure Mumbai is always taken care of)

Grocery Shops, Vegetable Markets, Milkman, Garbage Collection, Banks are all open.
And the cops in my area atleast are very compassionate.

Hope you make it out bro. elect a clown, expect a circus.

also, once a clown gets elected, elections become a joke. Tweet and share the link with us. Yes! My brother is a PG student at Goa medical college and he starved himself for the past 2 days! All he had was milk in that tiny room of his. Until one of his friends found out and brought him roti and curry. Please check out for your friends and acquaintances everyone! What the fuck were we doing when the situation was getting serious two months back.

All we had to do was monitor the foreign returnees properly and better, stopped all incoming flights and discouraged non essential foreign travel for a month or so, and enforced quarantines in a strict manner, instead we had the nonsense called nameste trump, and the govt even had time and energy to topple a state government ( madya pradesh) and now after the horse has bolted, modiji comes around giving a verbose speech appealing to the lowest common denominator, with zero planning and haphazard and shoddy implementation, and suddenly we have everybody singing his praise. 

Like what the hell is wrong with Indians, we seem to reward incompetence irrationally and it doesn’t even make sense anymore. Where in Goa are you? Grocery stores are opening in the morning in siolim. For a couple hours only but they do open. Also fresh fish is available but you might have to wait 15-20 minutes for the fresh catch to come in. And i was wondering why there is still 0 cases in Goa till date..... We need Kejriwal in Mumbai as well,

OP, you may want to share to r/coronavirus once verified to improve visibility on the situation. Goa doesn't have enough testing kits yet, maybe it's a sure-shot way of keeping people inside.   


I'm not supporting what the goa government did/are doing.   


But after seeing the way the public came out in other states...the markets were kept open and people rushed out in large numbers to by groceries...coming in close proximity with each other...increasing the chances of spreading the virus.   


Just to get the msg out - as of tomorrow - 27th March 2020 - the Goa Govt has now allowed all individual grocery, vegetable & milk stores to open from tomorrow. Tweet to ndtv/the hindu Jesus fuck. Although I can't sympathize, I am Goan. I know that if you in village your neighbours can be helpful as these communities are small and dependant on each other.

Please try to convince your neighbours to share some food. 

The body can go without food for weeks but you need to have a fresh source of water. Make sure you always have water with you.

Did like to know your location, if possible. While I don't stay in Goa, my family stays in Margao, Aquem. I like modi's decision at fist but now I realize the shortcomings. Why the hell did he not coordinate with all the states and made a plan before announcing it to the public? Why must everything be so dramatic? Does Goa has any case of covid 19? I was curious there is no news? Ye CM toh same to same apne kejriwal sir jaisa hi dikhta hai in the photo at the top of your post well like the thali support was for appreciating service workers, make a note of using ""calender khana do, thali banging at lunch and dinner"" for all families unable to get food and basic living items, it should work as a good metric of measurement of people who are hungry as long as the hungry ones only bang the utensils They're gonna open again from 27th march.

After creating this needless panic in people by depriving them for almost a week, now he has agreed to open the shops. But apparently supermarkets are being closed down by the police! Only small shops given permission, and they don't have any stock!!!! Because the trucks with supplies are waiting at Goa borders, which apparently haven't been opened yet. My god this is unbelievable. I am absolutely FUCKING LIVID.  A sensible option would just to get government police officers to deliver food to addresses.  Instead, they just beat people on motorcycles for shopping for FOOD.  FUCKING FOOD.

People in Wuhan are being fucking WELDED in their homes.  Are they getting food??  If they are, at least authorities would be delivering food to them.  At least the Chinese government would have thought of that.

And what the fuck is the Indian government doing??  Starving them.  I'm in fucking tears. Suddenly living in bihar doesn't seems as bad Where are the retards that kept saying don't hoard. This is absolutely fake.
Everyday at 5AM my local grocery is open until 6AM.
Milk and other necessities are being distributed every hour. If you cannot access it, doesn't mean that others cannot. 
The CM had urged everyone to stock up many a times.
Secondly, majority of people who cannot access food are from other states, they too were given prior updates to leave for their villages and towns.

--edit--
FYI, there are many services available. You just need to search them.
If you can't even do that much ig u should prolly starve. comment for visibility. Commenting for visibility. This is such a overreaction. I live in Assagao and we too have had stores open for sometime in the morning to distribute essential stuff. Instead of bickering here on reddit make some efforts to locate the services. Ask your neighbors or call the Goa governments food helpline on 9423890066 if ur literally starving. But why kejrivaal's pic? The shops will be open. Don't need to panic.

We went there and ordered immediately. They had a relatively small/decent menu but most of the things were not available. We ordered Panner Bhurji and Chicken Keema. 
It took 30-35 minutes before the sabzis arrived and then further 4-5 minutes for rotis. 
The chicken had so much black pepper, you could not even taste the chicken. Then we tried Paneer and it was now lemon instead of pepper (Or maybe Panner had turned foul). It was awful.",Proud_Dalit,,2020-04-05 00:34:54
Food,"Randians who can’t tolerate spicy food, how do you manage living outside?",28,et4tez,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/et4tez/randians_who_cant_tolerate_spicy_food_how_do_you/,28,"No one in my family has decent spice tolerance. How do I explain it, not only I feel burning sensation in my mouth and chest but it also feels uncomfortable after eating & I have a hard time digesting it. Maybe it’s because of genetics. By spice I don’t mean just chilli but other spices too.

Back in home, all things are cooked without spices. Wedding ceremonies become a nightmare sometimes. Fortunately, I’ve a sweet tooth to make up for it and enjoy sweet things in general. 

After 12th I moved out and went to Kota for medical preparation. And food in my hostel was absolute nightmare (but average according to others), I suffered from acidity & sickness the entire year. Situation didn’t improve all even in my college life with the limited things I can eat. Also, I can’t eat outside with the few friends I have, unless it’s McDonald’s or KFC, which is rare since most of time they hang out, they always prefer dinner at some restaurant instead. Eating just Hakka noodles & salad isn’t worth it.

Edit: *I’ve read that our taste buds and nerves use various proteins (called TRP channels) to detect various substances that give most spices their distinctive taste. Most of these proteins are activated by many different spices. Our spice tolerance depends on our genetics, people have mutations of these proteins which influence our final sensation of spices since most food have blend of different spices. People who have TRPV1 protein mutated they’re less susceptible to capsaicin in chillies (chemical compound that causes burning sensation after eating chilli).*",fireheart727," Is it all the spices or chilli power that causes you trouble? 

The uncomfortable feeling might be due to less production of mucous in your digestive tract. See a gastro doctor. There are drugs that can help. I dont know if this comment belongs here. Not to brag or some shit , but i finished 3 packets of Kurkure and 1 cheetos during a treasure hunt in my college and then they told us to eat mint along with 1 green spice. First of all 

# F

Secondly. Since you are spice averse try herbs more. Look towards western recipes. They are light on the spices and heavy on herbs and aromatics ( like garlic). Don't tell me you are vegetarian as well.  I might cry. What do you mean other spices as well?

I've an intestinal problem since about 8 years and I know it sucks. I can't have any pepper (green black red) not even capsicum.
No garam masalas. The only stuff that goes in my sabzi is rye, jeera, haldi, dhaniya powder, salt.

It isn't easy if you don't have access to a kitchen yourself. I understand your situation.

For me, if I'm traveling, I go for plain idlis, uttapam (ask them to not put chili), plain dosas, rice with yogurt, or omelet (ask them to not put chili). You can also have good food prepared in restaurants by explicitly asking for non-spicy.
Similarly aloo paratha is easy but not every outlet will cater to your special need, so you gotta look who will.

Induction allowed in your hostel room? My spice-averse friends have loads of dahi, either to mix with spicy food if there's no choice, or after to calm their gut. Yes mustard seeds. *Sean Evans has entered the chat* Can eat anything with chilli just fine. Only problem is during the next day morning duties. 

Even a pinch of garam masala means can't sleep without taking antacid. 

Wifey makes biryani/gravies with just 2 pcs cloves and 1cm cinnamon piece but with lots of green chillies and/or chilli powder and coriander powder (made with guntur/byadgi chillis). Never had stomach discomfort.

I swear the definitions of some Indian food in English in restaurants is pretty hilarious I don't have any firangi friends. I feel left out. Two of my friends recently went to China and the people there were actually shocked to see that two people can actually look different and still be from the same country. There is another thing, brown balls dipped in sugar syrup! That’s hilarious! bhaiya aur teekhaaaaa *cough* gol gappa *cough* First time I tried pani puri it massively cut the roof of my mouth. I don't eat pani puris anymore. Since a lot of comment here are about westerners finding everything too spicy, I’ll relay my anecdotal evidence. We live in the NYC suburbs, and my son’s friends are mostly Italian. Jewish, polish, etc. we hang out a lot with their parents (almost every week), and most of them eat food more spicy than my wife (she is Punjabi).

Ismat's Twitter handle where she uploaded this: [Tweet](https://twitter.com/IsmatAraa/status/1243482998332256256) Kinda Out of the loop, I try searching keywords Kejiriwal and migrants and every recent article is about him asking migrants not to leave? 

What's going on? This again proves to me that just good intentions and bhashanbazzi don’t get you results, you need to have the skills and a road map. Hindsight 20-20, however the PM lied that they have made arrangements for every citizen to be provided with basic necessities. 

On top of it, his bhogi and illiterate ministers are playing to populism. Bhogi felt that just by arranging 1000 buses overnight, he will continue to keep his approval levels up. Think of it, he should have had advisors who already know that there are crores if his state laboring their bodies away in these stinky and polluted concrete jungles? (I am just extremely angry)

I am almost to the point where I feel that God chose not to care for the poor. He is not the ever so merciful. We have the politicians fleecing us. People need to be fed,
clothed, saved from each other and we get served instead retelecast of Ramayan. 

“Aatey se sasta daata”

The religious leaders still have the courage to call for namazs. We still need to build our mandirs. Get your propagandist acts together. Without people, there is no religion or politics.

We need to pause here and rethink. This crisis proves that our issues are still the old ones - Roti, kapda, ghar. And, you know what ..  we are tired of the bhakts and pappus both. No, none of them cares. Neither Modi/Raga have the skills or abilities to wield a sword on a white horse and save 1.3Bn of us. again, what the eff was the point of the lockdown. 

Why did we have to ape the western countries like we had the resources on hand to serve the citizens of this country while they were incapacitated, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that this would happen, ppl would starve, crowd up in market places due to hysteria, run to their home towns and villages in jam packed busses and vans just so they can atleast know they can survive this. 

Again what the efff is the point of this lock down?? How does he plan on sustaining himself in Kanpur? It's not like Kanpur's going about its business as usual. His long travel is only jeopardizing the health of others in the country. 

 The current govt. in power has a history of implementing ""noble"" ideas with  disastrous execution, be it GST or note bandi. The present predicament and the 21 day lock down is no different, however, this time the lives of the few outweigh the needs of the many. I am out of words for this plight. I am not even sure if any government even caring to feed these people.

Everyone is thinking this situation as a bad fart which would soon dissipate so that they can forget about it. It's just every scheme of this Govt. Very poorly planned. It's universal. Demonization, GST, Insurance now this. No one is this Govt gives a flying fuck about how the schemes would be implemented. Humanity 🙏 And people will keep voting for these crooks who even in the time of disaster want to use it as a PR exercise. It's always been the same good plans and shitty implementation. [removed] Couldn't we plan to offer them kichudi/langar 2 times a day for 21 days? I hope she helped him somehow financially ofcourse and did not just leave him with her empathy/sympathy and pity. Is it really better to walk for 10 days(considering 8 hrs per day) along with  uncertainty of food and shelter ? I hope they both make it.  

Demonetization 2.0 to kill the poor , Epidemic which might catch us sooner or later seems more scary . BJP's gonna shit the next elections so bad. Gov should take action on it with proper plan? Bhaiyo behno mitro, 4 ghante baad se factory, dukan sab band. Garibo ki ma ki chut. Apna apna dekho. :( Modi deserves the Novel prize for finding the solution to poverty. The solution is to let poor people die out, till the poverty rate drops Rude mode : stupid man how do you plan to sustain yourself while walking all those 500km? And going to kanpur will magically give you home, food and work? And how do you plan to protect the kid from virus/sun/rain while traveling? 

Also the government is inefficient and incapable moron. Those people can spread the virus everywhere. The govt should send them home or build shelters for them but not before properly screening them for covid If I'm not wrong then Yogi has started more than 1000 buses to help these people. Arvindji fucked up. #All thanks to  kejriwal he KICKED out every migrant I don't know whether staying there or going to their village is good idea or not. but it definitely increases the chances of spread of virus in villages. And god forbids, if it happens hell will break lose.
And one more thing, low number of cases in India is not a miracle, a country with such high population density as our with low number of cases means we need to test more.i know you may feel that i am a pessimist.

Didn't panic buy and now I am panic living. The shopkeeper said the people come early and they take 20 of everything (when he told me someone bought 20L milk, I was like WHAAAAAAT), and everyday he tells ""We'll get new stock tomorrow""

My current groceries won't late till this Monday according to my calculations (I am living with 4 people so) Swiggy should be functional from today

Big Bazaar store Status: [https://www.bigbazaar.com/store-status/](https://www.bigbazaar.com/store-status/)

Wait for a local's comment. fwiw, talked to a local grocer today (in Bangalore). Apparently their association is in talks with the police to get permits to open for limited periods (9 to 3 is what is being discussed apparently). He's hopeful of this being sorted out to by today afternoon, and being able to open tomorrow. They'll have to ensure customers maintain minimal distance between them, and only one person enters the store at one time and so on.

As to your present conditions, buy whatever the small stores *do* have (biscuits? noodles? random vegetables) and get by on those till supply straightens out. (it will. In typical fashion, our PM announced stuff without any planning, and over the next two weeks, systems will slowly and painfully come into place) Hello, fellow hadapsarian here !! 

I stay around only and can confirm that grocery stores near shri ram chawk, runwal seagul are open. LPT : this is india, always panic I was thinking that if everyone would stock pile poor people won't get enough food. Everybody did stock piled and I got nothing. Many poor people haven't eaten in three days (who are stranded). And it is just the beginning. When Modi tells you anything, you do opposite of it. I am making an exception for the lockdown thingy though. My 19 years old younger brother fought with me when I said: ""We shouldn't do panic buying"". He then went ahead and bought basic necessities worth for 2 months or so. 

Now, contrary to my earlier belief, EVERYTHING is closed and he has continuously been mocking me for trying to be a civilized citizen in a country filled with morons. 

""I told ya... whats's your opinion now?"" Fellow punekar from Hadapsar.  I am in the same situation as  I stocked up supplies only for a week. Hoping big basket and big bazaar to be operational in coming days. Destination Center in Magarpatta is open. But come early around 7:30 am or it will go out of stock What do you have in your pantry right now? If you tell me the items, I can send you a few tips how to make it last.
Source: in the F&B industry for last 20years. In my city d mart are functional, I think I did good thing by not panic buying. Everything is available. Knowing Indian and state governments’ incompetence and inconsideration from previous situations (demo, local riots/protests etc.), I did go ahead and buy things for the entire month 10 days back. I didn’t hoard anything, I always buy groceries for a month except veggies and it was done earlier this time. I live in Hadapsar Pune and the Star Bazaar at Magarpatta City is open. So is Big Bazaar, and they're delivering at home. You might still need to hold out for a day or two. Maybe borrow a little from a neighbor? A few fistfuls of rice and daal will get you along? See if you can find maggi or pasta. Not sure what else to do here. Earlier Government said not to do panic buying and assured the citizens that government had food stock. But now government isn't allowing people out of the house. So how are we supposed to survive? I did the same. Have not gone out to buy anything yet but will be out of stock very soon. What does the MH government order say? If the decisions weren't sudden , everyone whould have better prepared. Same here. Thankfully I have no dependents living with me so whatever random stuff I could acquire will last me a week, and by careful rationing, even 3-4 weeks if it comes to that Go talk to the nearest police station as to which shops are open in locality and when , they must be knowing it . Tweet it SP-DM or call them . Push the authorities man , if you the educated can't do it , imagine the state of poor Try Dorabjees, they are open and functioning I started buying items two weeks back by couple of store visits. At least rice should last one month I guess. Thankfully a street vendor came today with vegetables, said he got beaten up going to market :( Similar situation as you. 

I don't have any water. The only shop that used to sell those big water cans in my locality is closed. Local grocery is open but they only sell soft drinks and juices. 

There was a paan shop where you could buy packaged bottled water but now that is closed too :( Ask your neighbours. I'm sure they have something they can lend till the groceries eventually open.

I'm pretty sure the online delivery businesses would be functional within days. This morning there was no rice and no atta available in the stores I visited. No Maggi either. 🤷‍♂️ Hi. My parents live in Hadapsar. The Star Bazaar at seasons mall is fully stocked and operational, but for reduced hours. See if you can call in advance and go there. Corona aur Modi ne sabki gand mar di Try Green tokri, they have 6 days delivery as of now, also you may post on r/pune for more local answers. I managed to deliver some stuff by amazon before they stopped. I have heard Bigbazaar is open. worth a try. Try greentokri . They have a scheduled delivery . If they are continuing their delivery then you can get some veggies . May be venture a little farther and see if any stores are open. Obviously, look at demonatisation. This outcome is as expected. No milk, will be out of water by tomorrow. Will have to boil tap water if it doesn't work out Go early morning 7am to 9am and evening 5pm to 6pm. Some shops near me open briefly during that time, so I am surviving thay way, not sure how long I'll have to do this. I depend on water bottles and had to struggle yesterday to get 2 bottles. I hope it ends in 21 days, because I don't know if it lasts for too long I'd be insane by the end of it. It's obvious what needs to happen. Govt won't give a shit. The vendors will come together and give big ass bribe to officials to allow them to work. That's what these fuckers are waiting for. Law enforcement my ass. Goondas every one of them. BIg Bazar is open and delivering in most major cities. Try your luck in morning before 8am. If you do not getting anynear by hadapsar just DM me. I know more places Anyone who has ever lived a year in this country knows never to depend on any government unless you are really poor.

Always follow the precautionary principle because only the paranoid survive. Is Aund Dmart open? Anybody can confirm Try alternate foods including - besan/rice and millet flour, any whole grains/beans that can be sprouted - can make curry or grind and make dosa type thing. Noodles made chowmein style,  eggs if you eat them, etc

I think the best would to buy what you can find and look for recipe help after that. Have you tried Big Bazaar? They are saying that they are home delivering Hadapsar area too. Here is the number i have for hadapsar big bazar : 8237031009. Let me know if it works. Also, Kothrud few groceries are open (More etc.) if you can drive there. What people (including police and administration) don't understand is a lockdown is not a curfew. In a curfew only emergency services remain operational while in a lockdown essential services remain operational. So I really don't understand why they are being hindered as it were a curfew. Instead of trying to suppress everything why not try to manage the crowd like ensuring people maintain the required distance in marketplaces. This can be mostly achieve as I've seen that they have deployed law enforcement personnel everywhere. Star Bazaar is open at Seasons Mall.. Take a token and reach there at the designated time. I live in Pune, and all Dmarts, Reliance Fresh, Reliance hypermarket, Big Bazaar etc are open. No shortage or panic of any grocery items. Please ask your neighbors and friends??? If there's no rice, buy whatever the small stores in your neighborhood have It's just not India. In US also I am not getting Wheat flour. Eating Rice and lentils for couple of days. How can you become an adult and not know that when the authorities say 'don't panic!' they themselves are panicking. Man. 
Magarpatta here. Should have prepared my dude. This is India. I am sorry What the fuck were we doing when the situation was getting serious two months back.

All we had to do was monitor the foreign returnees properly and better, stopped all incoming flights and discouraged non essential foreign travel for a month or so, and enforced quarantines in a strict manner, instead we had the nonsense called nameste trump, and the govt even had time and energy to topple a state government ( madya pradesh) and now after the horse has bolted, modiji comes around giving a verbose speech appealing to the lowest common denominator, with zero planning and haphazard and shoddy implementation, and suddenly we have everybody signing his praise. 

Like what the hell is wrong with Indians, we seem to reward incompetence irrationally and it doesn’t even make sense anymore. #I've been telling you guys this for months, in the most polite nicest way possible, my other account even got banned for it! 

I just wanted to show you what the future looked like for India, give you a time machine... So you could stop a single person from dying (yes that was possible, for dirt cheap), come out with hardly any economic impact and actually maybe be the world's major dominant superpower. Insead I shit all over, accused of fear mongering and being unscientific (yet I'm literally a virologists working in a pharmaceutical company in Navi Mumbai, doesn't take a genius to work out which)

#I love India and all Indians, which is why I gave up my comfy high paying easy lazy European life in Barcelona, to come live here with my family and assist undermining big pharma in the West to help save millions of Indian lives using generic medication, part of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Plan. 

I saw that the delayed response did to Europe, and we even have models about which government policies for how long and starting on which day will lead to which infection and death rates, and they're even more advanced than the joke joint Chinese-WHO studies coming out of the WHO which are based on false Chinese data and don't take into account major factors like climate, weather, wind, humidity or temperature. Infact one of my Indian doctor colleagues has gone to Oxford University in the UK to temporarily assist with that, as the disease spreading to the Southern Hemisphere now the seasons flip is uncharted territory.

The saddest part is how woefully unprepared other advanced developed nations like Australia are, they're slowly beginning to freak out with a few sensationalist headlines like we got in the UK around 6 weeks ago, but this is not a drill this time sadly, and I think we've called wolf (lion?) to be listened to anymore, which is going to mean insane infection rates and numbers of deaths. 

My only hope now is that India is by far the youngest nation on the planet, so even in the worst case scenario you only lose 10% of your population who will be mostly economically inactive old people, and those with chronic diabetes (widespread here). That means you might still come out okay, and so sending wallas home to other states from the major cities, and restricting quarantined for the youngest with tiny death rates probably isn't necessary... But it's mind blowingly hard to explain these complexities to a local. ""But aunty always goes for her afternoon walk"", yes yes that's very nice dear, and I know you respect your elderly relatives, but Wuhanflu ;) doesn't and was designed like that on purpose. When Modi said this would take WW2 levels of effort, he wasn't joking, and it is going to get **intense**. 

I even highlighted to policy makers here in Maharashtra, what happens if the floods and rainy season start early like they are currently in Malaysia and Indonesia? What happens to all the fresh food if the power goes out? How do you enforce a quarantine if people need to go outside, all go to the same cash point, all crowd and shout in a market etc etc just for daily fresh food... Their response was always the same, ""we are following the WHO guidelines bla bla bla"", yeah okay great but the guidelines are currently causing literal genocide in many countries, and you put a rocket on the moon, wake the hell up and use your brains. It doesn't have to be a disaster but **preparation in massive groups is necessary**, and no NGO or third party government is coming to help this time, not even Winnie the Pooh. Tweet your local MLA/MP on the issue. Meanwhile you can reduce your daily usage of Rice and dal to maybe 50% to extend your existing stock. Everything will start by today or tomorrow",2020-03-26 10:16:26
Food,When bhakts ask what Modi could have done for millions of daily wage labourers instead of apologising for their inconvenience...,471,frm2vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frm2vm/when_bhakts_ask_what_modi_could_have_done_for/,94,"In Odisha:

* All households below poverty line/handicapped /old aged got 120 kg rice for ₹1/per kg. The rice was delivered to their houses.

* All the people eligible for MBPY ( for below poverty line/handicapped/senior citizens) got extra ₹4000 cash to spend on groceries during 21 day lockdown.

* Poor kids studying in “anganwadi” also got some amount of rice and food delivered to them.

* Government Doctors got their salaries of next 4 months, early.

* All the salaries of MLAs and CM of Odisha was donated for the state budget of corona virus treatment.

(I’m missing many other things too, but these are the prominent ones)

All of this was done a week before India went to lockdown. In Odisha you won’t see millions of daily wage labourers migrating to their villages right now, despite it being one of the poorer state in India.

Modi could have at least issued the responsibilities for state government before he declared lockdown overnight.

It’s not even funny when Modi government has got billions for corona virus budget and all they could do was some cheap apology.",I_can_believe_that," Odisha did a fantastic job from the start. They were well prepared and they are executing almost everything perfectly. I wonder what might have been the reason and then I realised Odisha is a state that suffers from disasters almost every year. So their level of preparedness to fight such crisis is much better than most of India. It is not a very rich state with lots of industries and thus the population is largely decentralized. Odisha has less number of international travelers and the authorities have worked hard to trace and test the cases. All other states must replicate the Odisha model. To be fair, only state governments can effectively provide most the benefits listed by OP.

What the Central government could have actually done instead was to take the state governments into confidence before announcing the lockdown and ask them to prepare such steps to help people. However, with each passing days, it becomes clearer that such communication was completely absent. But where's the drama in all that. Drama wins hearts , gets votes, lights up twitter. Naveen Pattnaik is quite experienced when it comes to handling disasters and he has done a great job handling this in his state so far. Juicer sirif apnich gand lal kar sakte hain He preaches and repents later. Why should Modi care about daily wage labourers ? There is no incentive to do that.

He just has to do something to bully Indian muslims & Pakistan. Bhakts will vote for him in droves. The question is do Orissa have that much of migrant labourers.

Even kerala migrants are unhappy with the free food,
In such times people like to go to their home well this is the worst time to have this government right now....bhakts will prefer dying of disease than questioning the government....at least during Congress people could freely question the government Before announcing lockdown, he could have called meeting of all CMs. Could have discussed and come up with a plan to tackle this pandemic. Most importantly he should have divided responsibility between States and center (because of federal structure and health being a state matter). Surely someone in this meeting would have preempted this mass exodus. Finally he shouldn't have announced lockdown within such a short notice. I hope you realise all that you stated are exclusively the domain of the state govt and most of the state govt across party lines has been doing a tremendous job other than a few hiccups here and there. In case you want Modi to take responsibility of the State List subjects we might as well fire all the CMs and give the Supreme Leader unbridled power!

P.S- For heaven's sake plz read up about how the federal structure of India works for once! I read your post on r/Moronavirus too. Concise and clear cut difference of execution and thinking ahead. u/Meraxes373 I have been seeing a lot of anti-Modi posts here. While I oppose and criticise Modi on lot of his policies, I believe he has handled the Corona virus crisis very responsibly. (For reference I voted NOTA)

I feel the sudden lockdown was necessary. If it were a planned lockdown, there would have been total chaos. People would have been fighting for resources and would have started hoarding stuff. You only have to observe the current state of USA to know this.

And as for Modi's apology. True it doesn't help people in anyway, but it goes a long way. Never has a politician/leader in the ruling government or for that matter a non ruling party bothered to apologise for much worse things done by them.  An apology shows humility and understanding for the people.

Another argument I have heard is that we are not doing enough testing. People who have actually bothered to study why this is not being done, will already know that India has a very limited number of test kits for now. And with a population like India, if we squander away the kits now, when a full fledged phase 3 does occur, we'll be fucked. Sources for the statements please? Nice Arre bhai Ghar bhi jana hota hai ye sab suvidha lene ke lia...Jab sab ghar hi nahi ja payenge toh kaha se daal chawal saste mai leke Bus stand pr banayenge? 120kg rice for 21 days ???

I am baffled Odisha CM closed 2 big Pvt hospitals and readying them for covid19 treatment only with 1000 beds. Doesn’t jan dhan scheme deposit money directly in people account which can be used 

Also government lockdown without telling ebruronrw should have planned better by sending corcular to syate governments to make sure all food and grocery shops open ""Mere liye tum logo ko taali bajane ka mauka nahi milta agar mein aisa karta""

:Our lord and saviour Shri. Mudi. first thing is he should stop naming schemes and funds after himself and his position. that is the first step in curing him of his immense narcissism, which is at the root of most of the problems with this govt. Make the food reach the mouths of the hungry - just giving away rations is not addressing the problem at hand. It's likely that the supplies will get hoarded & won't reach the needy.  

I think, govt shd setup community kitchens to ensure nobody is going hungry during these testing times. That's really great source for info on odisha? this was done a week before lockdown?? bruh where are you getting your info from?

also what about the other 28 states and 7 union territories? Great points! Links to each would have knocked this post out of the park I guess virus could have given a weeks notice before entering India. [deleted]",2020-03-30 15:03:12
Food,I've never been so angry and frustrated with the Government.,248,fq0ui4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fq0ui4/ive_never_been_so_angry_and_frustrated_with_the/,135,"While the privileged are sitting at homes, doing pointless shit like posting challenges on Instagram, There are literally millions of daily wage workers, homeless and deprived people. More than 1 lakh people are stranded at the UP Delhi border. Who the fuck will look after them if they contract the disease? Who the fuck will care about them? 

These people are at many times the only breadwinners of the family. Can we be so ignorant, that we readily allow entire families of poor to get destroyed? Some  owners of factories, contractors have simply haven't paid these workers and simply turned a blind eye towards these people. 

People like you and me have plenty of surplus money and resources. There are people who literally completely depend on their next month's salary to run their houses. How do you think would they manage?

Government just abruptly closed down the entire nation. What arrangement did it make so that the poor reach their homes along with their familes safely? It is not as simple as booking a cab or renting a car for them. People are literally walking miles and miles to reach home. Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police. Don't they deserve spending this dark and difficult time with their familes, in their homes?
Try to imagine the immense fear and desperation and the helplessness of these people.

Everybody is praising the Indian government on how efficiently they brought an early lockdown. They don't realize what the poor are going through, simply because the society doesn't care about them. 

Please think  again, if you think my thoughts have political origin.",amanagarwalx," I absolutely see the need for this lockdown. If we don't, this disease will spread unchecked and kill _a lot_ of people, mostly these poor guys who are already malnourished and living in horrid conditions.  

_But_ the government should have first implemented a system where there are daily or weekly food deliveries to the poor. We can't let them just starve. Additionally they should have implemented a freeze on rent payments or a government subsidy for those landlords so the poor aren't burdened with it. Food, water and shelter should have first been guaranteed by the government _before_ the lockdown. 

As for allowing them to go home before the lockdown, that is not at all wise. Because of the inadequate testing done by the government we don't know the extent of the spread within cities. We're fairly confident the spread is limited in rural areas though but even that isnt 100% certain, because again, we're not testing nearly as much as we should. 

But allowing mass migration of millions of people from urban to rural is a good way to make sure this virus spreads rapidly among India's impoverished rural population. And mark you, the healthcare infrastructure in rural India is woefully inadequate. We're already going to struggle with the overstretched healthcare facilities in cities. Rural India isn't even close to being prepared for this. Look at how it's ravaging Italy and the US. Imagine the damage it will do here where our healthcare facilities are inadequate in the best of times, where we have high population density, poverty and malnourishment. 

This isn't just a pandemic anymore it's atleast two disasters rolled into one. We're going to see massive unemployment, we're going to see a lot of businesses, big and small, failing. We're going to see a global economic depression not seen since 1929 and maybe even worse than that. And if this disease gets _really_ bad we're going to start seeing a breakdown of our food production and distribution because the poor that grow our food will be sick or dying in droves. Which means, in India alone, millions of deaths from famine, food riots in cities and a possible breakdown of law and order. Of course, this is a worst case scenario and hopefully things won't get so bad but preventing that means we need to take this virus _very seriously_. 

So if the government is finally taking extreme measures to slow the spread then yeah I support it. I don't support the fact they did not account for the well being of the poor before doing this, which they should have. But this lockdown...it's necessary. 

Look, If we're looking at this realistically, there is no 'flattening the curve' for India. The window for that has passed. Cases will spike and it will overwhelm our healthcare system. People are going to die because there won't be enough ICU beds or enough ventilators. The only thing this lockdown will achieve in my opinion is that it will delay that spike, buying the government crucial time to acquire or manufacture more PPE, ventilators and beds. At the very least they can try to raise the bar on the capacity of our healthcare infrastructure so that fewer people die. The government should have started preparing two months ago, we should have converted factories to manufacture PPE and ventilators back then. But like most governments the world over, they were slow to react. And the price for that early inaction is we go into lockdown now. The choice is being in lockdown now or having thousands more preventable deaths later. Neither are good choices but no one has the luxury of good choices anymore in a global disaster of this magnitude. That's the reality the world over and we need to adapt to this because if we don't _people will die_. 

Guys, we are in uncharted waters here. Every country on this planet will have to take _extreme_ measures to prevent massive loss of life. This is the defining disaster of our time. Even the 1918 pandemic or the world wars did not shut down the world like this has. We do not have history to learn from because this has _never happened before_. I've come back home after a fairly long time and have duly switched my parents' evening diet from Tez to NDTV. So now in have two senior citizens who're as heartbroken as I am from 9 to 10.

Ravish's primetime makes your stomach churn. Hard to believe such things happen in India while we bury are heads in the sand like ostriches. people who just a few months ago were ready to take in refugees from other countries cant even take care of their own citizens, where are all those I Support CAA people now? This mass exodus of migrant workers is what happens when a government is myopic to the point of blindness. A proper plan could and would have prevented this. A proper stimulus package planned in advance, and not one quickly put together in reaction to this, should have been there. This mass exodus has many, many, many problems surrounding it. For one, can you imagine people turning into nomads overnight when food and water that's usually available everywhere is missing thanks to a lockdown? Can you imagine, how these men, women, and children are supposed to *walk* hundreds of kilometers in absence of public transport? It's beyond cruel what the Centre has compelled these already oppressed groups of people to do right now. These migrant workers will also (many already are) face the brutality of lathi-happy cops. With state borders locked, they will essentially remain nomads, unless proper arrangements are made for them.  And, worst of all, these migrant workers, who don't have the luxury to wash hands for twenty seconds with soaps (can't afford soaps, can't afford to waste what little water they have), how are they supposed to remain safe from the pandemic? It's also equally likely that they make take the coronavirus along with them to their villages. And let's not forget that rural public healthcare is already in shambles. Those rushing to fellate the prime minister for his ""brave"" and ""strong"" step do not fucking understand how this lockdown has already disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. [source](https://twitter.com/BucketheadCase/status/1243227045783425024) It’s very heartbreaking , we shouldn’t have even let me be so vulnerable and live pay check to pay check for one meal in the first place Although it's very difficult for the government to *plan it all out* in a ""quick"" decision like what they took, but, they could have been more proactive in addressing the challenges coming out from it. 

YES lockdown was and is the need of the hour, but not at the cost of poor management, which by the way is not all about pre planning. [deleted] #21daychallenge Cant agree more Also with aadhaar details, these migrant workers can be easily helped by the government, But they use our identity only for snooping never ever think of helping the needy. Someone should remind Amit Shah most of these guys will vote in Nov. Bihar election atleast then he will wake up. Donate to the local people who are helping & donating food to poors. If you're in a big city then I guess you can even donate on platforms such as grofers/zomato. There should also be a relief fund setup by your state govt, you can donate there as well. Sad but true. Since the time PM Modi announced about the lockdown I knew that this is going to be a huge disaster. India is not prepared for a situation like this. We don't have the infrastructure for this. Hell, we don't even have the accountability of our people how are we going to implement something that was thought of overnight. It's just the beginning of the lockdown, we still a long way to go and who knows if the situation is better or not after that. Personally I feel that the government should have left at least one mode of transportation open for people to go with reduced service time. Blanket banning all modes is a very extreme step and it seems counterproductive at the moment. These places like the ones they showed on TV  today and other populous stations like Howrah, CST station, etc are huge breeding ground at the moment. Whatever the government was trying to stop is not happening anymore. Because if one goes down we all go down with them. The people are stuck there with nowhere to go, with no food and improper hygiene and whatever services were being promised is not adequate.

The only thing we can do is donate. Help our house help and the people they know. Help the daily wage workers. Godspeed Whats weird is I thought there would be further notifications, clarifications, and announcements by Modi. None so far! 

His dikatats cause chaos and he doesnt turn up to clear things up or provide any sense of direction. The guy just reads what's on screen. Nationwide Lockdown is what happens when privileged people are untouched by poor people's problem. 

India needs self quarantine. Nationwide Lockdown in India is like burning the house down to kill the rat. The rat might give you plague and you may die, but burning the house down will lead to a much bigger catastrophe. rich people brought disease, now poor suffering for no reason. I am really pissed the government did nothing in Feb, oh yes they were busing buying MPs. If we have restricted foreign travel at that time everything would have been fine. Who the fuck believes china anyway. WHO shithole. So whats your proposed solution? What the lockdown meant - ""Stay where you are. Don't move. Or you might help spread the disease"".             
But, what quite a few people thought about the lockdown was - ""Everything is closed off. Go back home""           

The government doesn't want you to go back to your hometown. People that are walking hundreds of kilometres home aren't going to magically earn money once they reach home. In fact, they're only putting their loved ones in danger.           

But yea, I do agree that the govt should've handed out masks to all the poor people for free.

Edit: to all the people that are furious that I didn't even think about food and shelter.. . Well, the only reason I didn't mention it is because the govt WILL and HAVE TO take care of those. The govt. has already began or will be providing free ration to all the poor and needy.  Food is something that will be taken care of. But if the disease spread like it did in US or Italy, there's no going back, for a country like us.

It's a pandemic. Everyone will suffer to various degrees. Either these people should be allowed to go home or they should be provided with food ,water and shelter with basic hygiene necessities else they are at huge risk. Can somebody please think about the alleged infiltrators in remote camps? What's even the medical facility there?
It will be a genocide.
Remember that Anne Frank died of a curable disease, not from a gas chamber. Another surgical strike. So the people who elected a rioter twice are suffering? Shocker! Didn't the government announce a relief package for the poor? I get your frustration with how the underprivileged are struggling but what's your beef with the privileged? They are at home all day so ofcourse they are going to do dumb shit to pass time and keep themselves sane and busy.


Coming to your other rant about how Govt handled the financially challenged people, look there is absolutely no doubt that an immediate lockdown of the country was required. We don't have time for planning everything from A-Z about every section of the society before shutting everything down. I am not sure if you have seen the spread rate for other countries but it's pretty fucking fast.

Yes it is really really terrible and unfortunate about how the underprivileged are struggling and taking the brunt of this whole shitty mess...but do you have a better way in mind that the govt could have handled things? We have millions and millions of such people in our country. It's impossible to make arrangements for them on short notice. Yes, it'd be government's fault if they fail to do something for these people in the coming days/months...but it's way too quick to criticise the government. Do you have anything better?

Yo the man just didn't happen to like our food, what's the big deal? I think his paper caught fire in morning  🤣🔥 With outrage like this, more people will pretend like they love it. Proves his tweet. For the laziest who aren't going to check the news - he said ""Indian food is terrible & we pretend like it isn't."" The outrage isn't that he doesn't like Indian food, it's about him associating everyone else with him. If he had just said that he personally doesn't prefer Indian food, there wouldn't be this much of a fuss - but this is just a typical case of generalization, & I'm glad that he got owned for it. Lots of people defending indian food in his replies were non-indian as well People are harassing a dude for saying he doesn't like the same food as them. What have we become. Why take everything so personally? Someone said something, people got something to say to him. Absolutely nothing that should be newsworthy. Chill out. This guy hasn't tried Vada Pav and Butter Chicken Yet. Finger licking good. Well he was asked to write something controversial. HE DID THAT. The vast majority of 'Indian' restaurants in the US serve mughalai food which is highly oily and spiced.

More than Indians typically have at home Well Indian food is terrible - have been eating it all my life. Indians jump at the opportunity to defend a white man offending them. If someone asked 'Whats your most controversial dating/sex opinion?' and the answer followed 'Black women are terrible' can you imagine the ~~shitshow~~ shitstorm that would follow? Eh- big deal. So he doesn't like Indian food. He isn't wrong. Everything is so oily and unhealthy. I've been trying to eat healthy and I've realised that there's very little healthy stuff available. Plus everything has so many flavours at once. Indian food in general tastes like food that's been made by a people who only recently came out of starvation and thus decided to throw everything in a pan and eat it because they never had it before I dislike how this guy is entitled to speak on behave of whole nation . He is not even elected representative . Of course people found this to be racist and about white male privilege and shit too. Everything is. No one can have harmless opinions anymore.

My brother is a 3rd year resident doctor and he told me that their is no proper safety/precautions for them. They are being provided fucking plastic sheet vest for treatment smh. And he is in government hosiptal. So leave the conditions in private hospitals. I talked to him after our ""beloved modiji's"" live. And he said to me that instead of doing such chutiyapa why he is not providing us test kits, protective gears. Why it has been so delayed. As if they didn't expected the virus to come in our country. Everyone did! Why isn't he doing anything about the migrant workers?? Why our home minister just vanished at this point. Lighting diyas or banging thaalis isn't going to change anything. Keeping the ""morale high"" is a different thing. Do that if you are capable of controlling the situation and all this as side things. But their isn't much progress and it's very concerning. How many test kits are only reserved for VIPs. Doctors are working like slaves right now and not much facilities are being provided to them and don't even talk about the patients. *BC, galli mein Havan karenge 9th ko* - Bhakts meanwhile. Honestly, you just have to dig for it. Various sources report the lmeasures being taken and the hospitals being opened, reformatted, etc. I'm sorry OP. Mai to mobile ki fleshlight jalaunga hi vo bhi poore 9 min tak. The answer is pretty much - nothing has been done. India is headed for massive doom considering how bad the social distancing was in feb and march. If the US and Italy are any examples...the numbers are going to look worse for India. They need testing and wuhan style lockdowns for April to be able to control and treat the sick. These recent corona virus antics of Modi aren't mutually exclusive to OP's post. Both have their purpose. Placebo is a real thing just in case people have forgotten. Clapping slowly Many of the things you want to know are released here-

https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/centre-seeks-sc-direction-that-no-media-should-publish-covid-19-news-without-first-ascertaining-facts-with-govt-154601 Well thanks to the mullahs we have even more positive patients around who won't be around for these Nation motivating events in the future... I wish the government (PMO department. They have the muscle to get all the data) hired people on payroll whose sole job will be to increase transparency and improve trust factor between the govt functioning and citizens. In this case, they can show a dashboard of PM cares donation and areas of usage intended/ actual money spent. Or, how is government allocating resources to tackle the mess or where does the money go from all the excise duty hikes or how much money has been spent on shit stuff (like statues) or how much money has been spent on bringing back Indians from other countries or how is pm cares different from pm relief fund.. 

Hire me PMO. I can setup a team track items of national interest. I can create awesome dashboards and visualise data points which is easy for Media and citizens to understand. I can really get behind the Numbers. A team of let’s say 10, and an annual salary impact of say 2 cr will be drop in ocean for you guys and this will go a long way in repairing some trust.",2020-04-03 23:41:28

My domestic helps husband decided to go to rehab for his alcohol issues and addiction. He lied about how much he drank and after only the first day he died of a severe seizure because of the withdrawal.

Alcoholism is a horrible horrible thing. People aren't culprits they are victims. Before you end up bringing up a moral brigade understand you don't know shit and we don't know shit.

He is still my favourite actor but the respect is gone. Because of his comments Harsha bhogle was removed from the BCCI commentary panel Amitabh Bachchan should stick to what he knows which is acting.. 

In times like this, using your star power to create misconceptions or spread untruths is just idiotic. Low IQ No need for this approval,  as the medical journals he used for claiming it never mentioned the flies.  He interpreted it in his own way,  i think some of government people also included to push it as swacha bharat abhiyan. How credible is this then?

Abhishek, take his phone away. Is boomer ke phone sieze karo yaar amit ji aap chutiye hain. He's correct. He said virus can survive in shit longer and asked the people to not shit outside. I am not sure where the flies thing came from. 

There are many vectors that may transmit the virus from shit to humans. It's very improbably but is possible.

Best practice to not shit outside. It already spreads a lot of diseases and is unhygienic. Shit in a bathroom ffs. Very interesting. Flies do have quite a bit of hair on their legs and hence if they previously sat on contaminated surface and moved around to another sticky surface like the food we are eating, we could shoot the fly away, but it'd be too late and we ingest the food it sat on.",2020-03-27 16:54:24

They knew in their hometown (mostly villages) they will not die from the hunger at-least! \[Wood + cow dung + water+basic ration is still almost free and abundant in villages \]

 For them this 500-1000 km walk was worth taking chances. Actually its the tendency of priveleged class to see the world with different glass is the thing which creates divide. When we see others roaming during lockdown we say 'why are they roaming?','can't they just follow the rules?' but when we go outside even for vague reasons it becomes essential. They are migrating cause if they don't and even survive the pandemic , they'll of hunger or beneath the burden of all the responsibilities for the dependents. That isn't happening in my Family though. We are still blaming the gov. . Both Central&State. Nobody is complaining about the migrant labours moving to their home states , because every one did this , I think your family does not represent the majority . This is not hypocrisy. You're related to them. They know you personally. So of course they care more about you.

This is apathy. Like you're being apathetic to the same people you are calling out.

Another question : Find me one person in the world who is not a hypocrite. Seriously. Yeah, you're really skimming the surface here. You need to call out the innate human instinct which makes people very biased towards their kin, thus applying a different set of rules to their children, when they should just say 'Whatever dude. You're on your own'.

There's a hypocrisy in Upper/Middle class. But it lies in the fact that they are the ones who probably brought the virus to India, so its their bad. Migrant Workers didn't go to China after all. Man you’re spot on with it. That sort of hypocrisy has always been around but now, with a pandemic at hand, it’s consequences are much much more dire What many people fail to realise that these people are not going home for the sake of it. They are going because they have nowhere to live.

They cannot pay rent since everything is under lockdown. House owners have refused to accommodate them because it doesn't make financial sense for them to house people who cannot pay rent.

Atleast in their villages they would have a house to live in and food to eat, till this thing blows over. Maybe if they are lucky they can find some temporary employment there. It’s betha not beta Postponed marriage - Had to explain family members that if I come from US, and 100s of relatives do haldi probably everyone gets corona and not paneer pasanda After seeing the protest of guest labourers in Kerala demanding roti because they don't want chawal(rice), I am finding it very difficult to empathise with them. The goal of the Indian nationwide lockdown is to protect the top 15-20% of Indians, the elites and the middle-class. The price is paid by the bottom 15-20% of Indians, the day laborers, the lower castes, the poor.

After all, who are the ones who will be least affected by the lockdown? Who are the ones that will benefit the most once the coronavirus is kept in check? 

If you are reading this post in India, you should be thankful that the Indian government is willing to sacrifice the lower class people to protect your way of life. 

Sleep well. Dude, just stop. There's no meaning in ranting about that. It is what it is.
What needed is action. Decide something, and spend your whole life in achieving it.

Middle class people? They want everything but don't want to risk anything.

Decide. Take action. Walk on the path that no one knows. OP what's your opinion about migrant workers going back home now? Anyone, be it the rich or the poor, who breaks the lockdown right now is choosing their comfort over the lives of crores. They are consciously deciding to endanger the lives of thousands. Their motive could range anywhere from having some fun to maybe saving their own lives, but that doesn't change the consequences of their action. 

Yesterday hundreds of migrant workers decided to protest in the streets in Kerala so that they can go home to North India because they don't like South Indian food. Do they warrant any sympathy from the middle class and upperclass? Isn't it hypocrisy to call out only the middle and upperclass about them traveling and not the poor? Upper-caste Hindus have always been very critical of people they consider to be inferior to them: Dalits, Adivasis, Koreans, Slavs, Nigerians, Muslims, Christians, Shintos etc. Workers are moving to a place which cannot contain infected people. It workers were moving from village to a city for Healthcare then no one would raise an issue.

Its hit hypocrisy, it's Calling out stupidity of people. they are poor, who cares. I don't understand why you write this. I don't remember the poor being given any request anywhere. I thought everyone knew that.",2020-03-30 18:24:14

This seems to be triggered by the news of Delhi government providing transportation facility for people going home in Delhi (bad idea tbh).

Edit: even though they are complaining that they don't have food now, they actually refused the district administration offering them food saying it's not North Indian food. The district administration then offered them uncooked food supplies so they can cook whatever food they desire but all they want is to go home.",zeusbb," Even if Kerala arranged vehicle for them they'll stopped at Tamilnadu/Karnataka border there is no point in this protest \- It is a damned if you do, damned if you dont situation.

\- If the govt arranges transport (trains/buses), even with Central Govt approval, anyone taking it is likely to be part of one of the largest clusters.  A good % of them can end up severely ill/dead.

\- If we dont, we have the present situation.  Maybe a daily living wage?  Then the question is who pays.  Central will look to State and vice versa.

The grass is greener on the other side.  One week in their hometown and some will be ready to come back. They are illiterate migrants , they don't know anything better. Most of them live in congested room with 20+ fellow workers. Govt should give counseling to calm them down and provide isolated sheltors to avoid Corona outbreak. These migrants are gonna get a lot of hate from these states once this is all over.

I mean if these states are providing free food or raw vegetables to cook their own food, then what's the problem? I'd understand if there was no food or a place to stay but If there is adequate food and a roof on their head, they should just SHUT UP ! 

A lot of people are stuck where they are, unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. Lock them up if they create a ruckus.

P.S Delhi screwed up BIG and the centre has to share the blame coz this wasn't planned well. policeman: Ae George lathi eee da!!

In fairness its the mental distress causing the movement. This happened 500m from where I am right now. Ama *It was near payippad junction in Kottayam district. At first it seemed as if they were protesting due to dearth of food, but later district collector stated that what they wanted from govt was a means of travel to their own states.*

*Govt will ensure the safety of these immigrants and will provide safe travel options once this lock down will be lifted. Govt will impose restrictions to obviate any similar incidents in future.* It seems like someone instigated them by spreading false information like their home state was taking them back, etc. Also even if it qas pssible gathering during a time like this was the worst they could do. The police could have taken a completely different and darker route due to panic if it was any other state. Let Pisht send 100 buses from UP.

Bharat Mata Ki Jai. These people are acting really dumb. Nothing is going to work, they have seen Delhi migrants return to their homes. Every rich state like kerala, TN, Gujrat, MH will see a wave of exodus. This is whats happens when you do shit without planning. There is currently a video circulating on WhatsApp saying these people are all Muslims coming from Bangladesh and they were instigated by MediaOne (the same news channel which had notice filed by I&B Ministry). They are now claiming it is a terrorist plot by them. I am having an argument with my dad about this....This was what I asked

1)Who is claiming if all if not any of them are Bangladeshi?

2) How come all of them who protested be Muslims?

While I do believe there something else behind this, turning this into a terror plot is a very veiled claim lacking any sort of hard evidence. Regarding food, they could be given daal rice which is not hard to prepare in case they don't want to have south indian food.

Just because of unconfirmed claim of people not liking the food, we cannot shift the blame from govt. on people.

In the delhi situation everyone is happy criticizing govt. (be it centre or state), but now suddenly people are shifting the blame on workers and calling them entitled without listening their side of story coz according to them kerala govt. can never be wrong.

Both the Kerela govt. and the central govt. should ensure adequate food is provided to them. preparing daal rice is not difficult, and it would cater to their north indian taste as well. >even though they are complaining that they don't have food now, they actually refused the district administration offering them food saying it's not North Indian food. The district administration then offered them uncooked food supplies so they can cook whatever food they desire but all they want is to go home.


Honestly, they're being just too much. Government has done whatever they can to keep them safe and fed. But they have decided to be a pain in the a**. After this, Malayalees would be totally justified in staying away from North Indian migrants for atleast next 2 weeks. It's really hard to combat fear and frustration in this situation. You can't deal with this by yelling at them and calling them uneducated or ungrateful. Even the most educated person struggles with their emotions. What people need to do is acknowledge the deep pain they're in right now. Someone needs to sit them down and say yes, this is a scary and frightening situation. We're sorry that you're in this position. We know you want to get home. But for your safety and more importantly, your family's safety, we can't allow that right now. We will provide as much as possible for you to stay comfortable. For the time being, you are our guests, blah blah blah etc etc etc. I guarantee if people are nice about it, they'll feel much better and much more amenable to staying put. These are the types of people who need to get their shit beaten out of them how can North Indian workers work in Kerala ? language is totally different. maybe they are from neighbouring states?",2020-03-29 16:30:51
Food,Spicy food causing upper back pain?

Since then, I only had Indian food, mostly street food and cheap restaurants. I'm already getting used to the spiciness unlike at the beginning.

Two days ago I started having acute upper back pain between my shoulder blades. Pain when turning neck, especially downwards. Feeling of being ""stuck"". I'm personally thinking I got a bad knot from sleeping in a weird position + poor posture.

Now, everybody has different unprofessional diagnosis and advice for that kinda thing; muscle sprain, pulled, knot. The most original I've heard is that all the spices somehow build up gas that can get stuck in the back; should go away over a few days or with a muscle relaxant. Apparently that would be a pretty common phenomenon in India, including amongst Indians themselves. To me that sounds pretty pseudoscience, can't any source about it anyway. But I'm curious what Indians have to say about it. Is this really a common saying?",PaulChomedey," I read the title and immediately thought India.  It’s a country where everyone’s a doctor.  Though gas built up to cause back pain is a first.

I would visit a local massage therapist who might be able to help I don't think so. Gas pain moves around. If you are having pain in a specific area, go to a real doctor. Absolute BS. Do stretches when you wake up and maintain general physical fitness levels. It could be sprain in your shoulder or neck. Maybe you've been lugging heavy backpacks or such.

Get a body massage done, should cost anywhere between ₹300-1000

At a meeting on Wednesday, party chief JP Nadda made the decision, which the party hopes, will help five crore people fed.

LEL, this isnt even 1/2 of a plan. WTF are our politicians and babus smoking when they plan? Everyone of these tragedies could have been avoided if someone decide to use their brains and act sooner. Govt. sends Airplanes to rescue NRIs but migrant laborers from Bihar and Jharkhand are forced to walk their way back home. All this because NRIs donate crores to BJP while migrant workers cannot. I actually whined about this shit a week ago. The absolute lack of brains in these people is astounding. But then again they don't give a fuck and a lot of rich people don't empathize with the poor so they think these people are sacrificing.

I want to scream at people who just decided to cancel all the trains just to please Modi and for Modi to just be pleased with his own performance in Prime time without actually thinking of the poor and vulnerable. Like how callous can you be to let poor people walk for days just so that you can get a promotion or feel happy about yourself. Somebody has to hold these people accountable. And I don't mean just election. Because a vast majority of people are secure at their home and they see it as a noble sacrifice as long as they aren't the ones sacrificing. I wish someone could have sued the government on account of these people. You just can't allow people to suffer to massage your own egos. Hate the PM for lockdown without any measures for daily wages., though atleast State Government are doing their little part. 

Netas people will never even thought about the situations like this. I had this argument yesterday about this with a 20 year old guy.. he said it's fault of these ppl that they give birth to 6 7 babies and don't save money .. why blame govt .. I schooled him for next half an hour about how these ppl desperately need help .. and how will govt exactly identity those needy ppl it has promised to give 1000₹ .When they don't have a database of unorganised sector workers. all he said was .."" govt apna kaam kr rhi hai. . 1000₹ de to rhi .. ""


This is exactly what wrong with bhakts .. they immediately get triggered once you hold govt accountable .. the whole conversation was so baffling, he said ""they live like insects"" and other terminology .. They should have passed Emergency law to not allow any one to be kicked out of house for this month or any rent person can stay 1 month extra if rent is expiring soon . But Indians love this shite, if anything the demonization nonsense goes to show is that he will be rewarded for this shite show with another term. (All he has to do is time another Pulwama close to the elections to close the deal, rinse and repeat) 

I have lost all hope in my fellow Indians to do anything remotely intelligent, zero critical thinking the lot of them and the collective intelligence should be one of the worst in the entire planet.

Easily swayed by emotions and lies and always beholden to anybody who has a way with words. 
The malaise is set and I am seriously considering emigrating because I just can’t take it anymore. We as a country take a lot of effort to airlift stranded NRIs .. Wonder why we never take same kind of interest to take care of our own citizens who are now stranded within their own country.. Should ppl leave the country first to be treated with dignity by the government ? [removed] 10 months?

Food,"The plight of daily wagers shows how wrong Indian society is. Instead of giving people fair wages, we are now donating to ""feed the wager"" campaigns as if they are some animals needing help.",320,fsqma8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsqma8/the_plight_of_daily_wagers_shows_how_wrong_indian/,122,"No where in the civilized world can you get a human to do stuff for you, 12 hours a day, for less than Rs. 300.   
The people working as masons, painters, fabrication welders etc. are all paid less than the minimum wage in most cities, despite being quite skilled at their work. Same goes for maids and cooks in most parts of the country. Someone I know hires a full time maid for 20k in Mumbai, with food and lodging included. But many don't get that much, especially in smaller cities and villages. Security guards even in places like Gurgaon and Delhi earn less than 10k a month.   
Growing up, it was common to see and expect a slum in the vicinity of a new apartment complex because that is where the ""bais"" and their ""car-washing"" husbands stay. That has not changed at all, it has worsened now and slums are home to many more professions (including TEACHERS of all people). 

We often hear people say ""life in India is really good because you have a maid, a cook and a driver for daily life"". This is because these folks never got what they deserved. They are exploited and without contracts. 

I find it incredibly insensitive to see campaigns like ""feed a daily wager"" as if they are zoo animals. No one gives a shit about their well being and fair pay when they should. The ""good life"" in India is because the middle class and the rich just want the wagers to survive like animals. Nowhere in the world would this same middle class with their level of income, even if they earn in USD, get so many human services for such cheap rates. 

I believe this is happening to white collar jobs as well. For all the ""no-skills-in-graduates"" bullshit, many graduates even from good colleges almost work for free and have to depend on their parents. 

TLDR: Indians brag about having maids and cooks and cleaners as a quality of life enhancer. Truth is that they can afford them ONLY because they are being exploited. The current campaigns to ""feed the wager"" could have been more sensitive to their plight and focused on creating a formal, contracted workforce of helpers, and unorganized sector employees.",The_Real_Deshbhakt," You can't help it.

The workforce is huge in number, you will always find some other working for a lower wage. Even indian middle class is not really rich. If these people got "" western"" wages, no one except the rich could afford them. Increasing everyone's pay also won't work coz so many Indians work in the informal sector and they are competing with each other to get work. If indian labour costs go up MNCs will just move to a cheaper country. The only way is to redistribute wealth for super obscene rich to social security. Here, I feel india isn't ready for a Scandinavian style model because there isn't enough rich people to support social programs on that scale.... Yet Catch 22 though.. if you somehow magically enforce a higher wage for domestic help,etc. Most of them will be unemployed since Dishwashers and Roombas will become price competitive. In some areas were already there, maids in Hyderabad gated communities charge Rs 1000 per month for utensils. A dishwasher costs the same in running costs. If the maids charges go up to 2000, a dishwasher would be a  clear winner even accounting for the extra work. For Roomba the breakeven point is similar,and that doesn't account for price reductions as a result of economy of scale. For warehousing, Amazon uses robots outside India and people in India cause people are cheaper. I believe similar stuff would apply for construction.

Do you disagree? The problem is not with the middle class. Most of middle class wouldn't be able to pay their domestic help anything more than they are paying right now. They themselves are living paycheck to paycheck and probably have EMIs and bills to pay.

(Not talking about upper middle class) You're right OP, lets not collect funds to help support people at risk right now. Instead, let's figure out a monumental labour reform while we're all sitting at home and the country is in lockdown, after all, that's the need of the hour.

People who want to help the poor not starve to death are the real animals. Supply & Demand, way too many daily wagers, ie; easier to replace or find someone else to work for lower. No daily labour works 12 hours a day for less than 300, don't make it look like we live in the 18th century England or something. An unskilled labour takes atleast minimum 400 to work 9 to 5 (plus or minus half hour). With a break from 1pm to 2. Thats not negotiable. 

Now i get that 400 instead of 300 isn't that much but the thing is not about Numbers being slightly higher, but the picture you are painting isn't correct. Its tough out there but not to the degree you are saying it is. 1. India is not USA. People here are free to unionise and we have really tough labour laws to safe guard the rights of workers.

2. Wages aren't artificially supresed. Our huge population is a source of cheap labour. 

3. Our per capita income is really low. Question for fair wages doesn't arrive with a per capita income of 2000$. People will be living with really low wages. Dude. shut the fuck up and employ people at higher wages yourself.

And don't say bUt tHE sYStem WoNt LeT mE.

Tired of preachy idiots here who haven't done anything other than earn a salary. Lack of proper manufacturing sector is the reason why so much manpower is available in such low price. Overpopulation.... They get what they voted for.Negligence and charity. eat it and shut up.or actually realize that things have to change for things for them to get better.

But no,these are the ones most swayed by jingoism Get a life Man.
You are being hurt even with the tag line. We have bigger problems than your sensitive feelings.

'Feeding' is something bad? Like seriously? Cleaning - I've realized I don't need maids anymore if I clean after myself, wash dishes soon after using them. Planning to buy a dishwasher and roomba after the lockdown to replace cleaning maid.

Cooking - have simplified the type of dishes that I eat. Instead of asking maid to make complex curries like Rajma, Chole etc., I'm making simple Daals and sabji. Rotis only on weekends. Losing lot of fat too in the process. Anything special gets ordered.

General Help - have organized myself to keep things back where they belong. I'm on a drive to let go of things that I have hoarded, so the house is looking neat, and organized.

IF it becomes a season epidemic, I see a lot of maids, cleaners losing jobs. It's a supply and Demand thing. Unless these villagers in BIMARU belt take more care about their family planning ventures ..they will keep pumping into this Labor supply pipeline, and cause reduction in wages. 
  When the matter reach down and hits ""Roji Roti"" Bell ... Ppl become ready to make any kind of sacrifices. The Lodha Group are built by keeping these guys in poverty , modern slavery You're actually 100% right. We are not a society that values labour. We tried to be at first, but that respect didn't extend far enough to cover large subsets of the population. We see manual labourers and such as beneath educated people, and yet we desperately rely on those same people to build roads, build houses, harvest our crops, sweep our homes, cook, clean, do laundry, etc. Society would not survive if people did not do these jobs. 

There is no such thing as unskilled labour. There is only such a thing as unvalued labour. What is the general wage for labourers in your locality? In Kerala, we have to pay around 800-900 rupees per day for 5-6 hours of work excluding lunch break. I don't know how contractors make them work, but when they are called individually they won't work in the afternoon hours, like 1-3 due to extreme heat. We also have to give them water, tea/coffee according to their demand, lunch(some will go to hotels), etc. If both husband and wife work, they can live somewhat comfortably.

These daily wage works and coconut tree climbing are two of the most profitable jobs in Kerala and they make more than low paid office workers, temporary teachers,etc.

The wages are typically less for migrant labourers. But I used to know people earning about ₹20,000 before demonetization. Welcome to Capitalism You're absolutely correct. Human resources are available for cheap,thats one of the crucial reason why western countries make their industries in Asian countries. Indian,china.

Educated people here, tell me..",tiddu," I tried doing the sane thing of not going out for the last 2 weeks.
For the entire 2 weeks was not able to get basic things on a daily basis like milk, bread eggs.
Ordered through bigbasket and to my surprise they cancelled the order after I waited for it for 1 whole week.

Today I finally gave up and went out to buy groceries and ended up coming in contact with at least 20 people. I hope you've things for few days.  This is a massive undertaking by the govt for which our country sure as hell wasn't prepared for ever. Nor does our govt knows what they are doing right now. There was no plan in place ever for this. So give them a few days. As always our govt is few days late with taking the right decision. So for now hang in there, 2-3 days later I am hoping they will get their shit together and understand the gravity of doing this so haphazardly, once they understand that they will get the daily essentials everywhere in a more streamlined fashion. 

So with that mindset, let me answer your queries in ways that seem logical to me.

1 You are allowed to go outside but not to roam about, police are told to let people go to stores and buy things. Just make sure you have a list and don't go to store to think and then decide. Try going to the closest store for things.

2 Ya people will hoard things, they already have.9pm to 12am last night people did that unnecessarily. But just understand this, these people will not come out again for the next 2 weeks at least. This means whatever comes in the next 3-4 days for the days upto the lockdown will be available for everyone. Yes, these will get out of stock quickly but be smart and buy for 2-3 days when you go out not much.  Its also the time to make creative and unorthodox meals from things you already have. It's the time to be socially responsible. One less milk pack you buy is a liter of milk for a family of 3. 

3 As announced essential goods will be available, factories and manufacturing units are allowed to be kept working if they make essential goods. Logistics supplying that is allowed to keep working. Ecommerce delivery is officially allowed so bigbasket etc should be able to get their shit sorted (but don't rely on them, buy local whenever you can). Some States even announced that police will help these trucks reach their destination. 

4 That crowd is going to be a problem at stores. Try going to stores close to you so you can rush back home and avoid crowds or people in general. Not the time to chit chat in person. You try your best to keep social distance. If you see a crowd gathered at stores, police are patrolling, call them and request them to force this crowd to obey social distancing. Thats the most you can do, I would recommend going out at times like 1-2pm when not many people will come out. Most people will come out a few hours before they know they want food. So less crowd hopefully. 

As soon as you come out clean up properly, hands, face, feet. Better yet take a good soapy shower. Clean your door knobs, doors, vehicle and all your contact points. Wash your bags when you get home. Take necessary precaution and you should be fine. This is the time to be paranoid but in a more rational way and not too much that it destroys your mental peace. Goood luck, take care and stay safe. Hang in there, don't panic.


Edit : fixed typos and grammar Very valid questions OP. People at the top are not thinking before making decisions. Junta curfew is a good branding exercise, total shutdown makes he leadership looks decisive. However making these decisions are easy if you haven't thought through all the repercussions. It is as easy as flipping a coin.

I just read that Flipkart has halted its service. Organizations like Flipkart, Amazon, Big Basket etc. are as essential as hospitals and labs right now. You can't just completely shut down people without giving them assurance and a clear plan for how you are going to deal with essential needs. The response has been completely bungled.

Do not be happy at shutdowns because that is primary instinct of our government. This time it ends up being the right decision but even if a shutdown was not needed we would go in a shutdown. This is the route the governments have taken for a long time. Ban, ban, ban, shutdown etc.

In my locality waste collection has been halted. Now I am not sure if it is to protect the workers collecting waste or if it is just a part of shutdown. It feels a little like Brexit means Brexit; shutdown means shutdown. We don't care what happens to you. We have made a decision and we will think about the repercussions later.

Truck drivers carrying goods are stranded in Punjab and Maharashtra. We know that because it has been reported. Because Shashi Tharoor tweeted. The police stops you, administration gives you instruction without telling you how to follow it. How to get through. Is there a website where I can go and see the list of all open essential services. How I can get food to feed myself if I had not indulged in panic buying as a responsible citizen? Who the fuck is downvoting this? Did I said anything wrong? My little sister is suffering with typhoid and all the autos and buses r closed I have activa and to my surprise police authorities closed our petrol pump now I don't have petrol also. Sach m ab dar lagra h. Next time, when it comes to election, don’t look at orchestrated hate campaigns and paki-fear mongering... instead vote for someone sensible with humane. Phewwww, What's your location?

How much stock do you have? Asking the real questions. Totally agree with the police part, yesterday evening in our area, cops beat up the vegetable vendors and people alike and forced them to leave. I mean we are allowed to go out and buy the essentials right? The only major problem i see here is people panic buying and hoarding stuff. There's not much that govt. Can do in this simoly because they don't have enough resources to manage all the rules and regulations it would require.

Its just that people can be so mean and selfish sometime that they forget other people also need the same things to survive.

Saw one guy buying 40KG of rice last week for a family of 3 When janta curfew was announced.
He was kinda boasting in front of his wife and other people that ""he is sorted"" he was feeling proud for doing that.
I doubt her wife asking him ""do we really need this much rice"".

The shopkeeper decalred some of the items out of stock soon after that.

The shopkeeper was kinda smart for not selling him everything, once the horder left he started providing groceries to other people who were waiting in queue.

At the end of the day, its us , the people who will help each other, not the govt, not the big corporations, not WHO or any organisation for that matter. I have the same concerns, I've not let the home for the past 2 weeks and now my meds are over. Look at how the government implemented demonatisation, do you think the government thinks about the consequences of their actions. The problem is our District Adminstrations . In demonitisation , banks atleast had a single order channel , here everyone district officals-police are doing as they deem fit. 

I don't even want to go out bcoz i don't want to deal with illterate Thullas explaining them govt. notifications. Problem is that police beating with lathis on sight. Let alone explaining them the reason for coming out. In Kerala citizens are asked to carry a self declaration form which gives the name , vehicle number if any , names of people accompanying,  purpose of visit , duration and when you will return. So if you're stopped you need to show this and they will let you on if convinced . Please petition your respective state governments to introduce a similar system

Second and additionally there may be order online home delivery services which have permission to operate .

Please try these.

Very sorry to hear about your plight . Go out to closest store and buy for a month like families do. Don't loitre around unnecessarily or pick a store to shop a km away.

Police are also humans and grover stores are open for public. Avoid crowding. I don't live in India right now, but speaking as someone who has been in quarantine for the last week and a half, here is what my experience has been:

\- I went grocery shopping once, went early, stocked up and came home and haven't gone since. There is no stipulation against going to the grocery store, just that everyone has to follow safe practices to do so. What this means for us here is having to maintain a safe distance from other shoppers, wearing gloves when handling produce, limiting the number of people in stores, etc.  
\- People did start hoarding things, and there were significant shortages at first. But this was only in the first week or so. Things got calmer after that and people stopped hoarding in the week since. Stores are much better stocked now, there's just an adjustment period at the very beginning.

\- Producing food is probably going to be an essential service and will be ongoing. People who work in food production (farming, factories etc) will also have to follow social distancing stipulations in order to minimize risk of spreading.

From what I've seen, it just takes some time for it to work itself out. Its very chaotic in the beginning because no one really knows what this is going to be like. People have definitely calmed down after a week or so and have gotten a chance to adjust to it. All the people who panic bought stupid shit and tried to hoard all the food stuffs are going to be dealing with piles of food they won't be able to eat before it goes bad. My biggest advice is to be sensible on this front especially. Don't hoard perishables. Don't hoard milk unless you want to be eating khoa for the rest of the year. Don't buy things you know your family won't eat. Don't panic if you can't get to the store right away, just try to manage as much as possible until you can get a chance to. Getting essentials is based on what your state government has decided to do. Visit their websites to get government orders. And if you do get stopped by the police tell them you are going out to get essentials. Try to step out only once a week. Freeze packets of milk and bread. Tomatoes, sweet corn, cucumbers and other veggies can be frozen too. The police heare one thing in TV , they understand something else and do something else. In my area lock down started 2 days before Janata curfew. CM clearly mentions food and vegetables should remain open. But somehow the policemen closed down all the vegetable shops in my area. the ultimately opened 2 days later after clarifications probably. i did not buy for a long time just for a week. Now just after Janata curfew i went to grocery store , most of the staples were gone. Normally they would get replenished quickly. But most wholesalers are closed. So i feel stupid for not stocking up. Luckily i managed got some stuff delivered before amazon closed down their delivery. That will tide me down 20 or so days. I cant imagine how daly wage earners are coping. >how can we buy the essentials

I believe their will be a notification of some dort to let us know about these stuffs

>People will simply hoard things.

I fear the same ..

>Where from the new food will come from?

Actually government generally maintains stock of crops and essential stuffs with them (I have read it somewhere that they allowed to distribute 6 months worth of stock) 

>will ensure more crowd

True this is what i also did thought (and hopefully we can get the answers of the same soon enough) Life is meaningless. Why would you say uneducated police? Such disrespect.",2020-03-25 05:26:22

https://youtu.be/uO74CWofkhs",give_me_sugar," With nothing to do, nothing to occupy your mind with, time moves painfully slowly and if you are even slightly hungry the feeling is maximized to the point that it is frustratingly desperate. People safe at home with enough food will eat more than they need due to this and run out food pretty fast. But even before that happens, people who are really hungry and abandoned by the government, what will they do? I know what I would do. Well the price you pay for being collectively docile. There's a guy who works as driver in my apartment, he has no house or anyone and lives in a garage. My mother was telling me that whatever we can do we should help him in these times. When we gave him food he told us that he slept hungry a day ago. I just cant imagine how many ppl r truly suffering during this pandemic. Gov is no help either, they just felt like putting a lockdown so they did, they didnt even think or prepare for it. Good luck everyone hope u all survive this pandemic. This is what I'm worried about, and that scene where >!the sister dies in the movie!< "" the grave of the fireflies"" flashes before me. 44% of under 5 kids are underweight, without proper nutrition they won't make it through, and they won't get proper nutrition when their parents are without income and away from home. This could have been well planned, but when has the government ever cared for the most vulnerable among us Many government State wise giving free food i think all the states should do such thing please Really sad. Imagine walking for more than 40 kms in the heat without food and water :( When will Modi learn to stop making shock announcements just to grab headlines and at least, in times of a national crisis, involve the state governments so that along with the CMs, can sit with the PMO and chart out a plan for the entire country. Mark my words, by day 14 there would be tons of suicide victims in India. The megalomaniac Gobiji and his support base don't care about the poor. Bookmarked, subha dekhuga I really cried watching this. I feel suffocated by my privilege and watching people around me be all ignorant, and feel victimised for the smallest of things. Don’t even know what to say - but such things flash before my eyes when I’m out for 300 rupee Starbucks latte. We all deserve hell for being blind to the plight of poor and I deserve the guilt. this will only going escalate so bad, might lead to famine Really tragic and unfortunate and government of all states can/should do a lot for these people. Some are doing what they can. More can be done.

BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO NOT LET MILLIONS DIE!

Please, be pragmatic and don't virtue signal by ""caring"" about poor on internet! It's pathetic.

> world is really unfair/ idk who to blame for all of this , smh

It always was, OP. Today it's just stark naked in front of everyone and bringing out ""moral"" philosophers who apparently need to shout ""Poor people are being fucked"" like it's breaking news.

We are way past ideals of just society or just leader or just government. It's time for being brutally pragmatic. Nothing from here onward will be clean or perfect fitting into our simplistic models.

Someone please make the people in this country shut the fuck up for suggesting that Modi should have first ""planned"" it out and then ordered the lock-down. Not taking such a drastic measure would be the decision that would eventually show everyone the true horrors (who knows, may be the worst is still coming our way with no way to avoid it). And no, it wasn't sudden or shocking. The 21-day lockdown did go out in stages with whatever planning a set of politicians can manage. Besides, this time it's not only Modi's or any his administration's decision; it's all the data, reports, and experts opinions on what the best step could be, including WHO.

Food,A Comprehensive Review on Rasam: A South Indian Traditional Functional Food - Agilandeswari Devarajan and M. K. Mohanmarugaraja,3,f3nv1p,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5628526/,3,,vv4life," Don't waste your time on it, because I have! As a big fan of rasam, I was excited to see this link. But what bullshit. The paper is a collection of random unsupported assertions, quotes from popular/recipe books, and assertions that Rasam has traditionally been used for one purpose of the other. I was hoping to see proof, but who needs proof when assertions are  sufficient.

Here is a quick sample:

""However, the concept of “*Unavae marunthu*” is at least 3500 years before Hippocrates (460–370 BCE)."" - At a minimum, the author should support with citation. But it is easier to assert about things that happened 1,500 BC than to cite!

""Rani and Paulraj, 2013, have reported that blood iron profile {snip} in anemic  patients was greatly influenced by dietary intervention with the  functional food Spirulina incorporated in *rasam*.\[[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5628526/#ref31)\]"" -- Sure, spirulina (which is a cyanobacteria) is rich in iron. Rasam has little to do with it, orange juice will do just as well, because it is about as acidic. And traditionally or otherwise, nobody adds cyanobacteria to rasam!

""A significant antimicrobial activity of *rasam* against *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Bacillus subtilis*, *Klebsiella Pneumoniae*, and *Escherichia coli* has been reported.\[[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5628526/#ref36)\]"" -- This is a lie. The cited article talks about some other 'chooranam'. The link is supposedly that some of the constituents of that chooranam are also present in rasam. The reference says nothing about antimicrobial activity of rasam, as the authors claim! Lying buggers. At this point I gave up in frustration. If I could choose my last meal, it would be rasam, rice and lemon pickle.",2020-02-14 13:57:50

To the best of my knowledge and assessment of the situation, we're about to get deluged in a wave of cases for which it is impossible to be adequately prepared. Many will die. The govt is trying, but whatever they arrange will never be enough for the general population to get off lightly. 

People panic buying food and medical supplies have created a vicious cycle so much so that I doubt if there will be enough meds for the frontline workers. This could potentially lead to more deaths in the healthcare workers, that could secondarily translate to a higher death rate in the patients.

People not taking quarantine seriously. Their actions today will kill many. Mostly their old, young, and sick family members, neighbours, or roommates.

In the meantime there's talk of having us work in makeshift corona wards from where we won't be able to return home. We'll probably stay on campus in recently emptied undergrad hostels. 

I don't mind working on campus and not coming home for weeks, maybe months. I don't mind dying too much either. ( I'm not super high-risk comorbidity-wise. I'm young. I run. But the stress is making me relapse into my smoking habit, and who knows what that might mean with this infection!) But the one thing that scares me shitless is that I don't know who will take care of my dogs at home. 

I hope I'm proved wrong in the coming weeks.

To negate the fatalism, if you're inside, avoiding ALL outside contact, you'll probably be able to delay infection to such time when we'll be better prepared to fight this thing with real world patient data, maybe new meds or even vaccines. Also death rates are generally low for young and fit patients.",bodhisattwax," Can you tell us a bit about the patients coming in? Are there a lot of covid 19 suspect cases that are turning up?

And please don't relapse into smoking. Form a group amongst the doctors there. Talking it out helps. What if we go outside to buy groceries (we haven't panic bought but supplies are depleting) and come back and take rigorous bath?

My mom went outside today, wearing gloves and a mask. She came back, kept the carry bags near the door (no one is allowed to touch it for a day) and bathed rigorously. Is that okay. 

We have completely sealed our houses from outsiders. Is it possible to volunteer to take care of your dogs in your absence? Something that has been very helpful to me lately is remembering that if my part to play in this pandemic is staying as much as possible in the comfort of my own home, I am an indecently lucky person who owes everything to the people on the front lines of this. Thank you so much and please take care of yourself. I am smoking waaaaayyy too much too. 💀 I work in power sector so I'll be working during the lockdowns too. Best of luck , hope to see you on the other side. Bro, I am scared that we are going to witness something very grim in the near future. Our Covid timeline is just 4 weeks behind that of USA. It's about to explode very soon. And once it explodes, God help us. It seems that the only way out of this nightmare is through. In these testing times, it's important not to base our conclusions in anecdotal stories and pure surmises. Unless there are personal accounts, it's irresponsible to spread hearsays. People must be patient and get info from legit sources and not panicked redditors. 

I've got no agenda here and hopefully no one feels triggered. Thank you for your service doc. While young and physically healthy make sure to take care of your mental health! Be strong. We appreciate you whether we express it or not. Do you think the number of cases are actually much larger than the ones being reported? We aren't testing at the level we should. Take care bro! Never lose hope! Can anyone not from the medical field volunteer in any possible way if you guys can teach us the basics of how to stay in gear and wash off properly? Jesus not many foreigners travel to india like they do to europe, americas, east Asia. You guys should chill out. Small states in US have more cases than entire south asia. You guys will be fine. Just take precautions obviously but dont freak out. Its growing very very slowly in india Plus there’s travel ban as well. You all guys are doing a great work there. God bless you all. Please keep us updated. Thanks for everything you are doing.  
I have a question. I am living by myself in isolation. No housemate or family. Can my friend, who also has been in isolation and lives 5 mins (walking) away visit me? Solitary confinement is making me very anxious, and this would seriously help the both of us. How risky is it? Hugs to you my friend. And good luck. Some epidemiologists say we are already in the third phase Is that true??What do you think for how long our battle will continue?Do you think India is gonna face more deaths than Italy considering greater number of illiterates also India is 20 times bigger than Italy?( our preventive measures are far more superior till now tho)Stay well✌💓 Are we testing patients now who might have acquired virus through community transfer? What should people with pre-existing conditions do? So if I stay inside and avoid all contact,even then I am just delaying the inevitable? Oh man.How does that negate the fatalism? Thank you for your service doc. And hope to see you on the other side of this, fit and fine. Did the clapping at 5 pm make you feel good, personally? >Many will die. The govt is trying, but whatever they arrange will never be enough for the general population to get off lightly. 

i HIGHLY doubt the government tried or is trying. Instead, the murderer who occupies the highest post in the country encourages histrionics.

Every time someone asked me why i keep saying India is doomed, this is why. Whenever you feel like smoking drink some water instead and also you can make a fist with your hand and inhale air through it and it could help the cravings.

If you are ready to quit this may help you cut down or quit smoking altogether.

Thanks for sharing about the situation. I'm praying God be with you through this. Hey doc I have friends living in Worli(Bombay) slums and would be really helpful if you could suggest something precautionary measure to prevent and identify at earliest the disease. Thanks for your service ! Hello sir , any way to help you guys get the masks /medical equipments ? 

Or is there a shortage on national level and scope of importing them is very less .

Many of us can instantly provide funds , though i feel that would be a small amount :( Can the mods actually verify this guy is a real doctor? > y'all

first time I hear that from an indian LOL Sending strength and positive vibes to you! Bruh... You're doing great... These people don't understand the seriousness of the disease... The whole clapping episode was for the encouragement of doctors and health care workers... But these people made it like a fest... That wasn't the idea... It's only gonna worsen....
Either way mate... You're doing great Hello Doctors,

Soon, we are going to run out of masks and gloves, but all healthcare workers need FULL HAZMAT SUITS to protect themselves.

I wasted so much money in these apps because I felt hungry and instead of looking for an alternative I just ordered either fancy food or cheap foods( Due to their attractive 50% offers). 



See the budget for alternatives like

Maggi (Rs 12)
Eggs (Rs 5-7)
Bread (Rs 30)
Tomato sauce large ( Rs 100)
Mayoneese large(Rs 110)
Chilly sauce large (Rs 110)
Rice Batter (Rs 40/kg) with Idly powder(Rs 10)[For South Indians]
Butter (Rs 50-150)
Milk (500 ml for Rs 25)
Peanut Butter (Rs 70)
Any Health mix/syrups
Frozen French Fries ( Rs 250/kg)




With these items you can make small dishes like 

Egg maggi
Bread omelette
Bread toast
Butter toast
Normal omelettes
Egg popcorn 


Although this may sound popular,it helps you to avoid ordering at late nights if you go for these alternatives or else you might end up spending Rs 150 for your cravings.",Srivignesh3797," True , I have just uninstalled the apps. I jus make fried egg or eat a piece of chocolate if I feel tempted.
Also I imagine (as a joke) how gross the hygiene level of the place would be or someone sneezing on my food or something. Then I am adequately put off.
You are right OP, it saves tonnes of money. Dude, no matter where you are in the world, cooking at home is always waaaaaaay cheaper and healthier than eating out. My mom always prefers cooking at home to eating out and I didn't get why that was about until I started eating out.

OTOH, food business is hard work, but it has super good margins, especially in India where even the least tasty stall will also make money. Hi dad. Thanks mom Most of the times we are bored and a friend just exclaims he has a discount offer. Is true. I've saved a lot of money by learning how to make small food items.

This is only the tip of iceberg as far as corruption in army is concerned. I can confirm this from personal experience.

Food,Randians please suggest Cancer treatment related comfort foods and accessories available in India.,26,etatxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/etatxn/randians_please_suggest_cancer_treatment_related/,3,My mother’s chemotherapy sessions start in a few days. I want to be prepared in terms of providing her all the comforts. What should I buy?,rottenTampon," Signed up just to comment here. 

1. chemotherapy side effects will vary with every person. 

Common side effects include nausea, hair loss, neuropathy and general weakness in body. 

Some of these side effects can be managed, and managed well with the kind of medication available now. 

Diet is going to play a major role. The days immediately after chemo, her mouth will have possible ulcers, her taste buds will go hay wire. Try and check with her, her comfort levels with respect to food. 

For my mom, we started the day with tender coconut water. Its one of the best when it comes to providing energy and soothing to the stomach. The jelly like coconut, very early stage is also in our experience good for the ulcers in mouth. 

Pomegranate juice was another near constant in my moms diet. 


Her platelet count will take a dive. So check with you doc for papaya leaf extract as a fall back. 

Greens like drum stick leaves also helped. 


If she does have hair fall, consider getting her a nice wig. It helps a lot psychologically. 

Above all, just give her the confidence that you are all there. Cancer treatment, especially Chemo is a very psychologically taxing regimen. You need every ounce of mental strength to get through it. 

All the best! Comfort food: your love

Comfort accessory: your time. 

These are best options, and guess what- they're free of cost. I read kiwi is good for patients in such time.",2020-01-24 22:05:51

Our country has lot of unique issues that are simply not there in developed countries.",voyagebeyond2020," I think at this rate we have a couple of months before we reach the tipping point. If we are to reach that situation the basic stuff like water/milk/wheat and rice will be rationed for households. You can’t buy more than a particular quantity. 

Army might be involved to force the law. This is what happens during a war. There will be more severe rules on movement and larger punishments for hoarding. 
Hospitals will be overrun and there will be volunteers coming to help out the already strained medical establishment. 

But let’s hope we don’t get there. Stay indoors and let’s flatten the curve. Rich will probably survive with money.



Middle class will probably survive with money and grace of God.


Poor will probably survive with the grace of God.





God doesn't exist . End of thread . If you have home in rural area go there, grow your own produce, isolate yourself from others. you have to go full caveman, at some point it you have to survive until everything cools down. The PDS system serves low income groups. Any ration card holder can still get subsidized rice or sugar. This is how it works in TN. TN also has Amma grocery shops. we die Whenever I think of that I imagine this scenario playing out in a time when there are no cellphones and Internet. It's a tough situation  right now but still infinitely better than what it would have been say 30 years back. The percentage on my flair will reach 100. Don't worry. Nothing will happen. I don't like BJP but I am sure they will not let this happen. State government will provide food services door to door (most probably) People who have the ability to grow their own food may be in a better position - like in a decently sized kitchen garden. Rice, dal, beans are easier to store for months and years. I believe we have enough macronutrients for all.

>The purpose of this conceptual paper is to provide readers with an opportunity to reassess their work and life in the face of an inevitable near-term social collapse due to climate change.

Hastening of collapse of industrial civilization. If we accept it and adapt, we may survive the climate apocalypse. I am afraid this event will completely turn our attention from climate change which is a far bigger existential crisis but does not kill as quickly as a virus. Mad max india edition. If the spread of virus is not curtailed, the lockdowns would open, they would have to, otherwise we would start killing each other. 

The disease would spread, we will get sick, medicate and get better and with rise of temperatures, we will eventually defeat this.

In the worst case scenario, there will be total break down of healthcare - as the system would be overwhelmed, so mortality rate will rise. Even for non-corona related cases. 

I don't see us rioting, we will find a way. In the extremest of extreme cases, there would be millions of sick people, who would get better and join back the world. Every nation is going to have this dilemma. A hard recession will be terrible & might kill more.

What are their plans, exactly to meet the upcoming crunch for medical services? Does anyone know? As long as Dmart can keep the supplies rolling we got nothing to worry about, once Dmart runs out of stock.. well i hope that doesn't happen. I just hope the government works on a delivery system for rations. Packets of cluster cases form,easier to isolate and manage than people with no sense of savings for rainy days running willy nilly everywhere hunting for their next paisa to gulp down on booze

Slowly relaxing lockdown on the rest of the places while isolating the clusters.The only thing required is for general people to not fuck this up which a lot of the woke folks with a sense of false entitlement seem to be doing. 28 days later.

Food,[Stupid but serious question] Won't there be a point where loss of life and economy due to lockdown will be greater than loss of life due to coronavirus?,154,fnizym,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnizym/stupid_but_serious_question_wont_there_be_a_point/,63,"I am from West Bengal. And honestly, the lockdown is scaring me really bad. The prices of food items like potatoes, tomatoes, etc have risen significantly, or the supplies are almost finished. Many shops which sell basic groceries are closed and their owners say they are afraid if they will be arrested by the police even though groceries have been exempted. Even though I am from a middle class family, I know many low income families who are more paranoid about this situation. If people don't get to eat, they will die from hunger anyways.

I don't know about Economics, but is there a possibility that people might die more because of the lockdown rather than coronavirus? Many vegetables are absolutely finished in our local markets, and given that most vegetables, meat, etc come through local trains which are now non-operational, how will we get basic stuff like food? From what I know, poor people still have ration card to meet their requirements, and rich people, well, have their money to get through the system. What about most of us? 

Another thing is jobs. Due to these shutdowns, the businesses will face huge losses, jobs like hawkers, small shops, cottage industries, chaiwala, panwala, panipuriwala, etc will mostly go without any money. And if this lockdown is extended, which it most probably will, won't several million people just die due to lack of money and food?

Edit: I sometimes go on Libertarian sub (curiosity) and there someone said this that the population cannot sustain this and that this can be solved by just quarantining the old people and nothing else, i.e., no lockdown or travel ban or anything, just quarantining of old people because Covid 19 apparently doesn't harm young people. Is this really a sound solution?",Death1s1nevitable," The price rise is a bullwhip effect. Everyone is stocking up now, so there are some shortages. In a week to 10 days, there will be surplus because noone will be buying at the time.

Yes, life for poorer people is going to be very very difficult.

However, hopefully people will learn that a lockdown is not a curfew. There is no restriction n going out for essential purposes and neither is there any closure of essential services. Hopefully we will be able to develop a rythm

Economy wise of course, things are going to be very very bad. Not a stupid question. It's a really important question. I don't know too much about it, but essential items include food items and groceries, so inter-state transport of these stuff is allowed.

Centre and state should announce a DBT to the poorer people soon, to compensate for loss of work. And also make available groceries as well. Neither can they work, nor do they have money. Kerala has announced that groceries would be available. Similarly Delhi has announced the same. Centre needs to augment the states with similar stimulus package. They should, in theory, be able to help out the poorer strata. The civil society organisations as well as private industries should also help out in this manner. Adopt a district or a village or couple of families. We can help oit as well.

It's gonna be a rough couple of years for Modi and his cabinet. The economy was already on a downslide, it could go into free fall soon. We need to inject state money into the market sooner rather than later.

And since it's a contagious disease, loss of lives due to illness would inevitably be larger than loss of lives due to lack of food or lack of money, if unfettered movement continues. Look at Italy. They went about normally around their days and they're fucked. And also, the poor strata would be disproportionately affected due to COVID as well. I can afford to go to a private hospital for treatment, the poor cannot. 

Lockdown is just more effective to contain COVID. And like always, poor are collateral damage. It's not a stupid question. It will impact or already has, around the world its not only our country. There will be a ripple effect across industries those money muscle might even close. It will recover with time as with any calamity. Dude if there's no lockdown , there won't be any economy left . Maybe not, I mean China and South korea managed to contain by observing strict quarantines. It's definitely possible. There are two important points one is loss of life and resources the second and probably more devastating is the breaking up of supply chains.
The first one in a young population is quite maintainable and we could probably have lost a few million people and no one would bat an eye but the second one is much more devastating.
Let's say the goverment does not lockdown and in a few months we have those millions death I talked about before.Then it spreads rapidly, causing people to drop out of work, panic buy and hoard in turn caussing essential services to shut down. Population becomes aggrresive and downright uncontrollable that's when we lose trillions of dollars in economic impact and many many millions more people due to food shortage, distribution problems and in general lack of essential services. 
Note: Increased cases also mean our health infrastructure crumble as professional start getting sick and scared causing them to run away from work. about your edit: it effects every one. Even the young have died from it. I saw a post of  a doctor who helplessly saw one his 24M patient die gasping for air.

&#x200B;

Currently the thought process goes like, we will rebuild the economy if we live to see it through. I think your question from the libertarian sub is explained here

https://youtu.be/ofSLpDQx1bA?t=422

Basically even if you just lock up the at risk population, the number of death will be still damn high. Also its not like healthy young adults are completely ""immune"" to the worst effects of disease. 

By the end of the year I'm sure some other disease will be the largest cause of death but Covid-19 will have killed more in a shorter time span while bringing the healthcare system to its knees. The loss of lives if there are zero checks would be scales of magnitude higher than if there is a lockdown.

There's a great study by the Financial Times on this.
 https://mobile.twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1240629424871047168

With zero checks, the US death toll would be 2.2 million. You can imagine how bad it would be in India.

Containment is the only option. Yes, it will hurt millions in the short term, but there's no other option. if there is no lockdown, then the cases will reach thousands and then economy will be worse than what it is after lockdown. we don't have infra to treat thousands at the same time in a country of 1.3 billion people. Things can we avoided easily if the state government array facilities where people can easily buy supplies from home. I don't know about west Bengal but I live in Delhi and haven't left my mouse for anything for supplies for months :3

everything online :) >Covid 19 apparently doesn't harm young people


No. Young people can also die but the fatality rate is lower. https://youtu.be/CvlU-Yqf-EM The government is responsible for both keeping us alive and keeping the economy stable. They are doing what seems to be the best option. That is not a stupid question at all. All governments around the world, have to balance this question. We know about a new virus when China reported it to the WHO on Dec 31, 2019. By Jan 20, 2020, China announced there was clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. 

So what did every government in the world do since Jan 20? 

In America, we were still debating whether to shut down restaurants and bars, as well as cancel large scale events as recently as **last week**. This is despite the US already giving classified briefings to Senators and the President as early as in January. 

I can't say what the Italians, Spanish, etc., have done, but I doubt their reaction is any better than America's reaction. a quick stupid question 


Should I write my java observation records or not ? If you don't lock down, people will fall sick like flies and die very quickly. The current estimates of thousands dying in India are based on the measures taken so far. If you don't do that, you'll have millions dying. With that, the economy will collapse anyway. Locking down is the least bad option. There is a piece by Madhavkunty Pillai in the Open magazine just on this point. Go through it. you are absolutely right, creating panic about the threat of coronavirus is a double edged sword. While it helps to ensure that people take precautions, it also can have many side effects. Rather , people should be made calmer and made to realise the fact that there's only 4% chance of death even if someone catches the virus. Unnecessary fear and excessive restrictions can cause economic recessions and productivity loss.

If situation is intelligently tackled, everyone can survive. I'd recommend that really everyone should volunteer in these tough times to increase food production , logistics and supply because everyone is pretty free these days because of lack of work. 

The only hope for poor is if government decides to use country's reserve to import food or some billionaire decides to become humanitarian. Well Corona virus does affect young people as well and even if the young people dont die, they will have the virus and keep spreading...and stopping the virus from spreading would be impossible... and eventually all older people will be affected... we can just stay quarantined for 2-3weeks instead,if that breaks the spread of the virus and stops it from spreading. Too many infections and there wouldn't be an economy left to save. people don't value things equally over a period of time. People value things that are immediate more than things that are in future. In a sense future utils are *discounted*. So the immediate loss is more hurtful to us than the future losses. Lookup discounted utility. Honestly I am against this lockdown for this reason , it's going to make our life worse , india should have gone for herd immunity . Our nation can't afford it . Lockdown is making people more  paranoid . Coronavirus is the first thing. When it spreads, the hospitals will be overwhelmed and without medication, the mortality rate would be around 10%. Lack of food and medicines will cause riots which will again be based on religion and discriminate against north east members of our countries. If you let the virus spread spread to save the economy or you enforce lockdown, the economy will collapse anyways. Good luck You aren't wrong and there is no trivial answer to your question. Fortunately, some folks in the state/central administration/governments did think this through and figured out the correct solution : Providing free food for all. 

For the next couple of months, the poor get distributed free rations. So, no deaths from hunger and no deaths from the virus.

> I sometimes go on Libertarian sub (curiosity) and there someone said this that the population cannot sustain this and that this can be solved by just quarantining the old people and nothing else, i.e., no lockdown or travel ban or anything, just quarantining of old people because Covid 19 apparently doesn't harm young people. Is this really a sound solution?

No. One, wrong premise. Covid 19 does harm young people. Two, sooner or later, if the virus keeps on propagating, the elders will lose their patience and come in contact with the youth. Having a 15 day quarantine is feasible, almost just about, having a six month quarantine simply isn't practical, even for the old. yes. just like the number of criminals affected by demonetisation was far lesser than innocents in the unorganized sector.

here too, the rich brought the virus to India. the rich will survive, the poor will not. What you have stated is a very logical conclusion. It isn't a stupid question instead a very valid. Lockdown is a limited resource as it comes with great economic, and should have been used carefully instead now it is being wasted. Without testing of patients and isolating them, lockdown will do little to contain the disease. Lockdown will have to be lifted soon unless a lot more people will die from poverty, starvation, avoidable diseases than Covid would kill. Is this Donald Trump?",2020-03-23 20:17:44

Same chutiya group support the pro-Nazi groups in hating Muslims and ""halal"" food. Foreign me bhi ye hutiyapa Shuru ho gaya. Oh man..we are just f*cking bunch of parasites spreading shits wherever we go... They happily go and eat in german restaurants selling beef, they suck upto beef eating Germans..but if their own people sells beef or eat beef, then they go nutsss...! Hypocrites...! This reminds me of that Hasan Minaj bit where he compares the Indian diaspora to a biryani ""Keep the weird shit out and bring the good stuff in"" Objection on beef in Germany? Motherfuckers, this is the land of beef and pork. Fuckers, go back to India. Why the fuck are you even in Germany? Go back inside Modi's arse and eat dhokla. I suppose they were serving Porota Beef.
No one comes in between a Malayali and his porota beef. FFS I'm hindu and those assholes don't represent me. Just like the Taliban doesn't represent Muslims. Anyone can eat what they want. Honestly I would stand with these guys and tell those wound ups to fuck right off Objecting beef in Germany? Lol, these guys are unbelievable. If you can't tolerate people with different eating habits, maybe you shouldn't be living in places where people have different eating habits than you. Just stay home back in India if you're so close minded. This is is stupid , if you dont wanna eat then dont eat the beef , why restricting others bc puri duniya k samne ijaat ka kachra kar rahe hai ye narrow minded bhadwe. How much common sense can anyone lack to understand food pyramid, human history and HUMANITY. Keep crying bitch supreme leader modi doesn't have jurisdiction in Germany Well the Malayalis should have boycotted the event. Fuck these RW nuts. Why such compulsion?? If you don’t like beef don’t eat it! Let others enjoy! 😑 Aise log India ko har jagah badnaam krte hai. Germany jaakr bhi berozgaar ho to isse acha vapis aa jao. These assholes can't leave people in peace anywhere in god damn world. Don't go and settle in beef eating countries. Oh that would be India, the country you left in the first place. Now sanghi pigs have started spreading their cancer abroad. Idiots protesting other idiots.

Its an ""Indian"" food fest. Not a ""Hindu"" food fest.  25% of Indians have no prohibition against beef and do eat beef.

What moronic times we live in. Just so you guys know it's part of Hindu Culture to eat beef. Sad day - CGI Germany bowed down to goons Maybe they should come right back. Bitches These extremists don't decide what is Indian culture.  There are several states where beef is eaten.

""Kerala, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura and West Bengal are the states where there are no restrictions on cow slaughter.""

Indian culture isn't based on what a majority does either. If that is the case then lynchings would also have to be considered as an Indian culture. 

In the case of beef Some Indians eat it some don't. So if you are a part of India you can't say that your country doesn't eat beef. If you want to say that then you aren't talking about India anymore.

It isn't against Indian culture to eat beef.

It isn't against Hinduism to eat beef either. Because there are many texts that show that beef was consumed by hindus for years. The most these extremists can say it is that their political parties and groups don't eat beef, ie bjp,rss,etc. Go mallus!✨😂 > However, some right-wing Hindu organisations raised objections over the menu, saying that serving beef was a ""direct attack on Indian culture"" and **threatened to create a ruckus during the festival.**

Clear case of CGI Frankfurt getting bogged down by what can be called terrorists or atleast mafia Do these north Indians never visit a German resturant, or drive out Germans from other food fairs where I'm pretty sure some beef would be common?. Oh no. There they must integrate and be diverse. Yeah just when we have ou diverse culture on display, they want it shudh shakahari. Not in a non nazi regime my aryans. What are these idiots doing outside the country then?? Fuckers... Come back to your UP style Yogi-rajya if you want to follow your version of shuddh indian culture.

Fucktards. From what I know of cultural/food festivals, foreign embassies ask their expatriates to present the culture of their home country in the form of food, movies, books, drama, souvenirs to the natives. It is a way for the natives(Germans in this case), to experience the culture of other countries(India). 

Sanghis objected to Kerala stall serving beef as though Kerala culture cannot be presented to the Germans as Indian food. 

You can be sure that Sanghis would have also exercised control through their thug organisations to decide what movies and books would have been presented to the Germans.

It is important to understand this larger fight of control over what defines India, rather than look at this as just another instance of Sanghis preventing Keralites consuming beef. The event was called ""Indian Vegetarian Food Fest"". Here is the coverage from German national broadcaster: https://m.dw.com/hi/%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AF-%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%95/g-50275074

 Indian embassy organized that in remembrance of 150 years of Gandhi.

I don't understand why this protest when the event was openly called vegetarian food festival. Here's the reason why malayalis/Keralites whatever u prefer are protesting.  Ig as a Malayali I can speak for

FACTS :- 1)  NRI's in Germany are mostly Malayali's like most of the NRI's in Singapore are from Tamil Nadu and Punjabi's in Canada.

 2) Hindu/Christian/Muslim/Areligious  Malayali's eat beef in general in Kerala since it's one of the only States where beef (cow meat)  is legal. 

REASON :-  Quite simple they feel their preferences are being ignored coz Christian's eat all poultry meats, Hindu's don't eat beef, Muslims don't eat pork. You see where I am getting at? You can't satisfy everyone so it leads to conflict. 

Why is it happening now? Increase in population of Muslim/Christian NRI's in Germany. 

Can we enjoy diversity in peace? No coz diversity always leads to conflict no matter how optimistic you're. [deleted]",2019-09-03 00:44:06

If anyone has any news of the progress (if any) in this direction, I would be glad to hear about it. For a normal human 1 year= 365 days. But for a yogi, 1 normal human year is nothing. I yogi year= at least a millennia of normal human years.

Legends: बिना परमीशन छाैरे का हाथ पकडें हरियाणा राेडवेज में Second gf ko first time milne ka story




2nd year just shuru hua tha. Train se safar kar raha tha for college. I was alloted a lower berth. The other three berths were alloted to a girl(let's call her K) and her grandparents. K and her grandparents had a lot of luggage so initially I helped them out in putting their luggage beneath the berths. The train started its journey and K went on the upper berth to sleep. K bsdk neeche hi nahi aa rahi thi ab mai karu toh karu kya, bolun toh bolun kya. Grandparents ke saath kaafi saara socialize karke mann ko behlaa liya. Grandparents got impressed with my college and started opening up and started talking about K. Grandparents also shared their food with me, aloo ki subzi, daal - chawal and roti. Lekin as kismat would have it, K was in her berth Sleeping and using her phone the whole time.




Ab ho gaya raat ka samay. Agyakaari aagayehumbhi ne apna lower berth nani ji ko de diya and upper berth le liya. Bitch K is still inside her quilt on her phone. aagayehumbhi ne bhi phone pe timepass karne ka socha. But as kismat would have it, phone mei jyada battery nahi thi. Aur bsdk maine charger bhi nahi laaya tha. K ka phone charging pe lagaa hua tha and she was asleep. There is only one charging point in train on the upper side(in the middle). Ab mai bhikmangaa toh hu toh maine chupchaap se uska phone nikaala and mera lagaa diya. Paanch minute baad she gets up and sees that her phone is plugged out. I tell her my duvidha and she says karlo use. Mauke pe chauka maarte hue aagayehumbhi cracks a small joke and she chuckles. Then she cracks a follow up not-so-funny joke but humne formality mei Hass diya. The socializing which I did with Nani-nani helped me a lot to hold and carry the conversation further. We talked for the whole night throughout the journey. Two people, on the upper berth of the compartment in the middle of nowhere, talked about anything and everything. Beech mei nani used to wake up and she would shush us and we would stay quiet and then start talking again. One of the best nights of my life.




The next day, we reached our destination. I helped them with their luggage and auto. K and I shaked hands. And then I started walking towards the taxi stand. 2 mins later K was shouting my name and she was running towards me and she eventually asks my number. Proper movie scene ban sakta tha ye. I wasn't expecting to keep contact as we lived 250 kms apart. But I gave her my number. Uske baad roz baatein and then we eventually started dating. 




TLDR: Second gf ka story, after the popularity of first gf ka story. A 'Jab we met' type Bollywood story. :) Recently moved to Mumbai for a new job. It's been one month and I still haven't made any friends. I eat my breakfast lunch dinner alone in the company and it had started taking a toll on me.

u/Buntyfrompremnagar : haan ek fruit chaat bana de mujhe bhi iski **Death grip syndrome**

The term ""death grip,"" as it pertains to masturbation, was originally coined by the pioneering sex columnist Dan Savage. ""It refers to men that masturbate with an overly tight grip on their penises—or in any fashion that applies a LOT of pressure, like humping a mattress—who later go on to have difficulty orgasming during partner sex,” explains Sarah Martin, MA, a certified sex coach. It can also lead to an inability to orgasm and issues maintaining erections.

This means you might be gripping your penis with your hand so tightly, that having sex with a partner (intercourse, oral, etc.) can feel unexciting or under-stimulating for you. Let’s be real, a vagina or mouth is never going to be as tight as a hand. This is just science.

If you want to get around the adverse effects of death grip, you have to change the way you masturbate. Of course, this is a simple answer to a not-so-simple problem.

Martin says, “Practice solo! When masturbating, use a light touch and use lube. Focus on what feels good.” This might leave you frustrated at first, but try to remember this isn’t an easy fix. Teaching you body to enjoy new and less intense stimulation will take time and patience.

As for what lube to try, we love Cocolube. It’s all-natural, long-lasting, and helps increase sensitivity. You could also experiment with Foria—CBD lubricants that are usually used to increase blood flow to the clitoris. It can do the same for penises! #Death grip syndrome

As for what lube to try, we love diarhhoea. It’s all-natural, long-lasting, and helps increase sensitivity. You could also experiment with castrol lubricants that are usually used to increase flow to the pistons. It can do the same for penises! [deleted] My room's got few black ants roaming here n there.

u/KyaReNaina u/kyareanjali कोई हमदम ना रहा कोई सहारा ना रहा

हम किसी के ना रहे कोई हमारा ना रहा Quite amazing how thots can weigh u down & set u free. All else is restricted by its physicality. Freedom is just a thot & so is confinement Such a slow, dull day. Kisi chiz ko tum bar bar dekhte ho to unconsciously wo tumhare dimag me baith jati hai. Interview k time jab mujhe ek enthusiasm k Saath passionate word use Krna tha to mujhe 'zeal' hi dimag me aaya Clevinger had a mind, and Lieutenant Scheisskopf had noticed that people with minds tended to get pretty smart at times. Such men were dangerous, and even the new cadet officers whom Clevinger had helped into office were eager to give damning testimony against him. The case against Clevinger was open and shut.
The only thing missing was something to charge him with. This is my 3rd time on this thread. The amount of hmmmmmmmmm is jarring I don’t really care if u/Buntyfrompremnagar ever shit posts again. The mere fact that he continues to bring high level, beautiful, out of the ordinary shit posting to my reddit feed, at the age of 23, is reason enough for me to root for him to continue shit posting as long as *he* wants to grace this presence. 

Bunty is one of the most deliberate, methodical, thoughtful shit poster to grace  reddit. If he didn’t believe he could continue to shit post at a level that’s high enough for him to whore karma, he’d have pulled the plug on his career. The fact that he’s excited ought to keep us excited, FFS. Another victory against exams.

Not fuck, like in those movies. Not even have sex. Just sleep together in the most innocent sense of the phrase. But I lacked the courage and she had a bf  and I was gawky and she was gorgeous and I was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating. So I walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk, thinking that if people were rain, I was drizzle and she was hurricane.

For some it is the hardest thing to achieve. 

若者として仕事の世界に侵入するのは必ずしも簡単ではありません。仕事に就くべきだと言う声が不足しているわけではありませんが、その理由はそれだけではありません。努力するだけの価値があるのか​​、そうでない人よりも実際に仕事をしている人の方が良いのかと疑問に思うかもしれません。以下は、あなたの現金のレベル、健康、または将来の機会にかかわらず、就職することが良い主な理由のいくつかです。



なぜ仕事に就く必要があるのですか？
もっとお金
仕事の最も明確な利点は、それに付随するお金です。これは明らかな点のように思えるかもしれませんが、収入の安定した流れを維持することの価値を過小評価しないでください。週給は、今日の家賃と費用を賄うだけではありません。明日も補償されるようにするための最良の方法です。



あなたが仕事を得ることができない場合、州は求職者の支払いを通じてあなたの基本的なニーズを満たすためにお金を提供します。しかし、これらの支払いはあなたが仕事で稼ぐものと比較して低く、常に仕事に目を光らせていることに依存しています。これは特に若い人たちに当てはまります。26歳未満の場合、福祉の割合がはるかに低くなります。



仕事を提供されたことがあるのに、福祉にとどまるよりも給料のほうが良いかどうかわからない場合は、Benefit of Work準備計算ツールを使用できます。仕事中の税金と福利厚生を計算し、仕事で本当に稼げるお金と求職者の支払いで得られる金額を比較します。あなたの潜在的な雇用者が少なくとも最低賃金を提供している限り、準備ができている計算機はあなたが仕事を取ることの利益をあなたに示すべきです。



雇用されていることの健康上の利点
仕事をすることはあなたにとって良いことです。仕事の条件が公平で、危険な環境で働いていない限り、雇用は精神的および肉体的な健康に役立ちます。仕事をしていると、日々の目的が与えられ、自尊心が高まります。また、あなた自身よりも大きな何かに貢献するための明確で直接的な方法を提供します。それがビジネスであれ、経済であれ、社会全体であれ。自分に目的があり、世界に貢献していると感じるなら、幸せで自己実現した人になるのはずっと簡単です。



雇用はまた、あなたの時間を構成し、人々と出会う機会を与え、理想的には仕事に満足していると感じることができるという点で、メンタルヘルスにも適しています。また、借金に陥りにくくなり、また、目標を達成することについてストレスを感じることも少なくなります。どちらも健康に大きな影響を与える可能性があります。また、職場にいる人々は、平均よりも若い年齢で有害な嗜癖を発症したり、落ち込んだり、死亡したりする可能性が低くなります。



セキュリティと今後の展望
残りの人生で何をしたいのか正確にはわからないかもしれませんが、おそらくあなたが住みたい場所の種類、時間を過ごしたい趣味などについてある程度知っているでしょう。仕事をすることで、自分の将来の計画を立てやすくなり、自分で設定した目標に向かって取り組むことが容易になります。安定した信頼できる収入は、現在について心配することを止め、あなたの将来に集中するために必要な安全を与えます。



すべての仕事が安全で長続きするわけではありませんが、仕事をするたびに次の仕事を手に入れるのが簡単になるはずです。雇用の歴史を築くと、より強い履歴書が得られます。これにより、より良い、より高給の仕事に取りかかることが容易になります。すべての仕事はあなたの次の仕事への足がかりになる可能性があり、あなたが持っているそれぞれがあなたが本当に愛するもの、またはあなたが別の情熱を追求するためのリソースを提供するものに一歩近づくことができます。

Food,When you gotta do the social distance...,454,foll8p,https://i.redd.it/s1lo8s1ckro41.jpg,19,,marrmalayde," bless your friend's soul! My friend feeds these cute strays everyday. Now she’s getting them to do the social distance. I used to feed strays near my building but due to lack of supplies it is extremely difficult now. A lot of other people also used to come feed those doggos here, but I've been growing worried if they are being fed now. 

Even if I get their food from somewhere, little scared that the cops might start hitting me for being out of the house. Good bois This reminds me of dogs in our office campus who live on biscuits fed to them by people in campus. They are gonna have a difficult time with people not coming to campus due to lockdown. Good bois with good habits Your friend is an an angel. Damn I wish I had bought some dog food before everything closed Proceeds to lick the butthole of the other dog after eating the food... hey hey look !!

Food,I live in a hostel and I am going to spend the next 2-3 weeks only in my room during the lockdown. I am going to shop/market for the final time. Suggest some things which could be helpful to me during the lockdown.,60,fnex6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnex6b/i_live_in_a_hostel_and_i_am_going_to_spend_the/,59,"The most important thing which I need is food.I don't want to rely on the zomato/swiggy so I am planning to stock some packets of maggies and few snacks. I don't know what should I include more. 

-I have a good internet connection.
-3 mobile phones and a laptop.
-An induction cooker.

The only problem  I will face is of food. Suggest me guys.",Devoid29," Ready to eat foods from MTR - They have Umpa, Poha, Idli mixes

Then you have Maggie, Pastas

Eggs, Spreads like PB, Jelly, Nutella

Biscuits > \-I have a good internet connection. -3 mobile phones and a laptop 

What's with the 3 mobile and laptop thing? You can only use ""ONE AT A TIME"" Oats, flattened rice, maggi taste maker and salt. You don't have to make noodles just use the taste maker on other stuff. Milk powder, boost for longer shelf life. You need Kellogg's cereal , milk powder , some fresh fruits for the initial days , eggs (they last for a week or so) ,bread (for the initial days), ready to eat stuff from MTR , biscuits like Marie gold and Parle G, rice ,dal ,oats ,tea 

It doesn't matter how much you stock up , you would have to get supplies again after a week 
I would suggest you to use big basket daily or apps like that they deliver on a regular basis before 7 AM in the morning. Peanut Butter, any bread, some snacks. Try to learn the basics of nutrition. You need carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals and fiber. Most easy items only contain carbs, e.g.:

1. Maggi.
2. Bread.
3. Pasta/noodles.
4. Jam and many other spreads like Jelly, Nutella.
5. Biscuits (may contain a little bit of fiber).
6. Cereal (may contain a little bit of fiber).
7. Tang/fruit juice (even natural or home made ones).
8. Fruits (contains vitamins and minerals). Have fruits in limited quantities for the vitamins. 
9. White rice.

A diet consisting only of carbs for a long period is very dangerous. Essential medicines like paracetamol, montair lc, pudin hara.
Beer
Joint OP add some dry fruits and nuts like cashew almond, dates, walnut.

Pulses channa, Dal, Rajma, green gram.

Ragi, horse gram, amaranth seeds. 

These are very easy to make see YouTube you just need to boil them correctly. you don't need to make at channa masala level. But if you it's good. Don't rely only on Maggi as it won't have essential nutrients. Don't order, It might take time.

Get it from a nearby shop ASAP! 

u/ppccbba can help you with the list (Jokes apart) Ready to eat items You say you live in a hostel. Is it like a working men's hostel or a student hostel? If it is the latter, then it is the responsibility of the institute to provide you with food, why are you worrying about it?

If you want to keep some food with you as a back up, get stuff like Maggi, ready-to-it poha upma etc, canned food like peanut butter, jam, cheese and biscuits. Since you don't have a refrigerator, do net get anything that will perish if kept in the open like meat, eggs, vegetables, bread, milk, fruit juice. Try OMAD or Intermittent Fasting if you are into losing weight. Won't have to cook more than once. Win-win. Can anyone suggest medicines to keep handy during this time? 1. tea/coffee , sugar, milk powder
2. some bhujia packets to spice up your maggi
3. bread , peanut butter and honey
4. lots of nutella
5. tang or flavored glucose
thats all that came to my mind for now Popcorn alot of it,
Maggi lots Buy 3-4 kgs of peanuts and roast them and eat them with jaggery. Tasty  healthy and fill your stomach for long time. Milk powder, cereals If you have an induction cooker and appropriate utensils, it might be a good idea to stock up on some rice and dal. I can guarantee you will be sick of eating Maggi and stuff. Get ample amounts of sugar, salt, milk powder, cereals (maybe 2 kinds so you don’t get bored), and toothpaste if you’re halfway through. Oh and if you’re a girl, pads. You gotta buy them pads. 

Other than food, stock up on supplies that you’ll need to pass time. Like if you’re into art and have dwindling art supplies, buy those. Buy some notebooks, you can invest this time in learning stuff that your course will never teach you. In fact, learn stuff that you think you’ll never need in your life. 

I think that’s it though. /r/preppers 

/r/PandemicPreps get some rice Get a good fridge. Different flavors of noodle ready to eat meat and rice. Buy some medical tablets and bandages Lots of maggi and pasta. Don't forget coffee. Rice and potatoes. They can last for weeks and can be your plan b. you are not prepared at all. you're not going to be able to do 2 weeks like this. regroup and prepare well. Vermicelli  
Puffed Rice  
Flattened Rice Mill powder
Glucose biscuits

Maybe cheese or white butter Peanut butter,rice,beans,milk powder,instant upma. You can buy :

Dal
Pulses
Oil
Sugar
Tea
Salt 
Spices
Milk powder
Papad

Wouldn’t even in my inception level 6 I would believe that yogi has declared such schemes. ‘15 lakh’ 1000 thousand per day is 30000 per month. No one with an iota of common sense would believe it 

Still 1000 per month to every daily wager is an excellent initiative (If it is actually executed instead of being so e PR stuff that only exists on paper).

Rest of India needs to follow this as well. Our unorganised sector is absolutely getting decimated due to this crisis. All other state government are paying more plus providing shelter and free food.
Punjab Govt is spending 3-4 times of Yogi and also giving atleast 3k to all registered labourers and daily wage workers.

Perhaps this Sanghi pig is  jealous because many unemployed Muslim youths are getting employment because of food aggregrators. Hyderabad... Name itself looks Islamic. That guy should move to somewhere like Varanasi. There should be a rule that states that upon such discrimination, the delivery man is legally allowed to eat the ordered food. The payment money will have to be paid to the delivery guy who keeps 100% of it to himself. ""*The most tolerant religion*"" strikes again.

 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am in day 3 of lockdown, cut out 90% of sugar from my diet. It's getting easier by the day. Also much easier to diet when you can only eat at home. No gym for three more weeks so good time   to start bodyweight exercise routine. Drink whiskey.


Sit on the couch in your ac room.


Watch the plight of poor people as they scramble to survive.

Bang thaalis from the balcony. What is that point 11? You people are dating?! 22 . Fap , repeat WTF. All y'all don't have to work from home? point 17 definitely, talk with people much as u can, no one gonna say mai toh office mai busy hu re. You fuckers have holidays to do all these? I'm working my ass off from home here. I remember doing a list like this for my study holidays back in school. Achieved nothing until the last day.

I hope you don't end up just learning basic yoga on the 21st day. Good luck! OP. Great list, but slightly overwhelming. Instead of doing so much, I would just suggest people to do two things. 

1. Physical fitness - pick a routine, any routine. Reddit has plenty resources. But the point is to pick a routine that you can do at home and stick to it. Check out u/antranik's routine on r/bodyweightfitness. Good shit.

2. Mental fitness - meditate. If you're familiar with vipassana, now would be a good time to pick it up. If you don't know what that is, check it out. 

Both these things are hard. But we won't get a better time to be a little harsh on our lazy asses and get disciplined. And being disciplined doesn't mean being boring. Being disciplined means being in good control of your body and your emotions so you can do whatever the fuck you do 100%.

If you just take good care of your mental and physical fitness, the rest will come to you organically and from within, if it has to. I made my own lol

Fake review writing business has flourished ever since zomato became an integral part of people's lives Legally speaking, a blog is an opinion, not a reporting of facts.

Who is this ""national hospitality body""? Google didn't answer. 

Also, ""certified"" bloggers - who spend time getting qualified to do just one thing - writing reviews - will have no reason to leave a bad review. Surely! I bet Rajat Grover of 1BKH Superbar fame is ecstatic. Anybody can sue anyone. I can sue OP for this post. That's how law works. Let them go ahead - so once the courts shut them up there will be precedence and then this will die a natural death.

India's food safety practices summed up in one picture. hmmm. all that dust, grime and sweat. numnum. tasty!!! I dont get it, how would it hurt to atleast put it in a bag or cover it with a plastic. immunity I am confident we can say F U to any virus Country fully prepared for corona pandemic. Even corona virus will be infected by some disease in India. Where is this from in Noida? Spongecake Scooterstands r/noida me daal do. dead pda h woh sub.

Also they spray painted half of Noida about two years back for free advertising. 🤢🤮 😂😂even that 🐕 s showing his ass to the cakes .. The fuck.
Isse accha zeher kha lo. If we can digest this, then Corona shmorona Wtf! Itna kya low effort bc. Newspaper me he lapet deta. Hatt mkc

Bakery ke google review me photo add karde with 5 🌟 tag #DeshKiTatti I demand to have a cow in this picture! r/trashy We are all just gonna be super immune to anything by the next 10 years, superpower 2030. Although it's not a guarantee, it's usually a good idea to skip cheap eateries in India. I can't imagine a Big Chill doing this.

If you're going to eat cheap, stick to deep fried stuff. High temperatures tend to kill most bacteria look at the new reviews on zomato :P They hot bombed with  1 star I love how redditors are giving 1 star and leaving bad reviews for this bakery on Zomato. Good job guys, I’m proud of you. Can you imagine the conditions where these cake sponges are made??? Cockroaches, filthy surfaces, no hand hygiene , etc. Public health and food safety is such a joke in India. People should vote with their wallet and boycott such food establishments. On the brighter side, eating this disgusting food is giving a boost to your immunity (last part is a sarcastic comment) Flying cakes ? More like Flying fucks. They got none to give. Our parents are correct one more time :(

Better not eat outside Such Cake ,Much Hygiene Utterly butterly disgustious. When I refuse to have cake at parties becuase they are unhygenic, my friends think Im an elitist.
Ill now show them this. How can we be sure this for flying cakes Noida and not some other place. The number plate pretty much summed about the entire picture. Seeing the vehicle is  from UP state. The exposed parts are cut away and only the inner sponge is used to make cake layers with icing and fondant.    

All clear guys! Eat away!   /s Jugaad! ^(perfectly normal phenomenon) I am not even asking for some air tight packaging or hard crates. The least they can do it put paper around it. 

They didn't bother to do even that. This is probably going to leave oily stains on footrest and on the rider's trousers. If not for customers, could have done it for themselves, wtf You gotta develop that immune system somehow. No wonder Coronavirus hasn't hit this country, we basically eat shit everyday :D Modern solutions require modern problems. That’s why I seldom eat from such bakery and open places, it’s much safer to eat packaged cake and biscuit. With increased automation in industries, packaged food is much cleaner now. Ab yeh jo kutta side mein so raha hai, isne customer se pehle taste kiya hoga pakka. Good to see everyone fucking the bakery on Zomato comments. Unfortunately I don't have a Zomato account to join the party. Food outlets like this should be named and shamed. Well done guys.

ಠ_ಠ

Jokes aside, this is a grave situation.

Sadly, this reminds me of the people in power in Soviet Union, how they fucked the whole country while selling lies and corruption.

As someone recently asked,

>what's the cost of lies?

How long we are gonna lie to ourselves about the situation we are creating not only of ourselves but our future generations. Every sixty seconds in Africa, a minute passes As usual, no body is reading the article. 

> A whopping 41 per cent of the Delhi and NCR population are found to be suffering from severe heavy metal toxicity, according to a survey conducted by Daivam Wellness. **Out of 165 patients, 68 patients were found positive for some kind of severe metal toxicity**. The survey that was done over a period of 6 months, from May 2019 to October 2019 covering people from age group of 20 to 65 years, has now sparked off a scare.


The population of Delhi+NCR is 4.6 crores. The sample size of this survey is 165 which is **0.00035%** of the population. Should you be jailed for having a kid in Delhi? knowingly killing them? So 165 already ill patients were taken as a sample size, and based on these patients, 41% of Delhiites is extrapolated. 

The article is just sensationalized and poorly crafted clickbait journalism. In it the source of the survey isn't clearly mentioned but there is a comment from a doctor from Daivam wellness. Had to Google search to find that the survey was also conducted by them. 

So it seems Daivam Wellness Clinic got an infomercial out of it. After all, when it comes to health, hyping up the fear is what works best. The news also spreads faster. And it seems to have worked as well since the article is the most read on their site for the week.

I am in no way implying that the situation in Delhi isn't serious. Just that attention grabbing and sensationalized headlines with a dubious methodology of research will create more doubts than provide a concrete answer. The death of Delhi.

TLDR - im just sad im feeling ashamed to tell my family and friends im gonna have to shut one of the outlets needed a place to vent :(",Bluebaleno," a friend of mine who is running a kitchen only outlet also is suffering major loss these days. no orders if no coupons are running. he actually is now experimenting with starting new premium (sounding) brands with much higher pricing and than offering good discounts on the pricing. same kitchen. same food. [removed] Why is that happening? To those of you asking I run a 2 subway stores and another south indian outlet I had to shut one of the subs the other one is barely making profit but that's a good sign with how things are right now Sorry to hear that. Don't feel ashamed about anything. It's natural to feel despondent when you have to shut down your business.

  


All this up and down is part of life. Take your time. And bounce back harder. Good luck 👍 What do you mean by swiggy zomato problems? Is it that people are spending less on all this? Sad to hear this. Small business owners such as you form the backbone of our economy. Hope you come back from this stronger.

I'm no one to tell you what you tell your friends and family, but often I've found, there's simply no substitute for plain and simple truth. Businesses fail, no need to take it personally. They are close to you, they'd understand.

Best wishes for your future venture. [Check out this thread for similar discussion from another restaurant owner such as you](https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/d43na8/alternate_investment_avenues_any_success_stories/f0807p9/) Feeling sad for you. 

Also disappointed by the fact that food-outlet owners in India shows no innovation in creating menu . 

I am still not sure if this idea will bring any change in your work.

&#x200B;

Agree the impact of swiggy on businesses Nope don't do that. Zomato and swigy are just loaded kids. If you need inspiration read Sam Walton's Made in America. How this guy beat Kmart who was giant at his time with his basic principal.

Become customer oriented, don't add sell spoiled paneer and keep the hygiene  up people will come by. Didn't know the slow down has such direct affects, but I think Zomato and Swiggy have a lot to do with this. There are a few Udupi restaurants near my place and the only customers they get now are the loyal customers. The owner of one of the restaurant I frequent told me that he knows most of his customers by face / name and his home delivery service is almost never called because of Swiggy/Zomato.

Since he operates on thin margins, adapting Swiggy and Zomato would mean making losses which he doesn't want to do. A lot of people that stumble upon these place do definitely become repeat customers just because of the friendliness of the owner, the hygiene and taste. But a lot of people aren't coming out of houses because food delivery service is cheap and more convenient.

Another proper dine-in restaurant near my house started pushing own coupons. So, everytime you order from Swiggy, they put a leaflet in the packaging that requests the customer to order directly and get similar discounts. This way, he's eliminating the need to pay Swiggy. I think his discounts aren't absolute discounts but free stuff or coupons that you can redeem in the next order. Not sure how it's working out for him, though. Apart from my first comment which gives a idea on how to survive I am just venting out as a customer.

The reason people are going for zomato or swiggy is because they have people who listen to the customer in case of issue. In the case of local vendor if you bring back the packed food and say its spoiled. The shop owner show his big glare to the customer and make sure to remind that he is a outsider in a city and the shop owner is the local don.

People do not want cash back every time they complain. They complain because they think you guys could fix that from next time. As I see the restaurants or streets they would be locked down if the FDI officer do their job properly.

So, to all the ass\* ho are crying over the down economy and serving the same three days old ""samosa"" after re-frying to customer. Your competition is not with Swiggy or Zommator your competition is to the millions of the home maker (mothers and sister) who can make a nice and fresh meal in budget then you. This is kind of unrelated, but what are your profit margins? Instead of being quieter talk more about it. Right now country is not even realising we are in recession. Best of luck bro. Failure in entrepreneurship is nothing to be ashamed of. Learn lessons and move on. Out of the loop here; how is Zomato and Swiggy fucking things? 

Had heard bad stuff about Zomato gold from some restaurants but didn’t know kitchen only restaurants are also being hit. What food do you guys sell ? Sucks to hear. Hope your situation improves soon. 

Having said that, restaurants that are able to compete in these difficult times are probably amongst the best ones in terms of customer satisfaction. Maybe you can look into why some are managing to survive the circumstances better than you. Millenials are just eating at home now Curious, you are making Rs 3 lakhs a month, how much do the Zomato/Swiggy eat into your profit share? From 36000 a week to 10000 a day the business must be doing good right ? sorry to hear it bro. 

What kind of food did you sell? I hope shutting down this outlet will at least save you from losing more money! What are these ""Zomato Problems""? I have seen a lot of restaurants with this. What is the issue? Hey, staying in context is there a body that decides what restaurants should price their food at? Like have a cap to max pricing and if I price a dish at 300bucks does it justify me selling it at that price ?. I am a millennial,  i avoid restaurants, food outlets like a plague. I prefer homemade food over any restaurant or food outlets. I’d eat restaurant food in rare cases, like hanging out with friends with unhealthy food habits.

Why? 


1. Who the fuck know how you folks prepare the food. Do we even have hygienic conditions certified, well, im sure it can be bought with some bribing.

2. What kind of sub- standard ingredients you might have used to reduce the price or increase your margins.

3. And for those zomato and swiggy, where do u get the food from? From some ghost kitchens with no hygienic certifications or restaurants which send in left over food or delivery boys mishandling and tasting the food before delivering to me. 

I hope all my millennial fellows boycott these restaurants, outlets like KFC, McDonalds and prefer home made fresh and hygienic food over these discounted swiggy or overpriced pubs.

Wait and watch. I'm more worried about the ***celebrations*** that will follow once it ends. Yes, Our Politicians are narrow-minded to think they can contain the spread with a meagre 21 days lockdown.
To be honest the countrywide lockdown is an utter failure. It had the same effect India had when the BJP announced demonetization. The worst-hit are the poor and underprivileged. 
Besides Indians have the habit of making everything an event. The day when our incredibly naive PM announced a one-day curfew, the entire community ended up celebrating at the end of the day with banging and hugging. I think there will be lockdown at the state levels. After 21 days, hope general lockdown will not be imposed but only regions where the virus is prevalent ! Otherwise there may be open riots !

But for that extensive testing has to take place, for which India is neither prepared nor is capable ! we never know ... pray to corona devil I don't think we, India as a whole, can afford lockdown that long.

Really? And you didn't see poor people stocking things up? Everyone during panic buying, from rich to poor, were stocking things up. A family near me who earns 5000 rupees a month (yes, 5,000, not 50,000) stocked with whatever money they have.

>  I love the way how some people are cribbing about being stuck in their homes with nothing to do. When there are some stuck without homes and nowhere to go

And? Whats your point? People who live normal lives and don't suffer like poor people should spend their entire life just thinking about poorer people? No social life, no friends, no love life, no education, no food, no hobbies, nothing. Just wake up in the morning and start thinking about how poor people are worse off and therefore I should spend my day just being depressed about how I should feel guilty of being born in a well-to-do family?

> I love the way some elites are positing their fitness videos on the social media

Even rickshawalas near me sometimes do Suryanamaskars. Everyone has their lives. Again, we should not care about fitness?

> When there are 1000s of migrants walking 100s of miles and this is not for exercise

People love eating. I love eating. I guess the poorest people also want to one day eat good food.

> When there are people sitting in the middle of the roads eating whatever is handed out to them out of kindness

There has always been homeless people. And often they eat whatever is given to them. You saw such people for the first time? Also, how much of your food are you giving them?

Hey, we have been kept in extremely bad conditions (everyone was not for a 'few hours') and we are confused and don't know what is happening but lets be calm because there are people who are worse off than us. Guess we are evil for being annoyed.

> There are two different Indias that we live in. One for the rich and one for the poor

Then there are middle classes. Lower middle class (like me) and upper middle classes.

>  Sometimes, we are unable to see beyond our life, our world, our zones of comfort

If you think we, people who are not in poverty, are braindead people and we don't think about philosophy and you are the only one who is thinking about this - you are wrong my friend. Also, we have a physical body, we have our lives. We are all humans. Our lives matter to us. No one is gonna be there - rich or poor - if you fail your exams or job interview. So yeah, we are quite busy with ourselves. Many poor people are occupied with themselves too.

>  Forget about understanding, we can't even empathize with that India. The India of the poor.

So many social activists. Literally a mountain of research papers, articles, initiatives, shelters for poor people. But yet you think nobody cares about them. Wow. 

> We have been shielded away from it

Unless you live in Antilla, nobody is shielded from anything. We can literally see poor people, most of us being relatively poor ourselves, everyday. And yeah, sometimes we think about them too.

> recognize the other side of India, which is starving and fighting for their lives

We all do it son. We all do. Life isn't easy for anybody. Even the richest people have to struggle to maintain their business so that it doesn't crash. Everyone struggles in their lives. From poor to rich.

> even as we show discomfort of being locked down for a few days.

Even poor people are locked down. Lockdown isn't only for 'rich' people.

I don't know what is wrong with you. You seem to have gone crazy by being locked up in your home and now you are trying to push anyone who isn't suffering from extreme poverty to commit suicide by making them feel guilty of being alive and well-to-do. According to you, we should not do anything, no study, no love life, no eating, no drinking, nothing and just sit and think about how we are bad evil people suppressing poor people. Honestly, you don't seem to have too much knowledge about poor people either. My family has passed through poor to rich phases and no, we aren't as helpless as you think and rich people aren't as braindead as you think.

Sorry for this long rant against your deluded assumptions. God knows who the hell filled these up in your brain. Don't worry. Poor people, middle class people, rich people are all working their ass off to live a proper life. Nobody is sitting and mourning like you. 

I don't know what is this new trend of fetishizing poor people, but this has to stop. There is nothing noble in being poor. Eating roti with water isn't noble. Everybody wants to be rich, even the poorest of people. And everybody has their lives and their problems. Go, eat something, study and sleep. You are overthinking. LOL, what this even is! What is your point besides broadcasting you noble sense of equality?

Go, put it in your diary and save us the cringe. This reads like someone made public your private journal to humiliate you.

Do you really think this post and the other one you made (hypocrisy of middle class) are too intellectual, or too poetic? Do you think you are making us see the reality that all of us missed, and now that you have pointed it out, we are all in tears? Is that what you think?

You are so sure of your empathic powers, like you are the only in touch with the suffering of poor, and the rest are blinded by their privileges, eh? I can't even fathom this level of ego on people.

Please go and make fitness videos or put recipes on Twitter, whatever. I am just a stranger on internet, but trust me, there is nothing to feel guilty about doing those things. I am not into social media but I am taking a break from a group I am in because I have had enough of people whining and whinging about first world problems like being bored with Netflix or craving for some fancy-ass salad.

Actually I am just going to quit. Clearly it's not a good fit. I may not agree with the op on all points. Everyone has their own lives to live, some do it by eating good food and posting it on social media.
What I agree whole heartedly is the indifference some people have for migrant workers and poor in general. It's not because they are spiteful, not because they are selfish brats. Its because some people don't understand how it is to be poor, how their daily lives can change instantly, like it has now. 
The economic order has always been against the poor and the middle class. The system is broken and it needs fixing. How can one man have so much money? How is that fair? Yes, he has worked hard but would he be here if not for his workers who toil endlessly and get paid pennies. 
The government be it this one or the previous one have been woeful. They have pushed the economy down the drain. People are unemployed or work for slave wages. 
Ps : some people need to live their lives, be it posting on social media or complaining about food. There is no point blaming them. Blame the system and people who run it. Blame the super rich who never pay their workers enough. Blame the government for not thinking about poor while making sweeping decisions which affects them the most. इसीलिए मैं सबसे कहता हूँ, विशेष कर के ये जो gated socities में रहते हैं-- समय समय पे जनरल (चालू) डिब्बे में यात्रा किया करें (UP/Bihar - Delhi रूट पे )। आपका जीवन दर्शन हमेशा ज़मीन से जुड़ा रहेगा। They know exactly how ""poor"" india is.

Same happened with ola uber drivers who were earning like 1 lakh plus+ when incentives were high. Did the delivery boys really expect that the salary model was sustainable ? some were earning around 40-45k per month or even more than that. Its basic economics catch the market using freebies and incentives , later on shoot up prices. Same happened with ola, uber. Next are these food delivery services, after that jio will also show its true colours. 'gig' economy These food delivery companies will die soon in losses won't they Deepinder Goyal must be losing it. Robots can scan unlimited menus, but menus and hotels are limited. first of all Zomato workers should understand that there is s economic slowdown. moreover the food prices  shown in Zomato are more than the actual price at hotel.  people are ready to pay more but consumers slowly realising that the food is not as per their expectations such as quantity and quality. Even I am avoiding Zomato. People are saying India is the perfect opportunity for startups but it seems like the economy is bad enough for the so called ""startup culture"" to survive. ""Fine I'll do it myself"" is my reaction after finding out the field is mine to play. Here in Berlin, till this years start we had 3 food delivery companies. 

Foodora, deliveroo, and liferando. 

2 of them have shut shop and only 1 remains in the market right now, even their delivery times are upwards of 1 hour. 

I don’t think its a very profitable business. This is where the sustainability of this model comes into picture. You'll get offers until they have investor money to burn. What do they do after that?

I believe that Zomatos, Swiggys and foodpandas (don't know about the rest) revenue models are unsustainable. Enjoy the deals while it lasts/while investors pump in $$$.

My thinking is this - a restaurant hiring someone - the employee cost will be a part of their overheads, which is subsumed by overall revenue earned by the restaurant.

Whereas, Z's or Sw's revenue is say 25% of a particular delivery only order, therefore the employee cost being absorbed by a limited revenue stream will be significantly lesser, unless the delivery guys make at least four trips a day. It may take them many many more years to break even.

Also, when I order from them, I get huuuge discounts which are not necessarily cash backs. Offsetting that maybe more costly than the benefit itself.

They are looking at expanding and creating a greater market base (like all app based companies do and should) but its close to saturation. I'm sure these guys are looking at alternate revenue streams. I am not entirely sure how these delivery boys feel entitled to ask for incentives and bonuses.

I work in IT, I get bonus ONLY if my company did well the past year, if I kissed my boss' ass enough, sacrificed a virgin to the mighty gods AND made it rain 4 days in a row. If not, I get nothing.

Edit - 
Under the POCSO Act, the age of consent is 18 for both boys and girls. Too bad. 

Some states in the US have Romeo and Juliet laws that penalize sexual activity only where the age gap between consenting minors is more than 3 or 4 years.

India should take heed and probably lower it to 16 years from 18 at least. This week is going to be a happening one. Ye u/SapianSaw kidhar hai.

They loathe Nestle and can possibly make this news viral. Why is Nestle suddenly violating laws in India? Is it looking to join BJP? Ok I guess some proper information needs to be given here. I am a medical Prof who has done fair share of research across international papers and so I can tell abt these studies and what is the ACTUAL problem.

1. First of all, clinical trials on premature babies are done all the time. Observational studies, randomized control trials are done occasionally and hence it is not 'BARBARIC'. These trials are done precisely to know whether the treatment options that we have are even worth it or not. 

The substitute for breast milk is actually necessary especially when mother is not lactating and you need to feed breast milk to baby. The suckling reflex hasn't developed in premature baby and hence they need to be given from outside. Sometimes breast milk is just not available or is inadequate and hence a substitute is absolutely necessary.

2. Ok now comes this study. First of all, any study of such type is always done after ethical clearance AND after consent from the parents. This is true for all subjects of any study. Most probably there is a case control study here where some premat babies are fed normal breast milk and some are fed with substitute milk. And then the growth is seen. After the result the subjects are always shifted back to standard therapy .

Again consent is always taken.

3. Now we say any Nestle. The thing which Nestle did was break the law which said THEY CANT GIVE MONETARY OR OTHER BENEFIT TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. Nestle is a company which is creating a new product. That is fine. They have to get it tested in clinical trials. That is completely fine as well. The researchers have to do it in respective hospitals with proper place for premat babies and a NICU etc etc. That is fine as well.

However giving benefits to the researcher involved for a skewed result? That is not ok. 

Starting research before official ethical clearence certificate? That is not ok.

Basically if the wordings of this article are correct, then the problem is that Nestle is most prob hiring researchers on their own terms and hence the study isn't exactly unbiased...

4. Is it harmful to babies? It depends really. If they are shifted back to current gold standard of treatment after results and everything else is ensured ( see their exclusion criteria is pretty good). Then it won't hurt them. However is the results are skewed when they are actually not useful then it can be harmful for further babies who receive them in subsequent trials. Hence why unbiased research is really important in clinical trials.

So everyone, hold your horses. It is not as unethical as you are thinking. They are not killing babies here nor are they doing something absolutely horrible. However it does become unethical when it is forming an unbiased research. That should be condemmned. 

Research is a wonderful thing and we should do it unbiased to help everyone involved. Nowhere is any mention of penalizing the company. Is there any provision of penalty or prosecution for the company involved. Man. Nestle is fucked up
And I thought I was being healthy by eating nestle products India is/becoming the guinea pig for experiments of the western world! Do the parents know that their infant is part of such trials? Does the doctor or anyone else inform them? Ugh There real question should be , what are we going to do about it? Congress mouthpiece is doing better journalism than many so-called neutral outlets like Republic.  I'm not even suprised tho! Nestle has a reputation of going to third world countries and doing shit like this. They are honestly, EVIL! How much evil shit can be leveraged over Maggi noodles Evil scum, its hard but I try my best to stay away from their products Don't they already have premature baby food? Pure evil!

Food,With all the police brutality at show during the times of this pandemic I wonder if these police men should really be in police. There should not be any harrasment from the police when the public needs their support.,224,fpoww3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpoww3/with_all_the_police_brutality_at_show_during_the/,35,"I don't know if there is a system in place to screen people who apply for the job, if it's there it needs to improve if not then put in place. This just shows the mental health of these people. They are no more than gundas in the uniform and we do not need those people. 

I want these people be kicked out of the force because of them people are worried /scared more then they need to be.

Although abuse, this following is quite funny ;)

https://twitter.com/i/status/1243377898079338496 A saying goes that Getting a job in the police is a dream come true for killers.

Not saying it applies to everyone but the rampant abuse of power and corruption makes it true for a majority. At the risk of getting downvoted, I would like to say that you can't kick them out of the force.

Understand that in India most policemen are people who couldn't get a job anywhere else. Have you ever heard someone say ""I want to be a policeman when I grow up""?

Police in India work under a lot of red tape. They don't do police work, they do the work that the government requires them to do. _Rapist is a minister, don't act on it. This rape is getting lot of media attention, kill the rapists_ that kind of work. There's very little genuine policing happening in normal times.

When I moved to Chennai, I was pleasantly surprised to see lots of police vehicles moving around at night. That's genuine policing, they aren't waiting for a call, they are out there on the streets to ensure nobody needs to call in the first place. I don't see any such policing in Kolkata or Mumbai. In these cities, you'll see the police only where they are absolutely needed.

Add to all this that we have a shortage of police officers. We simply don't have enough policemen for our population. Prisons are overflowing, cases go on for ages, police processes are outdated and in serious need of reforms and modernisation.

If sitting at your desk for over 9 hours makes you stressed, imagine what 10 hours of running around in the streets will do when the guidelines for your actions come not from the book of law, but from the messages of your local political leader.

I'm not even surprised that our policemen are perpetually frustrated and ready to wield the baton at the drop of a hat. Kicking them out will not solve the problem because it's not the individual's fault, it's the fault of the system they work under.

I worked at a government organisation once, tried to do more than I was asked to. I soon got a transfer order. Thankfully it was early in my career. I left and got into the private sector. Not everyone has that luxury. So I can tell you that a lot of people in that organisation wanted to work. But when your boss sends you a printout of 3 pages to find the total of all the rows instead of forwarding the document on email, there's only so much you can do to get the total quickly. M gonna say it. The current situation has given the ""few bad apples"" an unrestrained access to assault and harassment of innocent people. They are educated illiterates, they don't know the difference between law enforcement and law itself. India needs literate policemen. You know shit's bad when general public get PTSD from police. Are our police even trained to handle something of this magnitude? I'm genuinely wondering if they've ever been trained on disaster management, showing empathy, using common sense when under pressure? 

Perhaps they aren't trained for any of this and all the news of police brutality is a direct result of this. The rank and file *needs* to be better trained.


I just read this piece of news and it is very unsettling:
The Indian Express: India lockdown: Three Bihar cops held for shooting at van driver, seeking bribe.
https://indianexpress.com/article/coronavirus/three-bihar-cops-held-for-shooting-at-van-driver-seeking-bribe-6333679/ Entire city at your disposal and can beat anyone you want . It must be a dream come true One more here. Policemen beating up municipality officials too!

https://youtu.be/hbUTzQGCVR8 They should be in mental hospital or some spiritual camp where they can get calm or learn some humanity.

OK, not all policemen are brutal but I am saying about those who have no empathy and just start beating. They should be provided counseling. Foreign people on social networks are so happy with this ""Strictness"" and want their own countries to implement such hooliganism. Both Insta and TikTok comments are full of ""omg, so efficient. Our cops are wuss. We need it here"" etc. Usually Police are the slaves of ruling party in every state. But this Central Home Minister gives extraordinary protection for Police, hence, they are bold enough to let rioters shoot with illegal unlicensed gun in front of them, also helping rioters to find stones to throw. So now they are bold enough to rough up anyone seen on the road, instead of warning them. 

In TN, while a group of Revenue Officials were inspecting a grocery shop on the
Complaints of price jagging, suddenly few policemen lathi charged them without knowing they are Gov officials. Tahsildar was noting down the policemen’s name and inspector is begging to him in the CCTV footage distributed in Twitter. 

Unless a proper guideline is given to policemen in this kind of situation, they will continue to misuse their power. So I wondering...what can be done?

Part of me thinks that every recorded incident can be forwarded to the  respective High Court, asking the Court to take cognizance of the matter and to remedy it through removal of the individual from the police force. Police brutality huh?

Food,Banks are going to become a hotbed for Corona Virus Infection. Situation will be more fatal than that of any religious gatherings.,115,fuhls2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuhls2/banks_are_going_to_become_a_hotbed_for_corona/,26,"This is going to be long but it's necessary to put all facts clearly. 


****TL;DR: Gov announces stupid DBT, Bankers are scared for dear life, people are starting flocking banks in thousands, possibility of infection rises exponentially. Many Bankers and People are gonna get sick or die.****


Just want to direct some attention toward a section of essential service which is seldom talked about in good terms yet it stands at the forefront in this pandemic.


Banks are open. Yes, for a few days the timings were reduced to 4 hours but timings are back to  normal now. All staff have been told to present in full strength and told to work amid the fear of contracting the virus.


Most of you reading this may not have visited a Bank Branch located in semi urban or rural areas (RuSU) . The Banking environment is vastly different in rural or semi urban branches as compared to Metro or big cities branches. Semi urban branches are located at Taluka/tehsil level and rural branches are located at Rural places. Most people in urban areas use digital means to carry out their banking needs but that's not the case in RuSU areas. 



These RuSU branches have huge footfall owing to the least digitally literate demographic residing in these areas. Bigger the PSB greater the footfall. Amidst this lockdown Bank people are told to work and keep essential services running such as cash transactions, ATM replenishment among others which is ok to an extent.



Now here's the catch, on one hand our PM asks people to stay at home to contain the spreading but on other hand FM launches a scheme called PM Gareen kalyan scheme which announces some direct cash benefit to jan- dhan women account holder as well as pensioners. All this money is going to come in these accounts. 




Keep in mind that you can't expect people to act rationally especially in RuSU areas. Now what is happening is that huge swathes of people have started visiting branches without checking their eligibility as they must have watched someone shouting in a random news channel about gov distributing money. For Bankers, it brings back the haunted memory of Demonetization crowd.



Bank management has told the Branch personnel to equip themselves with sanitizer, masks as well as make sure people maintain proper distance. First thing, premises of most of these RuSU branches is pathetic. Most of these are in dilapidated state and only a bunch of people can stand comfortably at a time in branch. So it's not possible to handle the huge crowd that is swarming these branches. Combining with the fact that people are getting restless and anyone with a passbook is rushing, pushing and shoving to get inside and near the counter only to be told that he is not eligible or the funds have not arrived yet.



A few Bankers in a branch are expected to handle thousands in a day which is very tiring and depressing if you think about it. But the main thing is it is impossible to maintain social distance among the crowd. I mean how will you manage to maintain the social distancing among the crowd of 1000.



So now a single person with virus will unknowingly spread it to hundreds among those thousands and then these hundreds will then infect their families. Needless to say that many bankers will contract the virus as they will be dealing with the cash, the pass book among others.



One more thing, it's not a one time exercise, our great great FM has made sure that people come three times in three months to withdraw Rs 500 each time so that the lucky ones who got spared the first time get infected the other couple of times.



This is, in my personal opinion, such a bad decision that I literally have no words to explain the absurdity of it. What's the purpose of lockdown when you are allowing Crores of people to get out of their homes and gather at one place? Is it different than any religious gathering that's been a hot topic from couple of days now? 




I am so aghast that no one is talking about it. You may ask then what would these poor people eat if they don't have money. For this my answer would be people don't eat money. Have the gram panchayat through PDS distribute the food free of cost. Have people's medical need met free of cost through ASHA workers etc who resides in the villages. I mean there are many alternatives to cash. When people will have food to eat and health to be taken care of then they won't need to go outside and they will then be saving themselves and their community from the infection. 




No need to emphasize that after Doctors, Bankers right now are the second most vulnerable section to get infected. But nobody hardly acknowledges that. This is sad. 



I am sure that this senseless decision of government will come back to bite them back and many people will lose their lives.",dummy_roxx," We are indeed royally fucked. My mother works as a cashier at a PSB. And every single day I'm scared shitless of the moment I'll have to face when one of these days my father would call me with some bad news.

The worst thing is, people will not only come to collect cash, but some will come even to deposit cash. And this cash, we will never has been passed around through so many hands, ultimately ending the hands of my mother. This makes her quite a big target.

Yes, the bank has provided her with sanitizer and surgical masks, but surgical masks can only protect you so much. One part of me is really anxious all the time. I just hope this time passes quickly and nothing bad happens to her. Even after 14th April also, if they open banks completely or some hours, then they can become a centre of spread. Hello , my mother works in a bank in a semi urban setting.I drop her off and pick her up every 2-3 days a week. The points which you made were all the things which she tells me every day after work.

 She has had to talk to many such individuals with jan dhan accounts and satisfy their queries. Way back during demonitzation i remember she used to come home late, she had to work ungodly hours and with panic stricken people, listen to their abuses dayy after day. 

Now the condition in her bank (which is nationalised btw) is that they have limited sanitizers and their manager is not going and bringing in masks for the employees which was mandated by their head branch/office. So now my mother has been using 4 days old n95 mask by spraying hand sanitizer and washing it daily. I am super scared for her health because she is the rock of our house , my retiree father is above 60 and is A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BHAKT , he doesn't see how this PM's decision-making has caused a lot of difficulties in his own wife's life.

 I have a friend who owns a pharmacy business i am trying to get masks from him, but it has been difficult as there is a lot of demand for masks in the field rn.
I don't know how we are going to escape from this i just hope we do, meanwhile my dad bangs plates at 5pm, curses muslims every day and night and no doubt will shut our power down tomorrow. Don't worry current govt doesn't test clusters in bank, religious places of all religions except one, mass exodus of migrants, markets etc. Everyone other than Modi is expected to make sacrifices. Chutiya planners. I hope by some miracle we have some sort of slight immunity to this virus. With the way things are going, we're all fucked. I'm sorry for the situation for all our people working in the banking sectors and I hope your they stays safe. I would like to know if anyone has any thoughts about physical currency being completely removed from our economy and digital currency taking as the only form of payment? What would be the impact of such an implementation in the near future if not now. I don't know why the govt doesn't make coming to bank of employees greater than a certain age (let's say over 50) optional? At least it would be one step towards mitigating this issue. What would you suggest? The poor need to be supported. My dad is a bank officer and I am legit scared as fuck. Moreover he is nearing 60 and due to the lockdown the whole family is at different places he is alone there. 
 
And the sad thing is people are visiting bank for the most trivial issues that really need not be attended during a pandemic. People dont listen. Please if its not an emergency dont visit a bank.  Withdraw from an ATM, do an online payment, and if you have to clear some issues call the bank person and clear it over the phone if its possible and ofcourse wait till its over if it can wait. I think the SBI Branch managers who deny internet banking for older accounts since it involves work for them to generate an internet banking ID deserve it..  My parents have quite old bank accounts where SBI refuses to close the account and they also refuse to provide net banking since they maintain a low balance (about 15k which is low for rich urban branches)

&#x200B;

The banks try to keep people reliant on visiting them, it gives the branch managers a sense of power to have people visit them and ask for money instead of bypassing them. It also gives them an opportunity to mis sell products. 

&#x200B;

Its not like the undeucated poor cannot use ATM's or debit cards. Plenty of maids\\cooks and drivers\\guards use them, my maid even accepts salary via GPay and uses the ATM to withdraw, its the Bankers who forced this situation on themselves out of sheer arrogance Wait. So you mean the poor who needed the money should have been left to their own devices? 

The sad reality is that you cannot completely stop life. You need to go out to buy food and essentials. You need to go to the bank to withdraw money for said essentials. There's no way around it.

Lets all say Wah MudiJi Wah! Modi hai to mumkin hai.. FCI hasn't been getting their money from the government for more than a decade now, [it was the same even before Modi and with the Congress government](https://images.assettype.com/bloombergquint%2F2019-01%2F615dbb12-e935-437a-af9d-c4a9f48f197b%2FOFF_BUDGET_FINANCING_OF_FOOD_SUBSIDY_01.png?w=960&auto=format%2Ccompress). FCI borrowed loans from banks and the government paid those loans! So what has changed? 

* National Food Security Act, 2013 which increased the coverage
* ""Buy High, Sell Low"" philosophy of FCI which leads to Higher supply of wheat and rice stocks than demand
* Due to high supply, the stock is either wasted or private players rent it out for which FCI plays rental costs

So what does the FCI do when government no longer pays and banks can no longer disburse loans? The government lends it money via   - National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) [67% of their funds](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/food-corporations-reliance-on-national-small-savings-fund-rose-further-in-fy19) come from them. 


[CAG audit had warned about this in 2017](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/stK4MriiNoMkJSGgJYfSDP/CAG-flags-loopholes-in-food-subsidy-scheme.html) but the current government has taken no steps to address the situation. How does the govt. mess up in basic economic policies which even a 12th grade commerce student would know how to implement. I have a doubt. From where does the govt procure wheat and rice for the ""Food Security Bill"" which in a way affects the PDS system ? Is it in anyway related to the Food corporation of india? Debt doesnt die, it just changes hand, someone will be holding all this shit when the music stops, and when it does, be it LIC or NSSF it will be in a a shitstorm. God help us all.

Food,Food unites. Location: Berlin,366,d17kn0,https://i.redd.it/k462jctgfbl31.jpg,55,,Bon_Koios," I think it's mostly Pakistani food, they just add India to it to sell more as Indian food is more people know about Indian food. In the US too, most Pakistani restaurants say 'Pakistani Indian' in order to sell more. Not many people know about Pakistani food I guess. Its a Pakistani restaurant. No Indian restaurant owner advertises as Pakistani-Indian food, only the Pakistani ones do. Not that I have a problem with that, just stating some facts Thats the description of almost every Pakistani restaurant in the west. The thing is Indian and Pakistani food is mostly similar but Indian food is more known and to attract more people they mention Indian in the description. Even Bangladeshi restaurants call it a Indian-Bangladeshi restaurant. Thats how you can identify if it is an Indian or a Pakistani owned restaurant, not that I care but there is a slight difference in the tastes Owner of a restaurant in Singapore serving Indian food told he was from Punjab. Well he was not incorrect...just a matter of which Punjab! Almost every ""Indian"" restaurant in New York is actually owned by Bangladeshis. Indian and Pakistani food are craved for the same bartan. The food is very similar as per the North Indian food and the food from Pakistan. Animosity has made this division that India and Pakistan are of two very different countries they are not. We wear similar clothes and we have a common language. YOU'RE AT LOLLAPALOOZA? GO TO PERRY STAGE TONIGHT most 'Indian' restaurants are usually run by pakistanis/bangladeshis in europe this might be because of that. How would they like random street food festivals with interchangeable German-Austrian food? awesome, we just had a similar event here in Oslo. Love Indian food Holi Cow :O Inb4 German gaurakshaks threaten the event.

On another note, the reason they include ""Indian"" in their name because food is quite similar in both countries and most people have heard of Indian food. In addition to it, since India is a huge cultural exporter (Bollywood, yoga etc), it makes sense to be grouped in the predominant culture due to each others' similarities. But trust me, most Indians or Pakistanis don't care about the nationality of restaurant owners. People get along quite well. One famous restaurant that comes to my mind is Zareen's in Palo Alto/Mountain View. Actually, having been to Berlijn, the chances are that the person preparing and selling the food isn't actually from any of the 3 prominent South Asian nations of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.

For example, a lot of kitchens in Croatia serve Turkish food (but there aren't any Turks in-house) and many of the pizza outlets in Germany have Romanians (rather than Neapolitans) working in the kitchen. [deleted] Reminds me of indian- pakistani same-sex female couple. It should be Indian Pakistani food right? I mean first India and then Pakistan was carved out of it in 47.

Gaya kutta. The guy said he sent it to his village and he's absconding. WTF There is no repentance for this.Good boi thief😡 Holy fuck! That woman is so unbearable so full of herself!!!

Even though Zomato responded to her via DM immediately, she tweeted calling for uninstalling Zomato until they return her 'Dottu' back to her and retweeted someone else who said that he has requested all his family members to not order from Zomato. She even tagged PMOIndia for this!

Apart from that in her Twitter feed she is seen posing with her book with all the celebrities whom she for a picture to be taken with - Rafael Nadal, Jeffery Archer, Arun Jaitley. And her twitter handle name is Vandy**4PM**! Narcissist no. 1 she is!!!

FYI, the delivery guy did not take the dog when he was delivering food. Apparently the dog was loitering *outside* their house near an eatery where Zomato delivery guys come for order pickups. That is where and when the dog was picked up. It could have been literally picked up by anyone else too. >roaming inside the premises of her home cum-factory complex

Food,Hi everybody. I am 18 M and boarding a flight for the first time. Can someone please guide me about the entire process of boarding a flight?,36,fk93tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fk93tr/hi_everybody_i_am_18_m_and_boarding_a_flight_for/,45,I'd be there  an hour before check in but am clueless about the entire process and kinda apprehensive of the unknown,treacherous_kid," You chose a good time So, basically this flowchart:

1. You reach the airport atleast an hour and a half before boarding time because right now airports are in a rush, so security checks are crowded.

2. Carry your ticket (e-ticket is also accepted) and your ID proof - without these you can't enter the airport.

3. If you have any registered baggage, get it X-Ray scanned and tagged. Your handbagage will remain with you.

4. Proceed to the airline counter. Handover your registered baggage, they will ask your ID again and give you your printed boarding pass.

5. Then proceed to the security check. Remove any metallic or electronic device you may have and keep it in the trays provided, remove your shoes too. Then, go wait in a line, then get checked by the metal detector when your turn comes.

6. Go to the gate in which your flight will depart and wait there for the boarding call.

7. Once the boarding call is made, queue up. There may be a secondary check, comply with that. And then take your seat in the plane.

8. Fasten your seatbelt and safe journey! There are couple of you tube videos . A word of request -- Please don't rush to exit like an idiot when flight lands at destination. Do not stretch your hand outside window. 1. Reach the Departure gates of the airport. Keep your booking confirmation in your mobile because the army/police guy will check your ticket/booking confirmation along with an ID with your face on it to match. Then you'll enter the premises after that initial check.

2. If you have only one bag (backpack), then take a printout of your boarding pass (equivalent of a ticket of a train) from the machines there giving your Booking ID (equivalent to PNR of a train ticket) and select your seat from the menu. If you don't want to do that, just go to the Check-in counter of your airline and they'll do it. If you have a luggage bag(called check-in luggage) along with your backpack, then directly go to the Check-in counter.

3. Some airports(not all) require a pre X-ray scan done before submitting your check-in luggage, some don't. The people of your airline near the counter will tell you. If it's needed, get that done and that sticker on it. Then at the Check-in counter, they'll weigh your luggage and you'll have to pay if it exceeds the limit. Then they'll put a sticker on your check-in luggage and it'll go off on a ramp. You'll get your Boarding pass with your Gate number and Boarding time. Your backpack will stay with you. Remember to not keep any batteries stuff or chargers in the luggage. Keep it in your backpack.

4. So you just completed Check-in and next is the security check. Keep all your Electronics and metal stuff (wallets/keys/charger/trimmer/lappy/earphones/belt/etc) on the tray and the security guy will check you. The line is long, will take 10-15 minutes. Keep your boarding pass in your hand because the security guy will stamp the security clearance on your pass, so don't leave that in the tray.

5. After this is done, keep your stuff back in your bag, see the Gate number on your Boarding pass and head to the gate where people are waiting. Double check on the displays whether you're on the right gate. Then once boarding begins (typically half hour before the flight time), they'll once more check your boarding pass and you'll either be sent to the flight via a bus or the gate will have the plane attached to the ramp. They'll finally check your pass once more and you'll head to your seat.

6. Enjoy your flight. After it lands, the pilot will tell you which carousel you can pick your luggage from. Listen to it and head to that. Pick your bag and off you go. Don't put your hand outside the window. Recently I came from kerela to my home town

People were staring at me Windows seat!! Domestic or international? Yahi time mila tha? Be ready to be checked top to bottom. Not the best time to fly tho. Anyways, if you dont have too much  luggage web check in. Book your seat. Download the airlines app and do all the customization there. Preorder food if you want to, tho I don't recommend. There's an option for lounges which you can use as an add on. You get to stay at a cozy and comfy place while you wait for your flight. They've got a decent buffet spread too. If you wish to do that, pre book em, coz it's cheaper. You'll have good leg room for the first five rows and the middle ones. If there is turbulence don't worry too much about it. Those jerks are common. Hopefully you reach your destination safely.

This is just an extension to the flowchart a brother commented.

If there's anything else, do let me know. Not about boarding a flight but about the seat. You can recline your seat, don't have to sit so stiff. There will be a round silver button that you can press to go back.

Nobody told me this when I first took a flight and sat 2 hours in attention, was too embarrassed to ask. 

So yeah, the seats recline, thank god for that button. It's always good to stand in the queue an hour before check in time. After that you have to complete the security check. The security personnel will tell you what to do. Always keep your phone's laptops and power bank in your backpack with you in the flight. You can take your own food if you don't want to buy food inside the flight. check these threads as well if you havent already -

You're misquoting the statement. He said that ""vegetables go through multiple hands before reaching you and thus have higher chances of carrying the virus."" There's a reason most places are constantly being sanitized.

This is also done to impose heavy restrictions so that people don't venture out of their homes in the name of getting vegetables. I can relate. Same situation in Goa. It is yesterday some deliveries started but still shops are shut. Essential scarcity. And they were the ones who were banging plates on the streets Inodori log alag hi level ke chutiye hote hai

Everything is almost at standstill here. Here, the government was extremely late in implementing measures and the country's population will pay the price for their foolishness. However, they are sort of saved by their low population densities and better public awareness.

 India on the other hand had implemented measures at the borders quite early in the timeline. However, we Indians are at much higher risks as compared to other countries thanks to our high population density and poor medical infrastructure. 

My parents and siblings live in Bangalore and I don't think they get the gravity of the situation. My sister still has to go to her job. My brother-in-law still takes the company cab to his office. They are corporates and it's highly likely that their jobs can be done from home. But their companies have not yet declared anything on those lines.

My dad who's 67, still goes to vegetables market everyday to pick fresh produce and is refusing my advise of buying food in bulk and stocking up the kitchen for two-three weeks of isolation. I am asking my parents to minimize their trips to markets and other people's homes to once or twice a week. 

My brother-in-law and sister are also not heeding my advice of stocking up food for two-three weeks. They are still going to restaurants to have dinners.

My relatives are getting their house renovated and are arguing that this virus is nothing and I am panicking without reason. Their argument: work needs to go on and if everything stops, how will poor people like the labourers fend for themselves?

 I am just trying to ask them to postpone all non essential activities for the next two weeks. But, it seems I am talking to an unaware audience.

I have a Canadian friend here, whose grandfather was in service during WWII. Even the veteran is saying that he has never witnessed a global phenomenon of this magnitude. While majority of Indians are being nonchalant about it.

Stay safe people! Flatten the curve!",sorrysuperman," History repeats because people don't learn from the past. I am in Bangalore myself, and was hoping to come to Canada in September for my post graduation. I am currently shitting my pants right now because people in India are totally oblivious to the concept of social distancing and they see it as rude. Unfortunately apart from talking to my own family members and advising them not to go out there is nothing much I can do. We are already in phase 3 but the government is just buying more time. Unfortunately we are all royally fucked. God help us. Indian govt has buried its head in the sand. What most people see are just some news articles stating the latest steps laid out by the government. I couldn't find a single article confirming or refuting these claims. Last week's advisory said that all travellers will be under quarantine from 13 th. People who landed on or after 13th reported back that they just had to fill a health declaration form, get their temperature checked and told to self isolate if symptoms appear. Yesterday, some travelers reported that they were taken to a hospital from the airport directly but again it looks like this is being done only by some states. A friend's friend who landed in a TN airport just a few hours back was allowed to go home. No tests, just the form and thermal scan with the advice to self isolate. I live in Germany, many people in the local FB group had asked those who traveled in the last few weeks to share their experience and this was the info we got. I read an article that said that ONLY THREE of the 236 Indians from Iran were tested as they are showing symptoms. So despite knowing that symptoms can take days, people are being allowed to go without testing. 

 If extensive testing is done, they're bound to discover community transmission. Ask your relatives to take this seriously. Bruh people have long life line in their hand , the plot armor is too strong for virus to penetrate. Only thing that will work is a curfew. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Grandpa be exaggerating.. Come on dude WWII trumps Corona or any other Pandemic/epidemic We have gomutra! I am worried about the same. I live in Singapore. My parents and, sibling and her family are in India. I have asked them to be very cautious and not to underestimate the situation. Told them how bad the condition is in Italy and India is following the same trend as that of Italy's initial days. But my biggest concern is even if my family people are very cautious they might still get infected if the people surrounding them are slacking off. Given the population density of India, I feel like the govt should enforce strict precautionary methods before its too late. I guess it boils down to our Indian mentality

Remember in school when you had cough/cold and your parents told it was fine to attend school and risk spreading it to others than stay at home and stop it's spread to others.

I've recently started interning at a start-up and my boss said this when I asked him if the employees  WFH-"" I'll be the last person to shut the office. Sab Chala jayega"". 

Mind you I take a bus to my office that takes around 1 hour journey time. Though the number of cases in Bangalore is low as of now but it boom instantaneously. 

The situation surely is scary Don't worry we have plenty of cow shit and cow piss for everyone. I'm trying to convince a family member to come back to Canada from Punjab and it's falling on deaf ears. 

According to them, it's safer there because India has fewer cases. I've made the points that India is not reporting cases because of lack of testing and government propaganda. The medical infrastructure is 100x in Canada, but they won't listen. Not to mention commercial means of flying home may not be available in the future.

I'm at a loss as to what to do. Any advice? We can beat Corona. People in the west even have pollen allergy lol but have you heard anyone having allergies here in India? 

Couple of months and we'll be fine. Your sis and bro in law cannot stop living their lives. Today was my second day in wfh and god, I'm bored af. Went for an evening walk, saw some people jogging and parents watching their kids play. Felt somewhat nice.

I feel Canada with less population and such self quarantine would look like a zombie apocalyptic place right now.",2020-03-17 23:29:40

I have worked in the marketing side of the food biz (think of a global fast food giant in India), so have some understanding of the processes and how the ecosystem works for the prominent food delivery partners such as Tomato and Twiggy. Moober as well. 

I have for the most part worked in digital marketing/advertising (mostly consumer facing brands) and if you have questions related to marketing or digital marketing, like why do the ads follow me, or why some Indian brands behave or react in a certain way. 

Also I will try to address questions to the best of my ability, won't be comfortable to discuss the exact brand names or my identity, apart from plausible hints! :)",truth_about_brands," What kind of sketchy personal data from Users phone do these apps capture in order to do targeted marketing?

How did you feel when you working in forces of crony capitalism? Did you have any guilt, that what you were doing is incorrect?

What happens now, post incidences like Tomato's video going viral. How do the crony capitalists' try to damage control? Does the baniya in Goyal Sahaab, ever rise up? Ye bhaiya kidhar gaye? Hello. A few questions from me.

1.	What is the behind the scenes of the food delivery companies. Also how much profit do they earn compared to the restaurants?
2.	How bad is targeted ads in India currently and how easy is it to obtain our data in the market?
3.	Also is our data shared around with other corporates too, once it has been used by the older corporate?
4.	Have you seen Mad Men? If yes, what’s your opinion on that show? 
From your experience so far,

What can I do different in starting a  kitchen? How much snooping do the apps do , since whenever i discuss about food , the notification pops up for lunch Dinner almost immediately?? 1. Why does restaurants on such food delivery apps charge high packing and other charges does it have to do something with the commission of such food delivery app ?

2. Food delivery apps collects 25rs etc as delivery fee but they never give me any bill with GST breakup for that service. (I do get restaurant's food bill) I am specifically asking about food delivery service tax invoice from Swiggy showing their GSTN and tax breakup on 25rs.

3. What's the opportunity and pay for a photographer for such 'Food photography' assignments in food delivery company ? What is done of left over excess food at night? Why do people in India obsess about the term 'Verticals'. I worked in US/Canada and never heard this from anyone, including regular Joe employees and the middle/upper Management.",2019-11-07 22:01:14

We have sheltered 3 labourers in a spare room.

We have two more rooms empty (The tenants left few months back). Can shelter healthcare workers in them if their landlord banishes them. Stay home and pay taxes. My mom donated one day's salary to pmnrf. I'm not sure how effective they are at doing what they do. I'd rather have that amount donated to some private NGO. I just don't trust anything that's government. I was kinda  mandatory cuz the principal sent a message on the whatsapp group. 
Good. Because most of them wouldn't have done it otherwise. I will start. I have been doing following things. 

1) I am teaching two kids who live next to my building so that they don't miss out on education. 

2) I doubled my regular monthly donation to AkshayPatra. They provide meals to kids in schools. I have seen their cooking and their accounts first hand. They ensure food is safe and tasty enough for kids to enjoy the meal. You can help them too. Cost of helping a kid for a month is less than price of a movie ticket. Let me know if you need the link to their site. 

3) I am teaching Scrum for free to everyone who is interested. I normally coach executives on implementing Scrum, but right now, I am coaching whoever is interested. 

4) I am also looking to help small businesses who might need software development work. If you know anyone who might need support for their existing tooling or need a new product or just maintenance of their website, reach out to me. You can send me a private message and I will share my contact information. I will be able to help for 4-5 hours per day at best.

5) I started a small exercise group in my PG to alleviate the lack of gym. 

If you have something that we can help with, please post here. If you need any help with software development work, send me a message.

People are so ignorant.,i_try_my_best_okay," Not only chicken, people have stopped feeding eggs to their kids..

Ha animal milk is ok, no corona there.../s

At the end of all this mess we will have a generation of protein deficient kids...

Good, We will get chicken at cheap prices.

on the other hand one day These Idiots will get Eggs and Chicken banned by modiji, so enjoy while you can.

It has nothing to do with corona/food science  people are tagging their caste habits to a disease, half of India now secretly thinks untouchability was the right thing..we might start getting whatsapp messages soon on caste-discrimination is besht.. There's a fake rumor on WhatsApp that chicken causes coronavirus.

Good news is, prices have dropped a lot.

But people could stop selling chicken entirely so that could be messed up. China also just culled a large amount of birds due to Avian Flu (i think it is). Maybe that’s normal practice - can’t be too careful at the moment. I avoid farm-bred chicken (broilers) - to avoid the yuuge quantities of antibiotics that goes into those. 

Nothing to do with Corona. 

Properly cooked chicken won't give you the bird flu either. 

The current disaster in the poultry markets is just cuz of paranoia + ignorance. Same as people peddling tulsi leaves, etc. Mainly out of fear from bird flu (which has been reported from Kerala, I think), but of course, also because of general fear based on the COVID-19 infection originally coming from meat, and that information being mangled by the geniuses who run India's WhatsApp University. I'm from Mysore, and there's this bird flu in Karnataka Kerala region. Don't know about rest of the India though Reason why I am not eating: https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bird-flu-cases-add-to-the-woes-of-poultry-rearers/article31093908.ece Hey I am , bought 5 kilos just yesterday >_> 1. Fake news about Covid-19 being spread by it.

2. There are also cases of birdflu which are found in Philippines, Kerala and some other palaces.

Second is what people should be worried now not the first. I'll add the link for birdflu. Don't know about other parts of India, but here in Calicut there has been cases of birdflu and many chicken and birds (including pets) were killed last week.

Bas bhai news Mein importance ni hain same as 17 army man killed. Mysore, Kerala H1N1.

Milk was open as usual. In fact, many milk centers were open. My guy said they plan to remain open from 5am to 9am every day. It is a store.

The vegetable bhaiyyas were setting up when the cops came. Their major issue was the bhaiyyas clustering together and not maintaining distance. I talked to one policeman (this is a new guy, not in uniform, that I am seeing today). He said they'll let things run as long as people remain social distancing norms. They also don't want people to come everyday to buy vegetables but stock up. They let me buy vegetables.

And then let him go.",runningeek," So they just beat anyone without asking them why they’re outside? i can bet many cases from yesterdays panic Hey a genuine question. Are we allowed to go out for buying essential products like milk/vegetables? I’m a freelancer. Clients have been sending me emails asking about my health and situation in India. Two reasons :

1.	Genuinely concerned to some extent.
2.	Europe and US are badly affected. They need someone reliable and affordable to depend on. They’re laying their staff off left and right and need someone to take over their roles, so more work for me.

While most of the world is affected, my demand is skyrocketing. With dollar being stronger than ever, it’s resulting in great conversion rates to Rupee.

Weird turn of events really. Stocked up long ago, just went out in the morning to withdraw cash just in case. Cops are forcing local kirana shops to only allow 5 people in the store max.

There was one kirana store which didn't allow people inside but told them to send what they want on sms/whatsapp and come to the store to pick up and pay only. In my city, police has set a time of 6 am to 9:30 pm in the morning and 5-8 in the evening to go out and buy groceries and they have also been calm about people going out and ask them the purpose before taking any action, although if you go out to buy groceries or milk beside the alloted time, you will be in trouble Living in a pg has some perks. I can get food for two times. And grocery store near me is always open, so I stocked for a week worth of food for lunch. 

Plus I am in self isolation for about 2 months, so it is not impacting anything. Already got most everything sorted, thankfully. Bank manager here. I am the only officer and have only one cashier .

There wasn’t any screening for travelers coming back to India from UAE but they asked us to contact them in case of Flu like symptoms.

I've seen children and woman suffering malnutrition, anemia they are highly susceptible to get inflected. A lot of Indians do get sick abroad because they have no immunity to diseases in those countries.

Always make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date guys! I'm often surprised by the poor handwashing discipline of rich educated folks.

I heard hand sanitizers are bad for you. That it kills the good germs too. Anyone know anything about that? >Nor has our bodies acclimatized to constant environmental stress that has made us inherently stronger   

Actually due to frequent exposure to many antigenic substances, Indians have higher antibody titer for many local pathogens, which renders us much more immune to them than a foreigner visiting India. [removed] If anything, the air pollution over most of India might make things worse. COVID targets the lungs. https://gph.is/1e0T1tY i still think in general indians are probably the most resistent in the world Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 

The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.

In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 

Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

Food,Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,685,eogkmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/,345,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",VelvetHedgehog," People in the Northeast do not seem to have any dietary restrictions 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GLzuKz1fuQg

However, the problem arises when bigots and racists use this to demonstrate their ‘non-Indianess’ for in their logic such people could only be ‘Chinese’ If you want to see how Caste affects the perception of non-vegetarianism look no further than Tamil Nadu. The majority of the state is non-vegetarian. It has an incredibly developed Non-vegetarian cuisine. Ask anyone outside the south about the perception of Tamilians and its always vegetarian. Majority of the reason is because outside the state the vast majority of Tamilians working are Brahmins (especially in civil service), and most of the eateries outside the state are run by Brahmins. For those that don’t know, this is Dalit cuisine

Would you eat this? Perhaps if you were starving and nothing else was available to you? That is why these people started eating them! [removed] I’m not telling everyone to eat non-veg, beef or pork. I know the last two are unfathomable for most of us. However, those that want to eat them should have no restrictions. There never used to be any such laws before and this was the traditional diet of many communities Gai doodh nahi deti hai, hum usse le lete hai. Spot on. It's not like we are an animal or nature-loving society otherwise. It's all caste, masquerading as lifestyle choices. I belong to small backwards village in UP where we didn’t have electricity until a few years ago

Outside our village was a basti of the Chamars

They certainly did not eat lithi chokha unless it was given to them as leftovers. All they were entitled to eat was the leftovers of higher castes and they used to take the joothan of both Hindus and Muslims without discrimination. I am haunted by a moment when I was around 10 years old and ran after the ice cream cycle and bought an ice cream and I was greedily eating it like a pig while a boy the same age as me but from the Chamar community was staring at the ice cream and at me and I still remember the look on his father’s face. His father wanted to buy one for his son as well and went after the ice cream man. My mother told me to eat it away from them so that they cannot see and ‘najar nahi lagegi’ 

They ate pig and breed them and would sacrifice a pig every year to their caste god. They also ate the flesh of all dead animals. They ate lizards, jackals, mongoose I don't get the cow fascination most cows are domesticated so they grow up for sole purpose of feeding milk to the population so why get offended when people eat it I mean the cow served same purpose in both cases to feed people, I will never get the cow thing it's so stupid. 
My great grandfather(Brahmin) moved to West Bengal and since then most of our family members are non vegetarians but still beef is very sensitive topic. I hope someday we can see through this bs it's a domesticated animal people stop getting offended. I am sorry but you are using the words ""Indian"" and ""caste"" very vaguely. I am an upper caste Brahmin from the Bengal originally and there is no such restriction for any caste. In fact even the ""pujari"" eats non veg after doing puja, in fact he is fed before everyone else can eat. Also, same is the case in kashmiri shaivism and a lot of other tantric sects as well. 

It is only a few ""elitist"" brahmins (mostly vaishnavites). Who promote such ideas and should be looked down upon because they spoil the name of Hinduism. We are a very vast culture with many schools of thought we can't demean Hinduism entirely just because a part of it is very casteist. We need to learn, re-write and re-narrate Hinduism to the masses.

There is a lot of hindutva propaganda. But let's try to see though it and not kill beef eaters or look down upon meat eaters. 

PS: I did upvote because you started a great convo here. We need more and more diverse voices Just like everything else in india Such hypocrisy is ripe in India and I personally feel there is a need for drastic change that would make the society casteless and classless may be I’m wrong but it’s time for a change in mindset of people. Of course most people in this country don't actually care about animals. We all see and ignore the plight of street animals every single day. By that argument are Jains and Bhuddists also forcing vegetarianism ? Or is it only the Brahmins who are espousing vegetarianism on everyone. 

Kshatriyas were warriors and kings. They ate meat. So to say vegetarianism has to do a lot with casteism is being a bit dishonest. 

Indian cuisine is one of the few which organically has so much vegetarian food choices instead of just meat substitutes. It is sad that even that is used to fuel hatred on this sub. 

Hope you find peace OP. What is this? Bootleg scroll article? This write up is sprinkled with gems like,

>Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power **being forced on** the non-vegetarian majority – **with their consent**.

>The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Hmm what?? Why is this nonsense just there right in the middle without any preface and conclusion?

And wonderful theorem proving techniques. To prove,

>**Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals**

Goes on to assume the same thing,

>The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity.

*Proof:* Assume theorem is true => Theorem is true now. Done<>

There are many things wrong with caste, but vegetarianism isn't one of them. So vegetarianism is bad because of Brahmins? I feel nowadays caste based vegetarianism is like forced practice I have friends who belong to the swami caste yet they eat meat and stuff outside in secret and practice vegetarianism at home. This is pure BS.  

People are non vegetarian because that comes naturally to them and easily accessible. In today's world we don't even need to rely on meat as we can get majority of required supplements with veg counterparts and remaining can be found in eggs. Most Baniyas/Vaishyas are vegetarian. Kshatriyas have a high percentage of meat eaters. Any “ism” is more about moral superiority than the real thing. Absolutely. We're a hypocritical bunch with dung for brains. If we had the sense to look beyond Brahmin India, we'd see how people thrive with non-vegetarian food in their diets. It's beyond cringe to see our athletes against say, Australian or New Zealand athletes. When we moved to the UK initially we had the problem of halal haram coming from a Muslim family but later we decided to abandon these customs for a few reasons:

1. In this country you cannot see the animal being slaughtered, so you do not really know if it is halal and since most of the animals are stunned beforehand, it so not valid. Thus you cannot be sure of the provenance of meat even if it is from a halal animal

2. It is not convenient to be restricted to certain foods. We lived in a White British area and not some Desi ghetto where everything is halal or vegetarian. Most of the things I grew to like actually consumed pork such as sausages, pate,  etc. Which either my parents knew had pork but did not care or they really didn’t know

3. Islamophobia and also the mentality of most Muslims in modern times makes me want to distance myself from them

4. Me and my father, mother are technically atheist or agnostic, so why not eat pork?

5. I used to try to be vegetarian as far as possible but I love meat too much so it didn’t last long I'm an avid non vegetarian. I don't crave pork or mutton coz i much rather prefer the chicken-egg-fish combo.

If you have to bring it up to castes well even among the so called brahmins there are sub casts and I happen to belong to top of them. And in my entire region, across casts and whatever subsections you want to indulge in or care for, having the ability to have fish regularly is among the top prosperous blessings our ever so orthodox ancestors can bestow upon us.

While it's easier to chalk it up to caste. The choice and stigma of vegetarianism is more about the region and the kind of people who've rose to power in those regions from ancient times. But most of it lies with people who cling to unfounded beliefs in the name of ""culture"" and not having the sense or ability to question why things are so.

PS: pretty much any class of people have had access to and have consumed some section of non vegetarian food. Just go through the manuscripts from the courts of any kings and such you can get your hands on. Bengali brahmins eats fish. It has nothing to do with caste but everything to do with religion. Naturally some random beliefs might get right. Definitely nothing to do with compassion for animals either. BS ->
>As is common knowledge, 

Common knowledge is WRONG, all the time, not most of the times, all the times. 


>the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet

Wrong again, the mostly part is wrong as well as the entire sentence 



>, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously

Who told you? 



>is much higher than among those who are not from these communities

This proves nothing and helps in NO WAY to make the point you are trying to make. 



> The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians

This proves nothing, and you have no data to proof this, and you have not even defined the higher and lower. Your ranking of higher and lower is based upon an argument you tried to make before, which makes your assertion circular, ergo no signal but noise. 


> burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Who told you?  It is not a burden but a choice. Just because you cannot accept other women's choices does not mean your labelling of their choice as burden is correct. 




>of moral power of minority within Hindus

Wrong again

> be if they feel threatened by the introduction

Circular argument again, it's their choice, and it their right to protest. It is their right to PROTEST AGAINST THE THINGS THEY DO NOT LIKE. just because you do not like their rights and choices does not mean you are correct. Do not poke your nose into other's people choices and rights. 

> In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung

One who eats beef by slaughtering underage calf is NOT the same as one who eats beef of buffallows. 




The above write up a anti semitic and calls for voliance upon bhramins, just like the naxzis do and continue to do so. 




The tax paying citizen [ net + ve tax paying [ no reservation, no govt aided college and medicare ] ] is an asset, not a libilaity. [removed] Ambedkar also wrote about it in one of his books To clarify I am not against vegetarianism itself, it is actually a good thing but it is not good to force it upon poor Indians who have historically suffered great injustices and many still do. If you can afford to chose what you want to eat, that’s great but remember not everyone is able to chose. very true Unfortunately, in Hinduism, certain animals are considered more valuable than certain categories of humans. gohatya or slaughter of cows is a grave sin, perhaps only superseded by brahmahatya  or killing of Brahmins. Why are you replying to your own post.You can edit it. They say that non veg makes your mind dull (which is complete bs btw), to them, I say, Einstein and Newton weren't vegetarians.. I agree with your heading. In India vegetarianism is like that. But you are going too much extreme on other side and getting preachy . Let people eat whatever they want. This post reminds me of the L. K. Advani interview with his wife, where she blurted out that his favourite food was chicken hearing this Advani was visibly perturbed/embarassed and negging her to shut up. > ""People who committed big sins in past life, have been forbidden to enjoy tasty (non-veg) food in this life""

I use this to shut down any vegetarian who pretends to be morally superior as I much on my chicken/fish/beef/pork :) Bang on!

You forgot the main aspect that connects the caste system and diet - untouchability! 

I get people getting nauseated due to the smell. But there's whole different untouchability I have witnessed where the vegetarians don't want people eating non veg on same table to touch their food or even use same spoons. As if some minute particles of non veg are gonna spoil their purity.

And another mistake we do is restricting this discussion to Brahmins. The Jains are vociferously pungent about non vegetarians. Most of the shit non vegetarians receive comes from them! I sometimes wonder how every discussion somehow excludes the nasty practices of that community. I felt very much in two minds when I visited India as a vegetarian (vegetarian for ethical reasons). I was of course absolutely delighted to have so many options when it came to food, and it never felt like the food I had was prepared as an afterthought. In Western countries, you're sometimes lucky if there is one vegetarian option on a restaurant's menu, and that itself will often be ""Please ask your waiter"". This roughly translate as ""Ask us, and we'll go through the back of the fridge and maybe the peels from yesterday, fry up what we find, throw some soy sauce over it and sell it to you as stir-fry for €20"". So having so many choices and such delicious options was a fantastic experience for me.

However, when I chatted with my colleagues while there, I had more than one of them mention to me how some of their family members would use their vegetarianism almost like a weapon. One told me that he and his wife were no longer vegetarian, and consequently her parents had cut contact for years. Even after they had re-established contact, they would not set foot into the non-veg couples house for a long time. They now do come and visit, but the couple have to ""cleanse"" the house before the parents arrive, to make sure that there is no meat in the house at all. Not even powdered chicken stock. And no eggs in the fridge, either.

Another told me that an aunt of hers, when going out with the rest of the family to eat at a restaurant, will bring her own food. And she's only started doing that after not having had a meal with her family for years.

It really made me sad to hear about all this. Sharing food is such an important aspect of companionship, family and culture, and to break that so callously and brutally is beyond my comprehension. I really appreciate this post. It actually came up recently in another thread I was in. I like that you wrote this without criticising any one section. Vegetarianism in India is one of the great plagues forced upon the masses. If we could eat beef and pork and other meat then we would never go hungry. The Chinese eat everything, learn from them. They have survived some of the worst famines in history yet they are thriving PETA, celebrities and Westerners need to stop endorsing vegetarianism (and even worse, veganism) in a developing 3rd world country where most of the people suffer from hunger. It makes me sick when Westerners praise Indians for their non-violent vegetarianism. Sure, Indians can’t hurt cows but they have no issue lynching a human that supposedly ate one Fantastic points put forward. Vegetarianism is form of elitist thinking and lifestyle and it's also repressive. Live and let live, and let people eat what they want ffs. Ugh!
And the virtue signaling in social media.
Every single time when there is a forest fire, this same group couldn't stop posting about meat industry's 3% contribution to global warming.

I'm like.. 
Yeah? The forests stop burning if malnutrition becomes the global standard?

You don't eat meat because of your fucking scriptures you idiot, don't pretend like you care about the planet.

The same people do not care about anything else that is happening in India! From what I understand, the food choices do not just come on the basis of casteism. The lack of means to buy non vegetarian products has also been a factor driving many people towards vegetarian cuisine.

the same logic applies to the ingredients that going to the preparation of the food. For example, lot of red chili being used so as to hide/cloud the missing taste of other masalas which are rather expensive.

Your post maybe correct in criticising the old practices, but I believe people nowadays have less qualms about these things. Some people who were brought up vegetarian choose to stay the same and not because they despise the sight or smell or what have you. The ones who were closet non-veg eaters nowadays don't have a problem discussing the same with family. Well not exactly _discussing_ but still their family knows and sometimes they may joke about it.

I myself belong to vegetarian family, baniya Agrawal. My mom won't allow any of the non veg item being prepared inside. With Uber eats, at least we started to get the cooked items inside!
Anyway, she's finding it hard to allow eggs to be stored or cooked, even though given my diseases and high protein requirements it's essential. The _boomers_ have a little hard time in giving up old practices. If you replace that vegetarianism with English language in India and non vegetarianism with the desi languages we will reach the same conclusion , the thing is poor people always follow the rich people not the other way around Root cause is not caste hierarchy. Root cause is some principle behind a caste not wanting to consume meat. It's a stupid argument, comparing caste hierarchy to love for animals. You should rather compare the reason why certain castes want to follow vegetarianism. I wonder when people of kolkata are forced to try Jain/Marwadi Veg food Are you against animal agriculture or for it? I would like to make a new post now because at this point there are too many comments to reply individually so apologies for this. Also thanks for the silver!

Ok so title states that Indian vegetarianism has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals. That does not mean caste system is the reason for vegetarianism. I apologise if at any time I made it appear that way. Religion, region and availability of ingredients as well as economics are also very important factors 

I also apologise for hurting sentiments of anyone, in no way do I mock anyone for holding cow sacred, but the truth is that cows in India are sadly not thriving, most as seen on the road side are actually struggling to survive. We can argue that at least they are free unlike other countries where they are kept in poor welfare farms and abused for meat and dairy etc.

I am not against any community or caste, I am merely against discrimination, a lot of which is so deeply rooted in our society that we have been blinded to a large extent. I believe people should be able to eat what they want

The reason I posted parts of this article from 2017 is because it is still valid and the whole thing has some unnecessary details, otherwise I could have just posted a link to the original. I elaborated my own views and opinion in the comments 

As we can see society is changing and attitudes, not always for the better unfortunately 

Being Vegetarian is good but eating meat is not bad. Yes vegetarianism nowadays will benefit the environment but it not be forced on anyone. The poorest of the poor should have the right a balanced proper diet. They have historically eaten meat so it is unfair to take that away from them as well and advocate them to eat plant based substitutes, so much has already been taken away from them.

Peace and prosperity 

Bharat mata ki jai! Can anyone tell why specifically cow was chosen to be revered and not buffalo? I don't think this is a sound model considering that the fraction of meat eaters don't follow the caste hierarchy, I mean if Caste Hierarchy is Brahmins > Kshatriyas > Vaishyas > Shudras, then going by your explanation the fraction of meat eaters should be in the order of Shudras > Vaishyas > Kshatriyas > Brahmins, but it's more like Shudras > Kshatriyas > Brahmins > Vaishyas. I have seen a lower number of Baniya caste people who are non-vegetarians as compared to Brahmins.

Plus eating meat is more like function of how religious someone is (if meat eating is forbidden in the version of religion in their region), behavioral inertia, and economic situation. Expanding on the last one, Dalits of my village are pretty well to do, I mean you wouldn't notice when you enter lower caste neighborhood, so eating meat for them is not a matter of survival, and behavioral inertia and religious beliefs take over.    

Also I don't think we should be discussing this, because it is implicitly persuading people to eat meat. Currently nearly all meat is industrially produced which results in great suffering for the animals involved, is bad for health and have massive environmental impact. Beef is worst of all, especially the cattle reared solely for slaughter. 

A cow needs to be fed 20+ tons of food and even greater amount of water before it's ready for slaughter in two years, in the meantime it has produced 10s of tons of methane and carbon dioxide. Then you kill it to obtain a few hundred kilograms of meat. This is horrible conversion ratio of resources.  

We have raised cattle for generations, so take it from me that you need at least half acre land to support one cow. Now on one hand you ear mark half acre for two years and then you will get say 300 kg of meat, or you could grow 8 different crops in the meantime which will give you much greater amount of food products, and capture some CO2 in the meantime. I don’t see it as such a problem in Punjab. I suppose it’s because caste hierarchy isn’t as big of an issue as it is in other states. It’s an issue but not as prominent I think. PART 1 \[PART 2 posted as a reply to PART 1\]:

For **TLDR** scroll to the bottom of the comment (PART 2).

\-------

Vegetarianism is the natural course any civilization would follow in a country with the geographical conditions such as India's. And vegetarianism as a cultural phenomenon (religion, caste, etc.) is merely a consequence.

Let me explain this.

We have one of the most fertile plains in the world, created due to the the extensive river network throughout the subcontinent, the most prominent ones being the Indus river plains and the Ganga river plains (630 million acres) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic\_Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic_Plain))

For the climate that early Indians were exposed to, the terrain and the geographical conditions they lived in, agriculture was the most optimal means to feed the society. As a side note, agriculture and relative isolation is the main reason for such explosive population. The conditions were similar for china too. (This research paper illustrates the correlation between agriculture and explosive population growth ([https://www.nature.com/articles/16339](https://www.nature.com/articles/16339))

Now compare this with China.

China, like India has an extensive river network throughout the early Chinese civilization positioned on the east of Heihe-Tengchong line, where to this day, 94% of the population resides. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heihe%E2%80%93Tengchong\_Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heihe%E2%80%93Tengchong_Line))

China also has two prominent rivers, namely, Yellow river and the Yangtze river, which led to a network of multiple fertile plains, the most prominent being northeastern Chinese plain. This is also where the earliest Chinese civilization existed ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast\_China\_Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_China_Plain)) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow\_River\_civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River_civilization))

Agriculture, like in India, was naturally adopted in China too, given the climatic, geographical conditions of the country. This again lead to the explosive population growth in China, like in India. ([https://www.nature.com/articles/16339](https://www.nature.com/articles/16339))

Now, let's analyze the vegetarianism aspect of this situation.

Like India, China also had a long history of vegetarianism, mainly due to the agricultural development the civilization witnessed (This later changed, people did eat ""weird $hit""; Mongols have a significant contribution to meat eating culture in China, again, due to Mongolian geography). ([https://ivu.org/history/east/china.html](https://ivu.org/history/east/china.html)) Huan Tsang also notes that Indian upper castes were predominantly vegetarian. ([https://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson9/chapter03.html](https://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson9/chapter03.html))

Comparing this to non-agricultural civilizations (more appropriately, settlements and nomads) found mainly in central, western Asia, Europe and Mid-Africa, where agriculture was difficult, people resorted to meat consumption. The first meat production/culturing (NOT consumption; early Homo sapiens ate meat too but they weren't civilized yet) took place in western Asia, which then spread to central Asia and Europe. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#History\_of\_meat\_production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#History_of_meat_production))

Not only India and China, most ancient agricultural civilizations like East (China, Japan), South East, Mediterranean basin adopted vegetarianism. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_vegetarianism#Ancient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_vegetarianism#Ancient))

And before you claim that I'm upper caste hindutva guy and a bigot (like you've done in this comment section already), I'm neither of those. I’m not attacking any ‘caste community 
There is merely an evil mindset that must be changed for the sake of India. This evil has been going on for far too long and it will one day encompass all of us if it remains unchecked. Case in point, what is happening to our country today Da fuq ? Why is your post word-to-word copy of [this 2017 article](https://scroll.in/article/833178/vegetarianism-in-india-has-more-to-do-with-caste-hierarchy-than-love-for-animals) OP. Care to reply? If you look at the terminology we use

Pure veg 

Non-veg

These are unique to India

Pure veg apparently does not even include onions and garlic and masoor dal as well as mushrooms and more. It is basically the Sattvik diet. It includes yoghurt, milk, ghee, butter. Sometimes vegan tourists mistake pure veg for vegan but that is not the case. Pure veg is for the purest castes

Non-veg is unique to India because vegetarian is not considered the norm in other countries thus the term is not used. ‘Meat’ or protein is used instead Everything I have said is true. People downvoting my comments on this thread are either bigoted/prejudiced or content with ignorance and want to keep the lower castes oppressed [removed] I call this BS.I come from a vegetarian family, been one my whole life. Never witnessed any caste or religion based discrimination. India is too big for such broad generalizations, I can speak for North Indians (Punjabis, including Delhi) are mostly vegetarians and also the most cosmopolitan of Hindus and have the least level of discrimination based on caste, religion or race. I have second hand knowledge for rest of India, still the love, respect and acceptance of animals in India is impressive and admirable.

Whatever the reason may be how Hindus arrived to this but Vegetarianism is the future and the way to go. Vegetarianism and respect for all lives is only increasing in the world, it is actually one of the most important strategies to manage climate change and its impact. I know about 100+ vegetarians, except for the handful religious nutjobs, nobody cares about caste or ""purity"". 

Most vegetarians do not want meat because of the eek factor, the smell or death, the whole idea of boiling dead bodies and eating flesh is insane, disgusting and most importantly extremely disturbing.

Literally, no shops for them to wiggle with a happy face to a stranger who is smoking enjoying a cigarette or eating from roadside kada. Not gonna happen. They die if they don’t eat for 5 to 8 days. 

- Leave a bucket of water and refill it repeatedly everyday (it’s important to keep them Hydrated). *not small bowl* 

- Leave the left overs and extras if you’re not eating it.

- Leave the bones if you’re eating non veg.

- tell them you’re there for them. 

PS: food on roof for birds too.

>“large number of animals suffer and die and carcasses of dead animals and birds may further spread different diseases among community which will be difficult to control”

Edit: Animal birth control and water management lacks in India. Most of them live near garbage. If the garbage is not removed, dogs are not. 

We can blame the government for poor/no control policies including spaying and neutering, which would have possibly helped avoid some of the current problems. Stop blaming the fucking dogs.

NGO have already started working on street dogs in a more organised way. 

Please stop talking like a toddler with half baked brain. Without knowing their potential and not acknowledging them properly you cant expect them to behave the way you want. We are the educated dumbasses on this planet simply blaming animals for what we did.",dingdongmafia," I'm currently in Gandhinagar, Gujarat and the street dogs here are so weak because people only ever feed cows. The dogs even eat rotis and Vegetables because they literally have no other choice and due to this coronavirus, we aren't even having chicken to spare bones for them. People in my society run over puppies no joke. I had to once remove the dead body of a puppy from the road in front of me Because people were just running him over and over. Fucking asses think they are NASCAR drivers in a single lane road. Full disclosure: i love dogs.. But no street dog eats whenever i give them anything... I fail to understand this... This is grtting ridiculous... Wtf!!? if the government does its fucking job there should be no street dogs, fucking 3rd world So you're saying a fringe benefit of the lockdown is that the stray dog problem may be solved? Don't feed dogs and pigeons in cities they are a menace. I hate those fucking street dogs! 

I know I would get a lot of heat for this, but I do. I suffer from a debilitating rare condition which makes every sound too painful for me, so much that I can’t even move or speak. 

And when I am in my bed laying, contemplating how my life turned out to be like this at 24 yo, and getting enough rest to face another painful day, those motherfuckers will just bark and bark and bark. 

I have tried countless things, like asking the rwa about a solution, going to animal control and they just tell me that they’ll simply steralize them but they’ll stay there. Like i want them to stop barking right outside my house! NGOs won’t take them because they already have so much of them.

And then I sleep in excruciating pain with no medicine and no treatment for the rest of my life. 

So sorry, fuck those stray dogs! One of my neighbors feeds the stray dogs in my street and I welcome it. They even, out of their own money, sterilized few of those dogs, while few of the remaining were sterilized by govt workers.

However, my other neighbors are always furious with them. They say that these people should stop feeding them. The arguments they make are:

* These dogs are chasing after vehicles and new people which is dangerous.
* Because you are feeding, they are staying here. Otherwise, they would have gone.

Here is my point:

* If we stopped feeding them, they would search for food on streets. Combine it with Swach Bharat. They may be forced to forage in drainage and dump yards. What if they get sick? What if they get worms? What if those worms somehow transfer to humans living nearby?

We have 2 options (a combination of the two can be used too):

* Sterilize all stray dogs (wait for them to die off) and
  * Feed them (a humane way IMO)
  * Stop feeding them (this may lead to unintended bad things like I said before)
* With active public and private participation, push for the adoption of these dogs
  * Govt making a dedicated branch for Dog related issues and give sufficient funds. NGOs must also work with them.
  * Create active campaigns motivating people to also adopt indigenous dog breeds.

Dogs were domesticated thousands of years ago. I think, along with sterilizing stray dogs, feeding them is the least we can do until our govt decides to spend significant resources to solve this issue. Unpopular opinion : we should not have street dogs . [removed] Please feed the dogs, they aren't bad and are most are very friendly. It's not their fault that the government didn't sterelize dogs in the begging, it's not their fault that they were born. They don't deserve to go in such a inhumane way. The world is theirs as much it is ours, coronavirus has taught us that. 

Speaking from personal experience, they are very intelligent and have emotions, they can understand everything.

Please feed them, if you save one life, maybe the good Karma will circle back and help you fight the virus.",2020-03-24 05:19:17

Edit: Added original article link that is going viral.",amzed_can," Have you posted this on Facebook? I want to share this Great work on the replies and the links! I would suggest adding more, and as many as possible (we can help!) so this becomes a sort of mega post with sources that we can share with whoever encourages stupidity and blind worship of the govt. I see that the original article has no links or sources where as you provided sources. That's what these people do they rely on their flimsy opinion as whatsapp needs no sources but to prove them even to people that don't support them they need sources. Anyway great work. The fuck the target post reads like my 6th standard school essay. What shitty level of sycophantic behaviour is this. Isn't this the same article that was posted on rediff ? Who even believes this is written by someone who is not a BJP supporter? I don't even bother getting into an argument with people who post these (which rather sadly was done by atleast 5 people on my timeline who went to premier institutions in the country - all were priveleged upper class Hindus even before I met them during my post grad). I feel like it's impossible to change someone who is well read and still blindly supports everything the government does. The chance that they will turn on BJP at some point of time is the same as me voting for BJP anytime in the future. I wasn't a big fan of Modi (2002 riots) but was hopeful of a sea change in India's development and corruption with the majority they had. 5 years of Modi has all but buried that hope forever. In a country of 1.3 billion people it's a miracle we have a PM that an overwhelming majority would listen to and I would love to be proved wrong about him by the way he leads us through this crisis. Our economy is going to take a while to recover with the US economy already crashing but if we come out of this with competitively less human casualty I would he appreciative of Modi for doing so This is my take from it.

You dont just understand that no matter what steps the government takes, it just cannot fulfiil each and condition you have put up here.

When you have a large, diverse country there will always be short comings and many will latch on to the shortcomings while ignoring anything of substance being done.",2020-04-04 18:33:08
Food,What can i feed my cat?,10,frjoqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frjoqf/what_can_i_feed_my_cat/,22,My City has entered into complete lockdown. No one goes out. No milk and vegetables sellers n the street either for next few days. I am going to run out of cat food in next 7-8 days. What can i feed her?,bstumpm4w," The best alternative is to get formula (baby food). You can also get milk powder (NOT WHITENER for tea/coffee - check the ingredients carefully) from all grocery stores. I'd always keep a stock of 3-5 1kg packs. Do you have any at home? 

Hopefully it will be possible to go to the grocery shops. Or order this^^ stuff online and get it quickly - hopefully. 

Worst case, cat can survive on rice and dal - boiled, no spices. Bad choice, but better than starvation. Get the cat used to it already - let it starve for 1-2 hours beyond usual feeding time. Then offer it a small amount of rice+dal. And then cat food. You have to ""train"" it to take to a new food. If you're lucky it will like it automatically. Try different ways - watery/dry rice/dal, or roti soaked in dal. Feed your cat 10-20% less than normal if you're concerned. Will make the supply last one or two more days. Hopefully your city's situation will be a bit better by then. She's five months old so baby formula - no special flavoured- will work. You can get that at a medical store. [removed] Pet food shops should be open as it’s an essential service.

Take proper precautions and go get some food. How old is she?",2020-03-30 11:48:11

Iirc there was something very brief about the killing of jews as a result of ww2. Is it a political thing?,i_try_my_best_okay," CBSE did. A huge ass chapter on the Holocaust. You might even heard about Holocaust, but never about 1943 famine of Bengal where 3 million perished, because all the food supplies were diverted towards War efforts. My assignment in class 10 was on the Holocaust. It is in the CBSE History textbook but it's an optional chapter. It didn’t directly impact Indians as we were too busy facing the atrocities by the British .Even our own struggles barely gets a mention . My guess is that India had so much going in the country at that time as in they were under opression and later they got busy trying to get east india company out n all. Western history is not as important/relevant to India considering their history books are heavily censored and are supposed to be politically correct. 
It is important to note that history in western schools doesnt cover a lot of whatever happened in India 100 years ago. Every country educate their future generation with history n facts concerning their own country, everything else is extra knowledge that can be found in libraries and internet if people care. Because Hitler helped Bose hehehe.

/s Because that's not part of our History or had any direct  relation to our freedom struggle.

Our history is one of vast in the world starting with Indus valley civilisation to Independence which the curriculum struggles to cover. It was mentioned in Class 10th History Books. I guess history has so much content from each and every country on this planet that our books prefer to stick to our own core content and briefly gloss over other big world event. Because someone can tommorow ask the same thing you asked but for topics like Apartheid or Spanish inquisition. Honestly who cares about holocaust ?

It's not even relevant or useful",2020-03-26 10:17:28

Women have face life long sufferings due to this biological phenomenon ..... They have been discriminated against for being impure ? What a thinking ! 👏👏👏👏 Finally, some good fucking news here!! Wrong step.. Hear me out..

The stupid priest want to create a connection between the cooking and the periods. Periods are OK. Cooking is ok. The portrayal of connection is bad. By organising this, they associated food with periods thereby highlighting the connection. Its the same as we have shit in our stomach too all time and we eat food from mouth. But we never choose to notice this fact bcoz this connection is not that good to think on. The stupid priest won in a way Cool!

My question is 4 folds.
1) how popular is the street food culture in urban India?
2)Do you regularly go to the same vendor to eat the food?
3) How easy is it to order delivery of street food to you home? Does the vendor provide you that service? Or you have to physically go and collect it?
4) do you care that the vendor has a FSSAI certification(food safety) or would it encourage you u to eat at a stall who has this",indivc," 1) Extremely popular. An FICCI report on food industry provides that around 70% of all food in India is eaten from unorganized food vendors (roadside food stalls, dhabas, chaat shops and tea shops). I go to particular vendors for particular food products rather than to one vendor as a habit.

2) The delivery charges would end up higher than the food cost. The very attraction of a street vendor is the immediate accessibility and cost benefit. Introducing a third party with his own profit margins for delivery may not work out. 

3) Absolutely not. I would rather eat in a street where I can see the food being prepared and most of the street food vendors, atleast my preferred ones, take immense pride of cleanliness and food safety. Over time, since most of the customers would be repeat for a street food vendor near a college or place of work, it is in their interest to keep the hygiene above the acceptable level. I would rather not trust the restaurants where I am oblivious as to what happens in the dungeon of a kitchen. I trust the FSSAI even less. Health inspection in restaurants is a farce in my city. 1) very popular
2) yes
3)most street vendors don't provide home delivery since they are usually the only ones running the stall. You have to collect it physically
4) I personally don't care, as I said these are single person or couple run businesses. Usually the wife cooks the food and the husband sells it. They don't have the means to get an FSSAI certification So an the benifits of a 'zomato + swiggy for street food vendors' won't have any real benefit or solve a real problem",2019-12-26 17:07:34

> A seemingly innocuous advertisement of the beverage, released in September 2018, was retrieved from the archives of the world wide web to give parent company Hindustan Unilever (HUL) a hard time.

> The ad shows a Hindu man approaching a Ganpati idol-maker to take home a murti of Bappa for the first time. The elderly idol-maker offers parcels of knowledge about Hindu traditions and tales to his customer, leaving the man suitably impressed. But then, because it’s time for his namaaz, the idol-maker puts on a skull cap, revealing his Muslim identity. The Hindu buyer is surprised, feels betrayed and disappointed.

> *“I have some work today, I’ll come back tomorrow,”* he says, excusing himself from the interaction.

> The idol-maker asks him to at least stay for (Red Label) tea. Facilitated by a glass of chai, the Hindu man’s bigotry disappears when the Muslim man explains why he does what he does: *“Bhaijaan, yeh bhi toh ibadat hai”* (Brother, this is also worship).

> The last frame reads, *""Inspired by a true story.""* Boycott culture has officially entered India, but unfortunately, it won't work because most companies in India are monopolies, even the so called bhakts would find it difficult to find alternatives to these everyday things. Perhaps that is why Patanjali is present, but even then, it is sub par and so the Bhakts will silently revert to the quality products they used previously. I searched for the Red Label ad on YouTube and this was the first search result - https://youtu.be/l99pVT8MOXQ

I am speechless 😶. Bhakti is really blind. No one actually follows this in real life outside of twitter.

People think twitter represents India and thats just so false. Why do people think that twitter is real India? People wanted to boycott surf excel but nothing happened. People wanted to boycott Zomato but nothing happened.

We Indians just suck at protests and boycotting. Extremists (Of every religion) are trash. And its sad to see that in this day and age, they have the louder voice in our country. I don't even know where our country is going anymore. 
""Secular"" is only used in political propaganda and the true meaning of it is already being forgotten. Why are religious people even allowed to sue others with the reason of 'X's words hurt my faith' thats stupid because as an atheist their words hurt my ideology when they force me to pray but can I sue them? No.
Despite having freedom of religion, we still are not free. [deleted] [deleted] I don’t give a shit about religion but don’t you think showing hindus always as intolerant and showing muslims as good hearted kinda defeats the purpose of these videos?.

Food,Anyone worried that a Riot might break out ?,26,fr4txk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fr4txk/anyone_worried_that_a_riot_might_break_out/,12,"While the Lockdown is happening with varying degrees of effectiveness across the country, there are many who criticize its implementation and effectiveness. But what's done is done and there's no use debating it further, atleast until all of this blows over.

What I am worried about is people feeling like they are being repressed against their best interests and retaliating en masse.

Currently, the people are ignoring the Lockdown due to two reasons.

1. They don't understand the seriousness of the situation. 

2. They don't have enough supplies and/or are worried about their survival

The Police cracking down on them using violence might instill the idea that the Lockdown is implemented not for their benefit. A lack of certainty about essential commodities adds more fuel to the fire. Reading about the situation in Goa, I couldn't help but feel that the people are on the verge of their breaking point. And if the situation in the Hospitals reaches a point where, like in Italy, the Doctors have to choose whose life to save, I can't imagine how the people would react.

I don't mean to cause unnecessary panic or worry to the people reading this post. I just want to know whether the Government has considered this ( I am trying to be optimistic here ) and have a proper plan in place to avoid it. I would also like to know if people like me can help spread awareness and help alleviate the situation.",AnIncompleteUsernam," I think that it's a strong probability in Goa.

The CM over there has been an absolute failure in providing the essential services because a lot of their vegetables and dairy is imported from out of the state .

It's a tinderbox waiting to light up unless anything is done to resolve it If government fails at providing food and money to poor we will defined see an increase in crimes related to theft. No doubt about it. Survival nature of humans. You know why there won't be a riot? Because riots have no benefit to rich people or politicians. Hence there will be no instigations, no arming of people and whom are they gonna fight? A well armed police? It will only lead to casualty on one side. 

Maybe anger will come on street from small groups of people, and they will be killed and rest will keep shut and move on. If the police are ruthless, and do not handle themselves, the backlash could be very severe. The videos circulating of their brutality are very concerning. Police brutality lead to public taking law into their hands. YES, It happened in China today and yesterday as well! Yes, it is possible, when people are cooped up for a long time with no relief and no money and subsistence, they may rebel No, I don't think any riot would break out. If you didn’t know, already timesofindia has published a news article stating that two ISIS are travelling to somewhere in india to conduct a revenge. Gov seems to knew where they are from, which route they are taking, how many, and ToI too knew about this and published a news article, but Agencies couldn’t catch them.

Food,What are the chances that the lockdown will be extended in India,29,fsmm5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsmm5u/what_are_the_chances_that_the_lockdown_will_be/,10,It won’t make sense to lift the lockdown if the cases and deaths are increasing right ? So will the government increase the lockdown or just ignore the data.,Pseudu," 100% Without testing, quarantine could last for months. The number cases should have risen exponentially by now. It hasn't because there aren't that many tests being done. Call it the masterstrokes of a megalomaniac.

The question therefore is: Will the government choose to extend the lockdown or live with the disease? And the answer is both! India on lockdown will run the nation dry, everything is dependent on people, be it fuel, farming, agriculture or even your ATM restocking. If the people that keep the country running are forbidden to come to work, than that Maggie packet you ate will soon perish weeks from now. 

So best/worst case scenario for the government would be to have semi lockdowns. Italy is seeing a decrease in new cases after a full month of lock down. Models suggest that they may be free of the virus by mid-May. China imposed at least 2 full months of quarantine. Fortunately, the number of cases in India are not that high but enforcing proper Quarantine here won't be easy. I feel we should start t relaxing only 4 weeks after we see a dip in the number of new cases. So based on the trends in China and Italy, I think we are in for atleast 45 days of quarantine. Also, a lot depends on what is done after the restrictions are lifted. We cannot allow international passengers without testing. You know a better plan would be to not continue the lockdown.
A big part of of population specially those who depend on their jobs to get food everyday will run out of money to buy food and sooner or later they'll need to get food elsewhere. The crime rates would soar. They should keep public places shut after the lockdown but other businesses should continue otherwise millions will literally die. That way the people who can afford to can continue with social distancing and the government can swiftly manage the cases from the poor households that do come up",2020-04-01 06:14:41

Ever heard about the Russian sleep experiment? Read it and then consider it again. I did this for a couple of days and slept in my exam hall. Consider it'll end in only regret. Yo, you know, once you done with this, send me the results of what happened and if you had any hallucinations and all that stuff, and go see a god-damned psychologist. Avoid carbs and sugar. Plenty of caffeine and over the counter meds. Take some sleeping meds after the exam and sleep for a week. When you wake up this all will have been a dream Don't do this dude. You will suffer the consequences of this all-nighter week for a long time. You have enough IQ, you have enough discipline. Just forget that you will fail and just study as well as you can. Get enough sleep, be hydrated. 

Over-studying is not a good way to compensate for not meeting your expectations of success. Focus on being happy and helping other people in your life. Success will not make you happy if you were not happy before succeeding. 

My feeling is you don't want to study. But society and your peer-pressure has made you feel like you need to study to be successful. To hell with that brother. 

Just make sure you study enough to pass the exams. Even if you don't pass, don't fret. IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER!!

Find your true calling.  And fall in love with it. Do you really want to sacrifice/jeopardize your life for some stupid exam that won't matter after a month? What's the point of giving exam if you come out to be stupid and with no knowledge of the subjects. Even I don't remember most of the things I wrote in my previous semesters. Just go and sleep, eat, study without consequences, chill watching something recreational now and then. Humans are not meant to give exams. We were meant to learn and practice and fuck. That's all. So don't stress over something that is irrelevant. It doesn't matter if you pass or fail in the exam. What matters is what you can do in your life that guides humanity to a path you desire. You don't need a piece of paper to do that. Modafinil. It's available over the counter. I used that all the time in college for night outs before exams. Felt veryyyy alert.

I am on pantoprazole 40 everyday from the past 5 years. The day i stop it, it fucks me up. How do you manage to not eat food without spices and on the way not provoking the already bad ulcers in your tummy? Literally everything has spices. Even the dosas and idlies are acidic because they are fermented. Even if you ignore them, you cannot just eat them and need something to go with them. 

Any help is appreciated. 

Thanks.",NormalAdvertising," Go and see a doctor, it seems you have chronic acid reflux. Just identify trigger foods and start eliminating them. Diary, gluten, high fat, acidic foods all could create issue. 

Also there is something called rebound reflux. If you want to get out of medicines you shouldn't stop cold turkey. It has to happen over a period of a month or two specially when you have been taking PPIs for 5 years.

Get tested for Hpylori and go through the 3-course antibiotics if you are positive. Check for vitamin B12 deficiency since PPIs also cause decrease in nutrient absorption

Personally, I've been facing this and GERd since 2014. I've been able to get out of PPIs only through diet. I make my own food devoid of all trigger foods and that includes spices, high fat, oily, acidic stuff, diary and gluten. Yes, I don't eat dosas, idlis etc. However, i still have to take PPIs/H2 blockers from time to time

gerd an and gastritis subreddits are helpful. Feel free to PM me I too was on a ton of PPIs until I saw a gastroenterologist who suggested I give up dairy. Turns out, I was lactose intolerant, and my acid reflux wasn't a result of spicy foods. I was actually eating extra dairy to ""calm"" my stomach from the spicy foods, but that was literally the worst thing for me to be eating.

I'm not suggesting you are lactose intolerant, but it's worth speaking to a knowledgable gastroenterologist. Try including yoghurt in your diet. Drink raw cabbage juice 2, 3 times a day on empty stomach. 
Wheatgrass powder also helps. Also try avoiding gluten and dairy. While PPI's are generally safe and effective in treating gastritis, long term usage can be linked to nutritional deficiencies. Diet & lifestyle modification coupled with maintenance medication will enable you to get your health sorted. Check with a licensed dietician/nutritionist on how to properly go about that taking into account your dietary preferences.

Did you go to a gastroenterologist? I noticed that you said you went to a doctor but I find it concerning you were just put on pantop w.o addresing the possibility of h.pylori infection or immune system woes.

Also, a slight misconception is that spices make acidity worse. While it is true that spicy food will irritate stomach lining and aggravate ulcers, the real culprits are fats, oils & carbs leading to reflux & bloating. PPIs are also bad for the kidneys on long term usage. Have you got endoscopy done? What was the final diagonosis of your illness? Did you test for H-Pylori? Eat a lot of yogurt. I got collitis(infectious) when I was visiting India with my parents and it was a shit show. I started eating yogurt every day and my pain went away after a few weeks. I still make sure to eat yogurt 4-5 times a week and it has drastically improved my condition. That being said my collitis was caused due to an infection and inqs prescribed antibiotics for it.",2019-11-07 21:43:52

Food,An interesting observation,141,fhzqe6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fhzqe6/an_interesting_observation/,50,"I frequent a tiny tea stall next to my workplace, and the seller is a Muslim (because he wears a skullcap).

Everyday, he would give me chai in one of those earthen clay pots. Today, he asked me whether it will be okay if he offers me in a paper cup because the earthen ones are out of stock. I saw some people having tea in glass tumblers, and asked him why does he not give me in one of those?

His reply was: **""Some people don't like eating in our utensils""**. I was shocked! 

The fuck, man! I had no idea earthen pots were used for such a purpose. I thought they enhanced the taste of chai!

Edit: To everyone who thinks I am bringing up a communal angle; here are a few things. First off, I do understand the point of view of hygiene, and why people would want paper cups / earthen pots; and that is a valid reason. Personally, I prefer the clay pots or glass tumblers over paper cups because the paper is flimsy and it burns my fingers.

My shock was at the statement the chaiwalla made: to paraphrase it in vernacular, ""Oneke amader basone khete chay na"", which translates to: ""A lot of people don't want to eat / drink from our utensils"".

This is new to me in a state like West Bengal where people rarely give a shit about caste / religion, especially when it comes to food (we love our biryanis).

It could be because of hygiene (which I will ask on Monday); or it could be because he has faced discrimination. To me, the statement pointed to the latter.",futuoerectus," Hmm. I'm probably too dumb to understand this. I don't think discrimination is the sole reason for origin of ’Kulhad’. It's more sustainable than other means. Watched this [video](https://youtu.be/juJUyA49VGs) few days back and nowhere discriminatory thing is mentioned. I might be wrong, please correct me. Regardless of whether a tea seller or a small stall owner is wearing a skull cap or not, I personally prefer using disposable paper plates/ cups because I've seen how steel or glass tumblers are washed generally.

Honestly, I don't think there's anything more to it other than the fact that it's not hygienic. Clay pots are disposable. Glasses are often not cleaned after use so people tend to avoid those Not trusting the untensils of a tea stall is more of a hygiene thing

Him being muslim has nothing to do with it [removed] By ""our"" do you mean lower-class or muslim?

Because in India, it's never clear

Counter anecdote, I have some repair work going on in my house. The contractor's name is Suleiman. The two masons who work for him are named Zubair and Sumit. The welder was Irfan and the plumber was Rahul. So there's that too Hmmm, did it ever cross your mind  that people want don't use street side utensils because it's not washed properly Well i don't drink in glass utensils due to hygiene concerns, who knows if they are washing it properly or not. Disposable glasses are much better. He has faced discrimination based on class not on religion. Which, I believe 90% cases of discrimination are about.

Rich restaurants owned by Muslims would have no problem deciding what kinda plate to serve on. [removed] This was a big thing in TN and still is to some extent in rural TN but on caste basis.

I have experienced this personally on trips to rural places and they serve tea on paper or plastic single use cups for ‘outsiders’ instead of glass ones reserved for the ‘local’ people. Why bringing communal angle in everything, most chaiwala using paper cups here in my city coz they customers are fuckin scared There's a long standing fear about hygiene, it's got a lot to with caste, that might be the reason It's a very common way to discriminate. Indians are sickening. They very carefully pick and choose the worst of both colonial and precolonial times. I'm not surprised actually. It's much more common than thought. 

Please don't ask me why people never talk of this or know about it.

Such discrimination is never open.
Usually Muslims don't mind it since they need the money

we have to understand that in our country certain radical Hindus can live without interacting with minorities not the other round

P.S they usually enhance the flavour of chai so you got a good deal I might be wrong but I feel this kind of behaviour Brahmins that too from UP do. In Punjab and Delhi I have neither seen this behaviour nor someone justifying it. Brahmins here are more punjabi than hindutva types. He is right ... Its about faith. many hindus use different utensils at home for cooking meat. many times there are separate designated areas for meat cooking and eating purpose. reason , during religious festivities food offerings for god/ 'prasad' is cooked in kitchen. in some hindu homes some people eat meat some don't ( religious reasons). so cooking meat and vegetarian meal together is considered sin or impure. 
The way i see it, this is neither discrimination nor hygiene. It's 'faith'. in hinduism Earth(soil) is considered pure  just like Agni (fire). so kulhad is preferred.  it's also use and throw and less hassle for teasellers to clean.
Think this, can a devout muslim eat from same utensil/plate in which a pork is cooked or served regularly? most probably no. likewise sharing utensils with muslims or other non muslim meat eaters is not desirable for some people.
I remember similar incident last year when a hindu man  cancelled order from zomato just because delivery man was muslim. people all over the internet were bashing the guy while he clarified that it was month of Shravan ( holy month for worship of lord shiva) and many hindus even refrain from onions and garlic and muslims are known meat eaters so he considered his food 'unsacred' for being touched by a muslim delivery boy. i believe this argument is bullshit because you never know if a hindu delivery boy has eaten meat in his breakfast or not. lol . 
I personally am an atheist and this faith shit is like an abuse to me. but where faith/religion comes , rationality takes a back seat. Use the glass cup, because India needs more coronavirus cases. We are way behind other countries &#x200B;

Food,How to deal with an abusive father?,29,frmnk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frmnk0/how_to_deal_with_an_abusive_father/,34,"Hi folks,

I have been a member of this community for so long and I love this community for its progressive thoughts. I wanted to get something off my chest and also ask you folks' opinion.

I have held this off inside me for too long but today want to put it out. My father is a narcissist and manipulative person. He hasn't worked in his entire life and has only done few menial jobs for very less time. My mother has struggled hard to raise me by securing a government job with her father's and brother's efforts.

However, father has been abusive and manipulative to her and she has put up with it because of Indian society, chaar log kya kahenge bla bla. I hadn't recognised this before or tried to ignore it thinking it will be ok later and also I stay away from them since I work in a faraway city and visit them once in a while.  This time due to corona effect I had to travel since I stay alone and can't cook for shit.

Today morning again he started with his bullshit about some silly reason to her and I couldn't hold any longer and got into an argument with him to defend her. The shouting match prevailed and neighbour could hear us. After this, I realized that this is not good so I sat and tried to reason with him for almost three hours and also apologised for shouting at him. But he got only defensive and never discussed his actual feeling out but instead started blaming me and my mother about everything. It's strange that he doesn't even recognize that it is her and to some extent my hard work that is putting the food on the table.

I don't know how I will continue for remaining 15-16 days like this and how to help my mother also. Any thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading the long post.",RIndiaNeedHelp," I have been in your situation. I have hated my father ever since I was fifteen and your father sounds like a carbon copy of my father. I am 30 now. Well the first five years went into depression, wondering how he could be like this, feeling helpless about my mother. My mother was a housewife so in my case she was entirely dependent on him. When I was fifteen, instead of dressing up myself, I’d save money to dress up my mother thinking it will re-kindle some love (there had to be love right?) and stop all the fights. Nope
The next few years went into rebellion. I was staying away from them, I dated old men, weird men, horrible men, hating, hating, hating. 
Then I decided to break the pattern because mother won’t. She won’t come live with me, she won’t divorce him. I travelled solo, cried around random strangers, received kindness and love and understood the real meaning of love. Finally, when I was 28, I wrote a letter to my father, wrote a letter to my mother, and I ran away. It said that I was tired, so tired of both of them and if they want to keep me in their life for the sake of society (daughters always belong to someone else right? So our relation was a bit superficial anyway) then they needed to stop, he needed to stop abusing, she needed to stop accepting this abuse as normal and prevent it from
Passing on to my sister in law. This really shook them up and although dad is still dad, mom is still mom, they don’t fuck around me. So to answer you:
1) your dad won’t change 
2) your mother will need to stand up for herself. 
3) you need to talk to them both, you need to say no to him, and demand a no from your mother as well. 
4) Above all, you need to accept that you can only fight your own battles. Nothing will change but you will have them know who you are. You will fight not to help your mother or to change your father, you will fight to help yourself because YOU can’t stand it. 

Emotional abuse is fucked up. Sorry you are going through it. If you talk back every time he tells at your mother he may stop doing it. But what does your mother think? Does she want to separate from him and live with you instead? 1. You are right to raise your voice against the injustice towards your mom also it's a responsibility to look after her because she looked after you when you needed it the most.
2. You will have start by accepting the fact that your father is like this only, You can say ""yeah I know this thing already"", but that's not the truth, You ""know"" how it is but you have not accepted it yet.
3. Now, accepting is the first step towards finding a solution, You can't revolt against your own father if he's a lunatic, This will further escalate and won't stop until one of you will give up, For example, the incident you have just mentioned in the post, You had to give up.
4. Whatever happens between you and your father will eventually result in one thing: ""Mental suffering for your mother"", If you yelled at him and left after the lockdown he will let his frustration out on her, If the argument gets out of control and you asked her to leave with you then she will miss him no matter the way he is, most importantly for the facts ""Is he okay? How will he manage his meals? how will he manage the laundry?""

Until now I told you what can go wrong and who will suffer, Now here is what you can do:

1. Accept the fact as I told you earlier because if you won't then his every act will annoy you, Trust me, even if he will walk past you it will spoil your mood, you will be always angry and it will fuck up your ability to differentiate between what's wrong and what's right, you will react on every unnecessary act. 
2. Point it out if he's wrong, every fucking time it happens, Just notice every time his breaking point when he starts acting like a lunatic, don't push it, Point out his mistakes and when he's about to yell, you calm down even listen to his lectures for a while (here is when the acceptance part kicks in, you know all this shit already, hence no need to act, it will be tough but very easy after a while) If it happens again after a few hours then point it out again, Don't trigger his anger to make him uncomfortable.
3. After a while, he might stop doing it, which rarely happens, or he will notice that you have some authority as well, so he will hesitate to argue with you and he will have to shut up once in a while when he knows he's wrong, Just don't take advantage of this authority, when you are wrong then stay silent. Why? Because if he knows it's your fault and you are still arguing then it sends a wrong message, from next time he'll think that you just yell no matter. Sorry to say it's the same as when in a relationship your GF remembers something from 5 months old and she is operating on what happened 5 months ago and she will judge your action on what you did 5 months ago because you were wrong that time. 
4. Your neighbors know about it more than you do, Don't hesitate what society thinks about you, society is gonna talk shit one way or another, even if it ruins your image then do the right thing, you will have to make a choice ""Your mother: who did everything for you"" or  ""Your family's image in society, that society which won't even give a fuck about you if you are stuck in some issue (they might help but there is a limit, all doors close after a while)"" and in India, 95% of the times they know all this shit already.

Good luck, Ask anything if you would like to ask, Might add some points later. You just described my father. It feels like this whole fking indian culture is full of narcissists and hypocrites. These people don't have the slightest bit of sympathy for others. I don't know what I will do. I just want to run away from this shithole. My entire life I hated my father and still hate him. Sorry. Read up Anton Chekhov's experience with his father and how he dealt with it. First step, understand that your father is not gonna change. Excerpt from the book *Laws of Human Nature* by Robert Greene - Chapter 8: The Law of	Self-sabotage

>As a child, Anton Chekhov (1860–1904)—the future celebrated writer faced each morning with a feeling of dread: would he be beaten that day by his father or somehow spared? Without warning, and sometimes without any apparent cause, his father, Pavel Yegorovich, would strike him hard several times with a cane or a whip or the back of his hand. What made it doubly confusing was that his father did not beat him out of any apparent malice or anger. He told Anton he was doing it out of love. It was God’s will that children be beaten, to instill humility. That was how he had been raised, and look at what a fineman he had turned into. At the end of the beating, young Anton had to kiss his father’s hand and ask to be forgiven. At least he was not alone in this ordeal - his four brothers and one sister all received the same treatment.

......

>He had finally begun to settle down, and new thoughts and emotions came to him. Work was no longer something he dreaded; he loved absorbing his mind in his studies, and tutoring had made him feel proud and dignified—he could take care of himself. Letters came from his family—Alexander ranting and complaining about their father making everyone miserable again; Mikhail, the youngest son, feeling worthless and depressed. Anton wrote back to Alexander: stop obsessing over our father and start taking care of yourself. He wrote to Mikhail: “Why do you refer to yourself as my ‘worthless, insignificant little brother’? Do you know where you should be aware of your worthlessness? Before God, perhaps ... but not before people. Among people you should be aware of your worth.” Even Anton was surprised by the new tone he was taking in these letters.

........

>Then one day, several months after being abandoned, he wandered through the streets of Taganrog and suddenly felt welling up from within a tremendous and overwhelming sense of empathy and love for his parents. Where did this come from? He had never felt this before. In the days leading up to this moment he had been thinking long and hard about his father. Was he really to blame for all their problems? Pavel’s father, Yegor Mikhailovich, had been born a serf, serfdom being a form of indentured slavery. The Chekhovs had been serfs for several generations. Yegor had finally been able to buy the family’s freedom, and he set his three sons up in different fields, Pavel designated as the family merchant. But Pavel could not cope. He had an artistic temperament, could have been a talented painter or musician. He felt bitter at his fate—a grocery store and six children. His father had beaten him, and so he beat his children. Although no longer a serf, Pavel still bowed and kissed the hand of every local official and landowner. He remained a serf at heart.

The Solution:
>Anton could see that he and his siblings were falling into the same pattern—bitter, secretly feeling worthless, and wanting to take their anger out on others. Now that he was alone and taking care of himself, Anton yearned to be free in the truest sense of the word. He wanted to be free of the past, free of his father. And here, as he walked the streets of Taganrog, the answer came to him from these new and sudden emotions. Understanding his father, he could accept and even love him. He was not some imposing tyrant but a rather helpless old man. With a bit of distance, he could feel compassion and forgive the beatings. He would not become enmeshed in all of the negative feelings his father inspired. And he could finally value as well his kind mother, and not blame her for being so weak. With his mind emptied of rancor and obsessive thoughts of his lost childhood, it was as if a great weight had been suddenly lifted off him. A lot of good points have been made in the comments.  I would suggest giving a call to National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences Bangalore at the toll free number 08046110007. 


Just go to the roof or balcony, and see if they have some suggestions. Beat the fuck out of him. Ek baar mar padegi sub seedha ho jaega.",2020-03-30 15:56:16
Food,How I should Deal with my Father?,41,fmy2jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmy2jy/how_i_should_deal_with_my_father/,53,"P.M. Modi has said that to clap for the health and medical people around 5 PM.

I am not sure, if the people who are self-quarantined because of Janta Cerfuw (at their homes) should do it or not.

But, I am either way fine. (No argument)

**Problem**: He has a audio clip from WhatsApp which he wants to play on a Sony Stereo which requires MP3 format.

Meanwhile I was figuring out what I should be doing...

My father is kind of shouting at us: Either I will go outside and ask my friends/shopkeepers to do this tech. work for me... or you do it now. (He doesn't understand that to do some work we need knowledge for it. He doesn't understand that just because I sit on Computer, I am Bill Gates, I am Steve Jobs who knows everything)

I am just unsure, how I should deal with him right now?

Why people are not understanding the real deal about all this quarantine?

All these efforts is only to stop or limit this spread as much as possible.

But, lack of literacy is making him doing such judgement. (He is not even school passed)

If we try explaining him everything, he starts shouting at us and my mother aggressively. His facts are wrong.

Moreover, from last 2-3 days. He's bringing food from shops like Aloo Patties, Samosa. I don't know how I should deal with it.

I am kind of afraid for myself and other family members because of his decisions, we might suffer and pay cost heavily.

Just now he was shouting a lot at my mother and I am shivering. Because it has been the thing since our childhood. We have no say.

**We are a small people (middle-class and broke)**",Overall-Hope," Just google mp3 converter online I go through a similar sorta thing with my overly narcissistic and aggressively masculine dad. Tbh, there’s not much that can be done unless you can move away and live independently, both with responsibilities and financially. 

I know it’s such a pain in the ass trying to fight back with someone so one dimensional, that there’s no winning. You will instead just provoke his anger even further. Best thing would be to maintain distance and don’t take anything he says to heart. I am sorry to hear this, I hope we both can one day find a way out. Till then stay strong brother! Hey there. I'm sorry you are going through this. I, in the past, handled such situations with my father by:

A. Respond with ""okay"", ""alright"",  & ""I'll get it done""
B. Ignore your promise do whatever you want and pretend to forget whatever he wants you to do. which format is the whatsapp audio clip?? Okay ,

Solution 1) Google online MP3 audio converter, you'll get a website where you can upload the said audio and get it converted.
Maintain social distance in case you're made to go outside forcefully.

2) Don't eat from outside !! It's simply because there will be a large number of people congregating at food stalls, you never know.

Hope you get through this, I'd tie up your father to the bed for a few days if I were you. Propriety be damned. You need to start saving money in a separate account and hide it from your father. This will help make you financially independent and you can leave with your mother and sibling. Hi OP! “ Today I feel like death for me will be the ultimate freedom from him.” This struck me because that’s how I felt nearly 15 yrs ago when I was in my 12th standard. My father is exactly the same, physically and verbally abusive. He is very dominating and had set ideas what course he wanted me to study. I wanted to become a doctor, which he felt was too ambitious (no docs in family, lower middle class income only)and used to humiliate me before others for even studying for the entrance exam. I felt suicidal at times and murderous at others. My advice to you will be to persist, persist and persist a little more. And keep working towards financial independence. I went on to clear every entrance exam possible, do MBBS, MD and finally superspecialization from government colleges. He didn’t want me to join MBBS that I got in a govt college at 4000 rupees annual fees and finally our relatives had to convince him. I am financially independent now, married someone of my own choice despite his protests. However going back home is a nightmare because my father is as abusive as ever. Such people won’t change, I see him as a pathetic man who destroyed every joy from mother, brother and my life. But his abuse has been the greatest motivator for me. I recognized when I was in school that I just have it give it my all. Your life is precious and you can survive this. With the corona outbreak, things may look like they are in a standstill, but keep studying and thinking about what you will do when all this is over. Inflated ego. Problem with most of Indians. Hi! You seem to be undergoing a lot of issues at the same time. It must be very tiring for you at the emotional level. 

What I suggest you is that focus on one thing at at time. I see you worrying about other people not being informed about the reasons for quarantine and also having to deal with your father.  I suggest you focus on your immediate family first. Ensuring that he stays in as much as possible and also ensuring that you stay in as much peace as possible. 
Worrying about the purpose of lack of awareness about quarantine and  Corona is something, which all the people here are doing  however, it is something which is not in our control. It is very important that you are able to focus on things that are in your control and work on them. 

Also, seek support from another family members who have same experience as you are having. Can be your brother or sister or even mother or anyone else. Having support helps by knowing that you are not alone. 

Lastly, take some time off, maybe at night or maybe in the morning to do something which helps you de-stress and prepare for dealing with him. It's not easy but you will have to take care of yourself too. Social distancing Hi Brother,
Incredibly sorry to read about your post and your situation.

If you ever need someone to rant or to talk about your problems feel free to DM me.

Hope everything goes well for you..

Take care You need a line in aux cable bruh. It will have 3.5mm jack on both ends, one goes to your stereo the other one in your dad's phone. No conversion needed. bro the whatsapp clip is easy to format u dont need actual knowledge for it but understandable if its about ur father i would say that no point in explaining dont need to worry too much if there has been no case in ur locality stay calm no need to wry where there are cases all restros and food dinings have been closed dont wry too much beat your father if you can. that'll shut him up",2020-03-22 18:49:03
Food,What is your favourite uncommon Indian food?,40,d4mw1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4mw1d/what_is_your_favourite_uncommon_indian_food/,60,"Mine is ""pork cooked with bamboo-shoot"" and ""iilish steamed in banana leaf"".

Dishes like dosa, idli, biryani, kebab, roti, chicken butter masala, etc. are very, very popular, and are available everywhere. Looking for obscure items here.",magenta_riddim," \> ""iilish steamed in banana leaf""

Wtf? Dude, this is one of the most popular dishes in Bengal. People can die for 'Bhapa ilish' here. Kali (Tamil) / Mudde (Kannada) / Sangatti, with dry fish curry or drumstick+Brinjal curry.   
    
Beef blood fry. Had this a very long ago at my home town.    
   
‘Nalli omelet’ made from mutton bone marrow and ‘kari dosai’, dosai with mutton toppings) of Madurai. Pork in bamboo shoot sounds Coorgi. Sprinkle some generous pepper on it while you’re at it mate.

I love the humble “Zunka bhakri thecha” from Maharashtra a lot - it may be relatively common within the state but I’d be surprised if folks outside of MH knew.

Some other such lesser known delights include “Dadpe Pohe” (again from MH), and Chicken Berry Pulao (Irani). Pompfret fry Chicken/Mutton/Lamb Ghee Roast in the Mangalore area (where it originated). Mamma mia! Ros Omelette and prawns balchao from Goa.

Squid Ghee Roast, neer dosa + chicken ros curry and pork baffat from Mangalore.

All of these dishes are popular in their own regions but quite unknown outside. Kokie 

Sindhis unite Momo -  Better if eaten in Sikkim.

Egg roll/Chicken roll/Beef roll - Calcutta street food

Tel Ilish - Ilish fish fried in the oil of the fish itself.

Chingri Chop - Pakoda made with mashed prawn.

Begun Pora - Roasted Aubergine mixed with chilli, onion, mustard oil, salt, garlic

Chaap Ruti - Fried Mutton minced meat and Rumali Roti Bheja fry? Epic channel dekh Liya kya bhai Aaj ?? Tibetan Tsampa Mutton chukka varuval. It's like a dry mutton fried with spices. It's very tasty. I recommend trying it in Anjappar if there's one in your city. Mines a Gujarati dish called “khichu” which is generally made out of rice flour. Puranpoli/holige ~ rotis stuffed with chana dal and jaggery. Paratha stuffed with minced beef Man, all of you have so much food experience. All i eat is chicken and dal rice. Saag and makki di roti. GREATEST meal of all time. Pork cooked with Mustard leaves and rajma. Pithla bhakri ani Thecha - Thecha is chopped chillies mixed with spices and other stuff. Pithla is something that is like a gelatinious dal type thingy containing besan mixed with sauteed spices. And a bhakri is a roti made of jawar or millet. Food for the soul, people. Good, good shit. Coloccasia leaf vada called patrode is absolutely amazing. Reminds me of my ex but beach kadlai. Yumm! I'm not even keralite but I love puttu and Kerala porata with some good curries. Avial... patholi - made of chana  paste Misal paav. Bhel, pani puri, Konkani fish Coconut rice with slow cooked mutton curry

Food,"In the current lockdown, I see the option to order from Swiggy. Do you guys think it is safe, or are you ordering?",15,foqsl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/foqsl9/in_the_current_lockdown_i_see_the_option_to_order/,15,"The restaurents have reduced, and there are notifs on Swiggy saying they are taking all care. But how much risk there is, according to you folks?",SiRaymando," Wash hands after handling the bag, sanitize containers before opening, you should be fine. I have ordered from the place I usually order - faced no such issue. You can ask the delivery guy to leave your food outside. That way you don't have to interact with him. To be super safe, you can throw away the container. In any case wash your hands with soap thoroughly before and after eating. Shouldn't be a problem. I have the same worry. The virus enters though eyes nose mouth, and this is food you would be eating. There is no surety that high temperature will kill the virus, and you may get infected from any aympotamic person handling your food, so I feel it is risky. These past 7 days are the longest I have gone without eating anything outside, since I stopped breastfeeding!! Throw away containers, clean hands, heat the food, eat In Mumbai, they are taking order for some 5-10 min, and are delivering. 

No issue as of now. Khud pakaa lo yaar",2020-03-25 22:02:57
