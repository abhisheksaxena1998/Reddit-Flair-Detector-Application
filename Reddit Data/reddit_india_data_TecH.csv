 LOL news of the day. I considered python to be most useful language for scientific research. in b4 'we invant' True. Just like Urdu is important for space travel. 
/s Phir shuru ho gaye bhencho. Yeh saaley thaktey nahin hein is sab chutiyappe se? Bas karo maaiyavon... Rajnath Singh, and other such idiots in the BJP, should just shut the fuck up. Winning elections doesn't give them a right to spew their ignorance on all and sundry matters. Lol. Chutya saala I doubt if he can even speak 1 word of Sanskrit  I wish I could conduct sanskrit exam all these fellas ! The single most important trait for science and technology is free flow of information. ""I see further because I stand on the shoulder of giants"".

Sanskrit will hugely disrupt this (there are hundreds of thousands of journals and preprint servers); the world is not beating down our doors to learn sanskrit to publish their theses.

Moving S&T to Sanskrit would therefore be a massively retrograde step for India.   Someone should ask this idiot: since Sanskrit is so useful to Science, Mr Singh, can you develop the necessary science to provide some scientific validation of this claim? [deleted] OMG, what a chutiya ?  I charge my mobile using ""Sanskrit'. Wish he had usefully made his speech in Sanskrit; with all reporting in Sanskrit. Then we could ignore him more. [deleted] Scientific Method most useful for science, technology, actual scientists say. 

Yes, I know he was a physics lecturer. That makes this statement all the more unfortunate. 

Sanskrit / Panani's grammar were pioneering and inspired the likes of Chomsky to advance linguistics (later used for designing programming languages) - but it's not the most important component of science.   Sanskrit is a great language, but instead of making pointless statements like this, or attending meetings advocating cow protection, Rajnath could actually try and focus on his job. As someone who initially had great hopes on this government, I am confused as to where the priorities of this government currently lie. Says the guy who has credibility on this subject ..which is an Urban Legend/hoax. This guy is the Minister for Home Affairs.. Mutherfucker write a compiler in Sanskrit. I dare you. I double dare you. How the fuck did he get a Masters in Physics without understanding what science is? wut. As long as you can get your ideas across unambiguously, what does it matter what language you use? ITT, redditors who probably cannot even speak their mother tongue properly, decide to shit on ancient language - because they cannot use that language to lay bitches. 

 Advocating the promotion of Sanskrit, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said even foreign scholars have considered it to be one of the most scientific of languages.

Respect! Sanskrit is an exceptional language as it is an artificially created language (Sam + Krita which means Completely Done or Completely Made)....While Sanskrit is undoubtedly better than most of the existing languages in many linguistic aspects it might not be that suitable for S & T, a single word in Sanskrit can have multiple meanings depending on the context of the sentence, thus making it ambiguous & unsuitable for S & T... This ambiguous nature is also one of the reasons why many S&T things remained hidden in disguise of shlokas & mantras. No it isnt'!!! Because a more precise language like German is so much more popular and used worldwide in science and technology than a less precise one like english

Science/Technology,What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,8,918ek7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,3,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ",kasam_se," why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them. You need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them. 

And thank you for having such concerns for your student - our country is the better for it due to people like you. ",2018-07-24 00:14:13

**India top-ranked country in mobile data consumption: Amitabh Kant** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Lending a testimony to Indians' romance with mobile internet
consumption,

Niti Aayog

CEO (chief executive officer)

Amitabh Kant

, on Wednesday, tweeted that India has become ""world's no 1

mobile data

consuming country."" The tweet further said that,""It's(India) mobile data
consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put
together.""

> Amazing! With 150 cr gigabytes per month of mobile data consumption India is
now world's no 1 mobile data consuming... https://t.co/PnE4ihLdxo

>

> — Amitabh Kant (@amitabhk87) 1513908042000

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

Modi government has invited anyone with experience in  in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass-media or administration and governance. 

This is the first time appointment of CIC is not based on seniority and based on merits.


DOPT  Circular - http://ccis.nic.in/WriteReadData/CircularPortal/D2/D02rti/4_7_2014_CIC-IR.pdf This is a good start. The current government has moved away from a seniority based appointment (earlier the senior most Information Commissioner was appointed the Chief) to an based appointment on application merit. Both processes have their own pros and cons.

However, there also seems be a road block. The [appointment process for a CIC](http://cic.gov.in/information_commissions.htm#19.) is done by a committee that includes the Prime Minister, one Union Cabinet Minister nominated by PM and the Leader of Opposition. We do not have a LoP as yet and any attempt to appoint one without the LoP may be viewed as a subversion of the process and therefore, unconstitutional. OR may be politically, we will soon see a LoP appointed. [**@OnlineRTI**](https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI):

I'll post the results of this survey here on /r/India in a few days.

Disclosure: I am with an NGO committed to improving the quality of STEM exposure in India.  We will use your responses to guide our future activities.  You can learn more about us through our first activity --- a science fair in Bangalore --- here [http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/](http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/)",happy_elephant," From what I hear in India, there is literally zero exposure to scientific thinking; the more options are made to rote learning and puking back content in exams, than understanding. 

Problem? funding. Most of the schools / colleges have to keep cost low and apparatus as old as 1947 are there. 

Alternative: Make math and science fun. No, computers/ laptops/phones do not count in learning - they serve as more of games or entertainment than the real thing.  Not a parent, but we need more exposure to critical and rational thinking. The amount of people that immediately believe bogus chain mails and forwards is staggering. Just think people. Frankly, I don't see too many Indian parents particularly interested in their kid's education until they reach college.  Particularly parents who are in business and wealthy.

school jata hain.  fail nahin hota hai.  haan theek hain.  baad main kyaa hogaa dekhaa jayegaa.  abhi aur kaam hain.  business hi to karega.  padhne main zyada kuch nahin hain. I wish Indian media paid more attention to quality of education in India.  To begin with, shouldn't we have rankings of high schools and colleges in India.  India Today does some work on this, but given our population and the number of schools and colleges don't we need better quality, and comprehensive rankings. >here http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/

but..isko escape velocity nahi bolna tha..you know there's special joke of this on r/India. Don't Indian kids already have an overdose of science and academics?  You should be working to expose them to more sports and arts and literature. Your website is really ordinary.

>""During the dispute over Babri Masjid, Ashis Nandy, a prominent Indian intellectual, began a series of interviews with R.S.S. members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. “Modi was a fascist in every sense,” Nandy said. “I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.”

> * Originally from India and Pakistan, Basmati became a controversial ‘issue’ after RiceTec, a Texas-based company, in 1997, patented some types of rice they developed as “American basmati”.
> * RiceTec Inc, had been trying to enter the international Basmati market with brands like “Kasmati” and “Texmati”. Ultimately, the company claimed to have developed a new strain of aromatic rice by interbreeding basmati with another variety. They sought to call the allegedly- new variety as Texmati or American Basmati.
> * RiceTec Inc, was issued the Patent number 5663484 on Basmati rice lines and grains on September 2, 1997.
> * This was objected to by two Indian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) — Centre for Food Safety, an international NGO that campaigns against biopiracy, and the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, an Indian environmental NGO who filed legal petitions in the United States. The Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research also
> objected to it.
> * They sought trade protection for basmati rice of the Indian subcontinent and jasmine rice of
> Thailand. They demanded amendment of U.S. rice standards to specify that the term “basmati” can be used only for rice grown in India and Pakistan, and jasmine for the Thai rice.
> * The Indian government, after putting together the evidence, officially challenged the patent in June 2000.

Patenting traditional indian medicines and stuff just downright lying about stuff origin, such as yoga poses is quite common in west. Recently i believe there was news of a company trying to patent pattals or leaf bowls and plates there which we use for prashad and bhandara. Every time someone tells me about why patenting is good for inventors and protects their interests which is kind of true, I remind them of all the ways it’s abused and used to bully actual pioneers who just aren’t aware of the law. Anyone who has prepared for NEET knows the story [deleted] They even tried to patent our 'Pranayama'; they got it renamed to 'Cardiac Coherence Breathing'. Ain't this old news? I've seen these Texmati  and American Basmati rice in 10 kg bags at Walmart when I went to Canada in 2007. They're quite  popular among the Indian origin population there who think it's the same as Basmati",2019-06-20 18:23:01
Science/Technology,A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,9,bwmz0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,6,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

Science/Technology,What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?,3,cj7xx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cj7xx0/what_is_the_future_of_artificial_intelligence_and/,1," 

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

&#x200B;

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Let me give you an example. I worked at motorcycle manufacturer in an Assistant Manager role in R&D. My job was to measure the dimensions of electrical components for new motorcycle models. And for that, I was paid more than 6 lakhs per year.

Science/Technology,To Redditors of Kolkata,1,bpgagr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/,0,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

In case you wonder what are these commons I so talk about, feel free to check this [6-minutes' short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pRS9167vk) or [24-minutes' long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cKrcQ30518) explanations.

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",arkoprovo1996,,2019-05-17 02:38:12

I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.
....

Will add if you guys advice something worth it.",officialshebu," Go through these things maybe it can help you. 

1. Get off social media, right now. Social media has been linked the number 1 place where one can get depressed easily, by looking at where your friends are and their success and looking at where you are. Want a hang of social media, Do redditing. Here people don't know you. Go to the subreddits that interests you. Talk your heart out.   

2. Get a hobby. Something interesting like writing, trading in market, photography, which ever takes your interest try it.   

3. Stop caring about society and don't give a shit about it. Society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong. Stop caring about what people feel abot you. Their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances.   

4. Discover a new outlook towards life. 

5. You have to survive no matter what life gives you.   


**Think of yourselves as company whose shares prices have tanked down to their all time low. Take decisions that will take the company high. Don't lose hope.**

**You Go out there and Kill it**

All the Best :)  Man! This brings back memories.

In the immediate aftermath, I felt like being the worst human being. I mean, if being nice still gets you hurt, what's the point of being nice? But for some unknown reason, I didn't go down the dark path of self-sabotage.


The first month was hard. I felt numb. I tried the Body scan technique of mindfulness (Lecture 8, TTC Mindfulness...courtesy tpb :-)

It was nice.


But my recovery started with Brexit and a feeling of schadenfreude. In hindsight, I feel it was a negative straw to latch on to. But it rejuvenated my curiosity to learn about the world i am in.


After a while, I found my appreciation for simple joys of life like pani puri, walking, ice-cream. I am not saying your grief is not real. Heck, the condition I was in, any advice would have made my self-loathing worse.


Did you watch Black Panther? It's super cool.

Science/Technology,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",46,4gbzmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,18,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

Anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.

IMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those ""guides"" are so bad it's not even funny. 

This problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching. I got into several arguments about my scores being docked because i'd solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the ""book"".  Very well written!

IMO, the good faculties are on the look out for good PhD students and good PhD students are on the look out for good faculties. Currently, it is hard to find either in India. As OP mentions,

> The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation.

From the Computer Science and Engineering perspective, there are two sides to this. In general, a student who has the capacity to do a good PhD is likely capable of working in a good corporate company. Say a good student gets a job which pays ~7lpa. If he/she stays in the industry for 5 years, this would definitely (atleast) double. One can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income. Now come to the Indian PhD student. He/she earns 3.36lpa + travel + book grants, for 5 years (it is not common to have raises for a PhD student). What follows is obvious.

Now one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money. But hell, the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future! It is not easy to find jobs in India which require PhDs and do justice to them.

Now without good students, it becomes difficult for good faculties to 'want' to stay in the country. This can, again, be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties. 

We need to take lessons from Israel. A country as big as Mizoram, has 9 universities, around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world. Even though I do not trust world rankings too much, it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best. How did they manage this? I am not sure, but I do not think nationalism has played too much of a role. It is probably due setting up the best infrastructure, inviting the best researchers, giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedom.

**tl; dr** Invite the best researchers, give them sufficient compensation, academic freedom. Students and quality of research will follow. Can we also use the argument in OP's post to explain how so little engineering is actually done in india and how many of the ""engineering"" firms are just glorified contractors? http://408perceptions.blogspot.com/2016/08/engineering-in-inida-is-waste-of-time.html whatch this article

Now I did some digging and found out there seems to be pattern amongst all of the recent appointments.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

EDIT: WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated. C'mon yaar, it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info, I would request you not to downvote it. Please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate.
",Responsbile_Indian," Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year? I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. 

ISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.

To develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.

There are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.

 [deleted] > Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?  

Because they have failed at their primary goals? Negligible research output, unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action. A bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt. 

FTII on the other hand deserved better than Sri Gajendra. 
 >WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated

Party before Country . Right-wingers definition of nationalism . kids have come to power after 60 years :) . Don't worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  FTII, and Indian film making in general, is as shitty as it can get.

People say Gajendra Chouhan is not qualified to be FTII chief. I say FTII is so shitty, even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it. The one condition is that he/she should not come from FTII, or Indian mainstream film-making, which is just pure horseshit. 
  how is FTII and institution of national importance?

Second question, why should government be in the business of running FTII. >But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?

You have **one** data point for this.  OP, just one correction. BJP is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum. If anything they would be considered left of centre. Economically, not much separates the BJP and tbh most other parties. Between the Congress and BJP? It is just that the BJP has better execution of projects and lesser vote bank politics. Youth congress making a mountain out of a molehill. Just riling up students for no rhyme or reason. Did UPA not make appointments for these posts? Did EVERY government not make appointments? This is just a front.

Arjun and his friend Harish are funny guys and they have an [entertaining youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/mindryin?feature=results_main). You should check the channel out. 

I think this [post from Arjun's blog](http://middleclassbrahmin.blogspot.com/2008/05/anthem-for-ages.html) that mocks [this ridiculous kannada song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM8tyb_plXg) is one of the funniest things I've read in a blog.

Science/Technology,An Exposition and Solution to the NGO problem,1,28fy7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28fy7b/an_exposition_and_solution_to_the_ngo_problem/,1,"**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",nerds_revenge," Remaining essay: 


This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it.",2014-06-18 15:37:31

Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Edit. Join /r/atheismindia for more discussion on leaving your faith and coming back to the real world.

Dear r/all please do take the time to know about the recent religious riots happening in the Capital city delhi /r/India",pking3," I don't think ""atheist"" or ""none"" is an option under the official column of religions in India. So if you are born in a Muslim family you'll forever be a Muslim, unless you convert to some other religion. There are officially no ""atheists"" in India. We need to change this and develop the atheist culture in India. Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?
Then He is not omnipotent.

Is He able, but not willing?
Then He is malevolent.

Is He both able and willing?
Then whence cometh evil?

Is He neither able nor willing?
Then why call Him God?

#Pure Comedy
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*~Father John Misty*  

The comedy of man starts like this  
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips  
And so Nature, she divines this alternative  
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever  greets us on the other end  
Is kind enough to fill us in  
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever   since  

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to   address  
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron     deficient  
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look    after the kids    
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this   thing its milk?  
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we   can switch  
It's hard not to fall in love with something so   helpless  
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this  

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy  
Just waiting until the part where they start to   believe  
They're at the center of everything  
And some all powerful being endowed this horror   show with meaning  

Oh, their religions are the best  
They worship themselves yet they're totally   obsessed  
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks,   these unbelievable outfits  
And they get terribly upset  
When you question their sacred texts  
Written by woman-hating epileptics  
 
Their languages just serve to confuse them  
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure  
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring  
And hand out prizes when someone patents the   cure  
Where did they find these goons they elected to   rule them?  
What makes these clowns they idolise so   remarkable?  
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new   gods   
So they can go on being godless animals  

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but   to believe  
Their horizons that just forever recede  
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a   prison of beliefs  
That they never ever have to leave  

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman   would conceive!  
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive   is the struggle to survive  
But the only thing that they request is something   to numb the pain with  
Until there's nothing human left  
Just random matter suspended in the dark  
I hate to say it, but each other's all we got Religion is the main cause of unrest in India. Religion is one intense fandom. [deleted] Religion is legalised madness

Edit: Thank you for the shining silver kind stranger. To all those parents and students who called Moral Science classes a sham, this is why we needed it. Religion is an expired product that has continued to stay. It should have been eradicated or died a while back but has not. If we as species have to reach next level then we need to get over religion. Any existing religion is like Superman, did wonders on paper but doesn't actually exists. “When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”

― Jiddu Krishnamurti


Questioner :  Kindly give a straight reply. Does god exist, or not? Yes, or no? If yes, how best to realize him in this life?

JK : ""If you examine very closely, you have created god. Right? In India there are about – I was told there are about 300,000 gods and more. (Laughs) You understand? Every local person has his own god.

So, sirs, we have created god. See the irony of it. Thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created. Which is, to worship oneself and call it god. You understand all this? – the better part of you is god. Right? I wonder if you understand this. First of all, let’s be clear. Have you created god? The local gods round the corner, or the local god in Rome, or in Tirupati, or wherever, you have created them, haven’t you? You are so very uncertain, aren’t you, so frightened. If you say we have created, then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that. Out of your fear you want security. Right? You want safety, you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid. You follow? So you create that, and then worship that. Just see what you are doing! Going to Tirupati and putting all your money in the bag – do you think gods want your money? Sir, look at it all. You have nothing to offer but money, garlands, prostrations, rituals. Right? You have nothing else to offer. Have you realised the tragedy of this, sirs?

If you love – not god, that’s very easy to love god because it is an abstraction, it has not much meaning. But if you love, that very love is god, that very love is sacred. You won’t go outside to look for god. You understand all this, sirs!

And the questioner wants to know if I believe in god. I don’t. Because god is something created by man. There is such a thing as eternity, which is to be outside of time. Right, sir? For that you must have a mind, a heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life. Right? From your vanity, your arrogance, your selfishness – you follow, sir? And we say, we are not capable of it, tell us what to do. You are back in the cycle, somebody to tell you what to do. Sir, you are in a jungle, you have to walk through it by yourself. Right? And for that you need vitality and vigour and strength. Not belief in god, in goodness – belief has no place where truth is concerned. Right?"" This post is pure gold!
Religion destroys humanity not build it. All cast system, racism, homophobia and misogynims have their roots in religion.
Just fuck religion and you'll bring out the best in humans!!

God is like that 'Baba' we use to scare kids with so they won't do anything that is denied. If you need divine  reward to do something good or you have fear if you do something bad something bad will happen I think your are a piece of shit. Just be kind to the people help them if you can and for the world sake stop protecting your religion. \*reads title\* : Ahhh , I see you are a man of culture as well It's really my imaginary friend is so much better than yours. We're not going to get blown out in a supernova, the sun's too little. Religion is a massive waste of time. It has outlived it's utility. This is why i believe in my made up God-

Dovah- A dragon from Skyrim I personally believe that religion is for those weak minded people who can't face the music and always need some kind of support (was one of them). There was this really nice quote from MIB- ""An individual is a smart person. Perfectly capable of making his own decisions, rational etc. but crowd on the other hand is violent, easy to provoke, and has nothing but a common herd mentality."" Now don't get me wrong. I do read sometime bits and pieces of religious text which are some really well thought out philosophical texts but let us be real. There always be a motherfucker who's gonna distort everything and use gullible people to support his own propaganda by exploiting their concept of belief. 

So preach father and preach it hard. Fucking hell fuck all religions. All they have ever done is divided us, and taken advantage of by opportunistic old politicians. And our childish adults should take as much blame for that. We’re literally standing on the verge of global environmental collapse with highest levels of inequality and unemployment with a massively flawed education system and all they can talk about is their mandirs and masjids with no regard for what the future generations would go through. This. This right here!! Fuckkk all religion!!!! The bane of mankind Not just religion, any ideology that overtakes your identity as a human being is dangerous.



Be it the religious wars that were fought, to the dictators who mass murdered people in keeping to their beliefs, everywhere people collectively stood behind an ideology that shadowed their human identity.



Don't believe in ideologies rather believe and hope that tomorrow when a mob of these a$$f##king c@@ts come to lynch you, there'll be atleast one amongst them questioning what he's doing and changes his mind about his beliefs.



Or if you are privileged enough, you could just live in harmony, clapping and cheering, watching while these c@@ts kill themselves. /S Remove religion from schools (prayers) and we have a chance at better future I am going through same frustration bro , where are the so called foking almighty God who are immortal , or are they the ones doing this, them fok them . 
 
Guys tell me one benefit in believing in religion ? Does it save u from these riots ? Which is happening in the name of it .
Does it make people disciplined? Then who are these goons who are Killing in the name of religion ? 

I guess it was just an fiction story written by a man , and later after centuries people started thinking it as thier past and that it was all real . Just imagine after centuries if somehow someone reads marvel comics or harry potter or any such fiction story and actually believe in them thinking it as real thing from past. 

 I wish people one day no longer believes in it . Man made god,not the other way around. [Religion is like a Penis](https://i.imgur.com/V4gTSiO.jpg) We can't ban religions but we should start banning religion backed schools / madarshas Fuck god. I’m better without it. All we are to them are just Paying FANBOYS of their poorly written ""SciFi franchise""...
  -Mr.R0bot(about religion) Wanted to gift an award, but i m poor ☹️. Very well written. I have the same ideology. Hope so people stop this mass brutality in the name of religion. It wouldn't have been a real problem if everyone minded their own bussiness. ""Nothing divides us except religion"" Are you sure about that..? 🤔 Religion is a way for humans to escape reality. It makes people feel as if they are part of something bigger. In reality they are nothing, and they cant accept that. Its way too easy to think they are part of god's plan rather than a blob of hydrocarbons.

Religion is just a theory that was believed for so long that when better theories which proved religion false came along people couldnt accept it. Wrong sub my man. Most in this sub are sensible enough to know this. Should probably post it somewhere where people are deluded. People who are using incendiary rhetoric and inciting violence to meet their agenda are not in this sub. The intricate reality of these cults are far more complex to find a universal solution(for now) than saying ""fuck all religion"" on the internet. Religions will fade away,it will take time though. Until then, it's what it is. If it wasn't for religion, it would be caste or nationalism....for some reason being a human isnt enough and we feel a need to form smaller communities      
Haven't come up with what a possible solution looks like but at the least it should include critical thinking in kids and stopping religious indoctrination There is no better way to make people who have no beef in the first place hate each other to the point of committing genocide than through religion. Religion, is just a flawed philosophy. There's is nothing special in it. Religion is a mental illness. Why on earth would want to associate with them? Blech. Let them kill each other and some day they’ll all be gone. https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190801-tomorrows-gods-what-is-the-future-of-religion

 Rest of the world fighting with coronavirus. Religion is the opium of the masses. Forget about the bloody Gods and listen to what I am telling you - Margery Tyrell A hallucinatic person said something about religion which made so much sense to me. 

""If I don't believe in my imagenary friend, why the hell should I believe in yours?"" ~ Elliot Anderson Good rant I could not agree more - my hats off to my Indian brothers and sisters in the struggle against the zealots Keep spreading the truth.  Let's turn all religions into mythology again. religion was invented by smart rulers to control dumb people, and its something that's sadly never going to change. when you teach a child something, the older they get the harder it is for you to change their mind, and when they have kids of their own they teach them the same thing and it becomes an amplification loop. we live in a world where people take incredible luxuries for granted because thats what we're born with. the modern world allows dumb people to be loud and grab the attention of other dumb people who think the same, something that was never possible before. for god's sake just look at all the anti science movements, you can calculate the speed of light using a microwave and a chocolate bar but if they don't believe it it doesn't exist. people who think this way dont want to know the truth, they want what they think is the truth to be the truth and when that line of thinking combines with conflicting opinions all hell breaks loose. Careful not to cut yourself on all that edge. Disclaimer first: I am 100% an atheist.

Having said that, the problem isn't religion in and of itself.

Most religious teachings usually boil down to 'care about others' and 'be a decent person'. Yes, there's a lot of fucked up stuff in the texts as well, not denying that. But a lot of people find comfort and strength in their beliefs, and you saying they should just let go of it because it's illogical and dumb, is frankly as intolerant as religious fanatics. Religion also does not have to be at odds with science and learning. I remember asking a religion teacher in school which is correct: The Big Bang or God made the world. She told me 'Both. The Big Bang happened, but God made it happen (obvs not something I believe, but not the point is) She also reiterated that the Bible is not literal. And she was a nun. And, as you may have heard, Einstein believed in God too. So, again, it's possible for both religion and scientific knowledge to coexist.

Organised religion is absolutely a problem. In my transition from Roman Catholic to atheist, I had a 'I believe in God, but not in the Church' phase. Religious organisations can be corrupt to the core. People twisting scriptures and teachings to suit their own agendas of hate and power are a problem. People using religion to support ignorance and prejudice that harms others (like being against the LGBTQ community, or anti vaxxers, or sects who believe medical intervention should not be allowed) are a problem. But religious people who use religion to find personal comfort, help others, and be part of a community? There is nothing wrong with that.

Yes, I still believe the world would be better off without religion, because of all of the people who exploit it and do so much harm in its name. But it is not my, or your, or anyone's place to dictate to someone what they should or should not believe in if they are not harming you in any way and just living their life peacefully. Because, again, if you do this, it makes you no better than religious nuts who want to dictate how we live our lives. Amen Stop talking sense. true fuck religion Thank god I'm an atheist. Yes, all religions are fairy tales. Yes, no religion has any definitive proof of being true.

But there is one point people here are missing. Religion does give people mental peace and a purpose to live especially when things are not going their way. While it gives people a false sense of hope that makes them believe that things will get better, it does keep them resilient during tough times. People want easy answers to questions and religion gives it to them. We may be rational in thinking that we can embrace tough times by just moving forward and waiting for things to become better but others are not. They can easily get depressed and go through mental problems.

People who derive pride from their religion go too far. To solve that they need to be educated and given fulfilling work. This won't stop them from being religious but it will at least give them a genuine reason to be proud.

If you want to do away with religion you need to first solve mental health problems.

Just my 2 cents. Exactly. And fuck nationalism. None of us chose these lives/bodies that we are living in. Neither did the person you hate, choose this life for himself

Borders were created by us and it’s something very abstract. Fighting and killing others for something like this seems very stupid to me.

Then I would like to measure several parameters gdp, income, freedom of speech, etc. 

I am really curious what the results will be. It's always been a way to control people. It can be argued that it brought many people together in the good ol' days. The world wasn't so much connected back then. Your entire life would be spent in a 10km radius where it would be rare to find someone who believes in a different imaginary being. So it brought everyone together by believing things larger than themselves.

But the in last century, since everyone is so connected, finding a person who believes in some other imaginary being is too easy. And that's where the human group psychology acts against us and forms groups. It becomes Us vs Them. Religion is unnecessary in our society. But I don't think it should be irradiated or banned.

I think the ideal way to deal with this would be to just keep what metaphysical thing you believe in to yourself. Yes This is why THANOS was right! Wait till you hear about capitalism classism Imagine being an adult who holds faith in their omnipotent imaginary friend as described in a thrice-translated collection of oral histories collected over 1500 years ago, regarding events that happened hundreds of years before they were written down.

You know, the Inuit believe that the earth was created by Raven. The difference: I know ravens exist. Post this on a chintu sub and witness the dislikes Yesss fuck them. Fuck all of them. Every fucking government form I've ever filled asks for my religion. Be it university or a public sector job. I despise the idea that my belief system is somehow relevant to my performance as a student or as an employee. I make it a point to write ""n/a"" in that section, no matter what the repercussions. 

Iirc once a public college even asked my caste. Ffs my caste, and no, not from reservation point of view, just under personal information. Religion is nothing but a tool to control a large number of people by the people in power or those who pretend to be the representative of the religion.
It was used by hitler to justify the heinous crime even tho no sane mind would agree this level of torture for a fellow human.it was used by evangelist Christian Europeans who plundered lands of other n descredited their culture along with subjecting them to discrimination.It was used by isis fighter who were so islamic that they made burkha mandatory for all woman in their area n came with motto to defend islam but themselves raped in every village they went n even killing fellow muslims.it is now being used by the  rss n bjp to polarise the people n antagonize the whole muslim community on pretext of ages old of their own made up history n encouraging lynchings through bajrang dals ,inciting violence.it is still being used by few godmen who even with rape charges against them n property worth of 100s of crore people support them blindly n anybody even dare to criticize them is declared the enemy of the whole community. I feel you man, Im gonna start college this year and am really afraid to go to Delhi to study, all it would take is one person to accuse someone of being a Hindu or a Muslim for a bloodbath that to start that police will probably ignore I truly believe in the not too distant future that the belief of religion will be classified as a mental illness. It’s CRAZY to me that when you go back and read some of the different religious texts it’s chock full of holes and usually rely on “prophets” speaking/ having visions of *insert deity here* to get the message across. That shit sounds like textbook schizophrenia but because no one knew what that was they just accepted it as truth. Now here we are thousands of years later, millions killed in the name of religion and people STILL BELIEVE THIS BULLSHIT. *sorts by controversial,* *grabs popcorn* A fellow atheist popping in,

As I've said before, if God does exist, he doesnt deserve our worship because of the unnecessary suffering this donkey allows in his name or without. God, either shape up and help, or fuck the right off. Religion is like having a dick. It's fine to have one, but it's NOT ok to shove into other people especially children. I'm agnostic, and dislike all religions, but this reads like it belongs to r/iamverysmart. Or r/iam14andthisisdeep Let's get this straight, there are a lot of things that divide us other than religion. It is in our nature to do it. 

Religion is not bad. It's believing that your religion is better than all the others, or your god is superior to the other gods is what is the problem. I am not religious and I agree with you on most points. I want to believe that the abolishment of all religions is the answer to most of the problems of humanity. But, here is a thought. What about the countries with the most non-religious people? China, Czech, UK... Can we really say they are perfect? China has 90% of people who are non-believers. Can we really say they are in a better state than us?

Religion is a problem. But maybe the bigger problem is basic human nature which is to be selfish and divisive. Yes buddy the problem is religion. Not corruption, theft, incompetence, maladministration, colonial laws, red tape, power cuts, absence of health care, undrinkable water, no water, rabies, typhoid, malaria, dengue, PM10, unlivable cities, unsustainable cost of living, ridiculous salaries, sewage in the water, inability of the state and judicial system to catch or punish any kind of criminal at any level, all of which lead to the majority of people living in a permanent state of despair. No, the only problem is religion. Let's get rid of that and everything will be perfect. Great solution. Of course you are right. Nice work. Now go cure cancer b***d. If God does exist, he is having a laughing riot now. 

And yeah, fuck religion. Bruh so edgy, wow. Fuck Christian
Christian: Well, Hello. “If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time **we got rid of Him.**” -- james baldwin. ""Faith in God is the purposeful *suspension* of critical thinking"" - Bill Maher Also... Fuck Moash I do not believe in any god whatsoever,but I do believe that if people want to,they should.
If something provides them with an anchor,a sense of relief,then why force them out of it?
But of course,I 100% agree with your point of mass killings due to religion,and I'd also like to add to it that the concept of religion has been a major hindrance in our development as well.
All in all I'm just saying if people want to practice religion,they should,but,they should be accepting of other religions and learn to live in peace. I do not believe in this modern world commercial religion shit and have distanced myself from religion since 15 years now.
The thing is, it doesn't matter in India.
I used to live in Gurgaon, and was asked my name numerous times (even in front of my house) by random people who then started fighting(non verbal fights) with me just because its a persian name. 
I live in Toronto now, and noone gives a shit about your religion here (unless you decide to live in Indian/pakistani/bangladeshi ghettos again).
The thing is, it doesn't matter what your faith or philosophy is, when the crowd of fanatics comes at your door, they will kill you. There is no reason with these people, and to be honest its more related to the wealth gap between rich and poor. The poor have rage in them, they have cell phones with cheap internet and big families with nothing to do, so in their mind, power is in numbers and force is only way to get things done.
Seriously fuck this society.
Edit:word Lol looks like somebody just figured it out No matter how peaceful your religion is, the world will never be in peace with religion in it. Religion is the most dangerous disease, weapon and mental illness in this world. The main cause behind most wars, look at world war II, Nazis were predominantly Christians.... Hated Jews for killing their Lord... Thank you for this post. r/redditmoment My opinion on religion?
It was created to control the people. While watching the Hindu nationalists go insane in India this is all I can think about. We have to kill religion. Pakistani here.

We really are in shock over what has started happening.
We send our thoughts and prayers for all of you.

I'm already an athiest who promotes humanity more than anything. 
All religions tell you to do better to gods or entities creation first. This is just ungodly and non human violence.

I hope this ends soon. I hope people get out safe One day religion will die off and humanity will be free from its lies. Religion is the biggest con ever Finally someone who makes sense. I also agree that the religion and the caste system is absolute bullshit Here is the really amazing speech from Mr.Robot questioning religion.


""Is that what God does? He helps? Tell me, why didn't God help my innocent friend who died for no reason while the guilty ran free? 

Okay. Fine. Forget the one offs. How about the countless wars declared in his name? 

Okay. Fine. Let's skip the random, meaningless murder for a second, shall we? How about the racist, sexist, phobia soup we've all been drowning in because of him?

And I'm not just talking about Jesus. I'm talking about all organized religion. Exclusive groups created to manage control. A dealer getting people hooked on the drug of hope. His followers, nothing but addicts who want their hit of bullshit to keep their dopamine of ignorance. 

Addicts. Afraid to believe the truth. That there's no order. There's no power. That all religions are just metastasizing mind worms, meant to divide us so it's easier to rule us by the charlatans that wanna run us. All we are to them are paying fanboys of their poorly-written sci-fi franchise. If I don't listen to my imaginary friend, why the fuck should I listen to yours? People think their worship's some key to happiness. That's just how he owns you. Even I'm not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality. So fuck God. He's not a good enough scapegoat for me.""

- Elliot Alderson (Mr.Robot Season 2 Episode 3) I agree.

My parents(Hindus) always said that I must pray to God every day and shit like that but honestly, I didn't think there was any sense in that. Even in my school assemblies when everyone would vow their heads in prayer(I went to a Christian school) I would just stand there with my head up. I never felt that there was any use of prayer. Amen I'm 17 y/o and I am sure I can live without your fairytale. Call it bragging but I'm just gonna go ahead and consider myself much better than majority of adult population. I am also a vegan. I have questioned my life far and wide and I think everyone should go through the process of self evaluation. 
Please do it. Do it for us. The future generations. this entire thread is a huge r/redditmoment lmao Religion makes many people look at eachother as sub humans. We dont matter in the grand scheme of things but it is worth it to be good to eachother to protect the little we have. Religion causes so much pain and harm to innocent families. I don't hate religious people at all. I understand WHY some people believe but its just a fact the world would be a better place without it. Even Satanists? 

https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/tenets Atheists are just people who admit we don't know how the universe works but we believe scientists  are closer to the answers to the universe than the priests are. I've never understood the mental gymnastics some of you religious apes use to justify your beliefs. I have highly educated intelligent family members who believe in all the fucking cultural pseudoscience. 

Atheism isn't a choice, it's a symptom of a functioning brain. Amazing. Tell others to be open minded. Then ask them to live exactly the way you want them too. 



Fuck you too Valid points. But my religion has helped me become a better person, treat others with respect regardless of their religion and the colour of their skin, give charity, be a productive member of the society and most of all it gives me hope.

The problem is not religion, its extremism. Religious people are literally patients of a brainwashing cult that has incepted 'anti-human' idea and tradition in their brain All right it's time to address the usual rebuttals.

""We need Religion for emotional and spiritual values""

You can hire a therapist for emotional support and simply buy a good telescope to look at the night sky, nothing is more spiritual than gazing at a clear night sky.

""In 20th century more people died by Nazis and commies who were atheists""

Nazis were not atheists, they were Christians who traditionally hated Jews (even the Protestants hate Jews, just look into Martin Luther's verses). Communists were atheists but weren't just entirely atheists. Its the classic saying, a communist can be an atheist but not all atheists are communist (especially proletarian dictatorship).

""You cannot ignore the good things that religious people do.""

You can do good things without being religious, there's this thing called humanity you know. 

""Being an atheist doesn't mean you're a good person""

Precisely the point, atheism is simply an absence of belief in a God and doesn't explain anything about a person's political or social inclinations. There were and are many bad atheists but unlike theist folks an atheist doesn't need to defend that evil person merely because they share that one specific philosophy.

""You cannot just remove religion like it does nothing""

That's true, religion does offer many good things. But as I said earlier, you can offer all those good things without invoking an omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient God.

""Atheists are just too arrogant""

Theists claim to know the mind of the omnipotent being which created this entire universe and yet atheists are the arrogant ones... Right.

""Religion and atheism are incompatible""

Not entirely true, it depends on one's definition of religion. If a religion doesn't need a God as a criterion then technically you can be an atheist and be part of a religion. Again atheism only means the absence of belief in a God, nothing more nothing less. Amen I think we're stuck between a fake left wing that just wants to appease minorities and a rightwing that wants to install a tyranny of the majority. When the constitution clearly wants us to put aside the religious differences and want common good for everyone, I don't think, we, people are not ready yet to think in such higher terms. After all these years since we said our good byes to British, we only inherited the golden divide and rule policy to keep people invested in their religious sentiments and derive political and economic returns from them. I don't see a near future where people can see through shit and have a true democracy. It's sad, but it's also a painful truth. Chinese are atheists and look at their treatment of Uighurs, Tibetans, Hongkong, Taiwan etc... Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people by marx Well you know what they say: religion is the opium of the masses. I personally vibe the concept of faith and I can definitely see why people would be drawn to a belief, be it imaginary or not to sustain thoughts of afterlife and a greater existence. However, I hate the concept of religion as an institution. Religion has become an institution to control and generate profits and set its own agenda. Its an archaic institution that isn’t needed in the 21st century ʻOumuamua, take me away from this planet You should check out anti-theism. Btw totally agreeing with every single letter. I couldn't say it any better then this. Fuck Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and their other spin offs. YES PLEASE If you don't want to accept death, that's fine. Focus your efforts on achieving immortality. Decide that you will live forever or die trying.

But don't be dumb enough to believe in something that doesn't translate whatsoever to reality. Most people on here would already be atheists so there's no point preaching but just want to say that the world has far more to offer than religion will have you belief and this isn't some short trip in a grand journey. This *is* the grand journey. Do good without thinking of consequences and without shedding blood for any divine powers.

 If there are just gods then they would be pleased with you.

 If there are no gods then you have made the world a little better nonetheless. 

If your gods are displeased because you didn't worship and slaughter for them, then they are petty and cruel and not worthy of being called gods anyway. I can't explain how similar I feel with your thoughts Amen to that Yea exactly I think India should have a religion or no religion column 
Join r/atheismindia Wow i have always been a closeted agnostic. Didn't think there were many people in india with the same mindset. On seeing the reaction and comments here i am relieved. Hey look, an atheist on reddit! Up next, a bigot from BJP! So true
Take my fucking upvote. You only realized this now. Religion is the best tools for power mongers and you know it's another use, yeah you guessed it right, fool the foolish flock. That's the irony of religion   
Long long ago people settled in groups, made their own cultures, lifestyles and called it as religion to bring them closer.   
Now, the same religion is being used to make people apart!   
Sad part is, many can't see it. Religion is the opiate of the masses - Aristotle  maybe Religion is just some really good fiction with a very toxic fanbase I hear you. Also eloquently expressed by [Carl Sagan in The Pale Blue Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g) Finally the post I was waiting for..
Looks like people are starting to realize the true evil are the religion. I am getting out of these things lately. Religion at best are just fandoms and should not be given any importance in real life situations. Fuck all Humans, worst beings on earth! I have to say I like the singing and the dancing, from whatever religion, but for the rest I completely agree. Religion imo is nothing but a **MASS CONTROL**. People do not fucking respect religion, we are fucking scared from it. Human itself is the scourge of humanity. I have seen the good and bad things religions can do to people. So I see your point but not necessarily. Couldn't agree with you more! Im not that religious anyways, and you seem to have a good point. Religion is the main cause of unrest here, and if people don’t pay so much attention to it, the unrest might stop. Human...is above all religion...Lets practice humanity & co-exist in harmony & make the world  a better place I see, you are a man of ~~culture~~ intelligence as well.

Edit: I've had my share of  participation in atheist groups on the net. Sadly most of them are filled with people who don't know the difference between atheism and agnosticism. r/atheism Religion were made to bring people together in harmony, to share each other's thoughts, to help others out in need of help, but lately due to sheer greed of basic human nature. Religion has become a tool to control the masses and incite hate and violence against others who don't follow same ideology. nice post thanks for sharing George Carlin always had it right - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE) Everyday I'm constantly reminded that 'prayers' are the single most useless invention of humankind. There is only one god : Time I see that you're a man of logic OP. Just joined, happy to see more people with common sense :3 The only thing religion does anymore is give us more artificial reasons to divide ourselves into tribes and hate each other. Couldn't agree more. Amen to that [Relevant Mr robot monologue](https://youtu.be/NCe8NUK4BjQ) Death to all fanatics! ""Hey if you read history, God is one of the leading causes of death, has been for thousands of years"" - George Carlin I hate it more than you all do. Lol. Cheers Fuck Atheism! How do you feel now? This is exactly how people with religious belief feel after reading this. [I am a athiest myself] Dude just the first 2 sentences were enough I'm Hindu. I chill with my gods and I am with you a 100%. It's not about being from a certain religion. It's about an individual's willingness to not take himself so fucking seriously, sit down, and contemplate his mad life. Who else have watched Man from the Earth.. Religion is how you can trick people into giving you their life.  Religion is the tool used to exploit the masses.  ""Don't worry, this life is just a test run.  Actually, the more you suffer in this life, the more god loves you- the more he can hook it up in the next life.""  Now give me tax free money, please.  Bonus points if you slay some infidel. I have pretty strong feelings about orgasm. Maybe thats what life is about - perpetual orgasm. Religion used to bring people together back in the ancient times to a common mindset so that they can be together, trust each other and work and discover & invent new things and develop various technologies. It used to unite people for greater things. But nowadays the amount of toxicity and hate spreading through religion is immense. Religion is dividing people than brigining them together.
Kinda ironic to its original purpose. What about Dudeism? Didn't know there's a sub for Indian atheists lol. I'm a fan of Indian atheists fb page. They call out all relegion equally, but ppl also get triggered when they oppose NRC and CAB, it amazes brahmin Bhakths don't understand they are standing up agsint discrimination not standing up for a relegion
.

Also why is that our mythology of gods only ever mention animals that exists today? Why isn't there a god with Dino as his vehicle? Coz they didn't dig deep enough to find one and ppl who made yo these back then didn't even know about pre historic animals. Think to yourself........... ""When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a Religion.""

Robert M. Pirsig I love u Yeah FUCK all religions. People dying over made-up stuff: Very Clever But what currently happening in India is Fascism using Religion masks to divide people.




Yup. The good ol' 'Divide and Conquer'. ""Doubt is the highest form of intelligence"" Religion should have no place in politics All religions are man-made and man is the effigy of mistakes. 

&#x200B;

Hit ^(Up-vote) if you agree the statement! Here here! Thank ""**GOD**"" someone stepped up and spoken the truth, the truth which matters the most in today's modern world.

You deserve every upvote on this post. As Geroge Carlin said the best and I quote - ""Idiots fighting trying to prove to eachother, whose imaginary friend has a bigger dick"". I’m not sure if atheism is the only way. It is a good way to focus on the grand scheme of things, but religion isn’t inherently wrong. I believe it changes are a result of technological advancement. While abandoning religion would work, ‘rebooting’ a religion could also work. I only say this because religions actually never invoke any violence. It’s the understanding of the people who practice it. Granted both are equally hard, but consider a religion such as the religious society of friends. They are a good example of how well religion can affect a society. If we educated people, and had them either further educate or cut ties with people who have immoral concepts, things would improve as well. Not shitting on your opinion. Just giving my two cents. I'll just give my 2 paise:

Religion is a meme. No, not in an Advice Animal kind of way, but if you go by the original meaning of a meme, it is an idea that compels people to propagate it. In this a meme behaves like an organism such as a virus. Thus, religion is a meme.

Another point to support this is that **religion does not exist without people**. Religion NEEDS people to survive, without people religion cannot exist. Therefore, people are more important than religion because people came first. Religion wholly exists in the minds of people, it is not a tangible thing.

1 paisa more: Religion does not only mean belief in some god, IMO even Nationalism and Patriotism can be religions in their own right. Although I agree, heres a clip of [Joe Rogan talking to Physicist Brian Greene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpStPNAB7Cw) on the actual purpose of Religion. Very interesting take and I agree with him too. But most people take their religions very literally. Would you like to join the church of shrek? ""In this world, good people will do good things and bad people will do bad things, but for a good man to do bad things, it takes religion."" I became an athiest due to a few reason but mainly because of eiliot's talk on religion which stuck with me for years, I introspected on it never found a contradiction so I quit believing in my religion. There are a lot more reasons but still.



One of the lines he said was

""Religion is nothing but a poorly written sci-fi franchise that we are huge fan boys of""


""Why are wars fought in his name if peace is what he desires""


The best one

""God is a drug and we are the addicts."" Amen I read a book by Jack Donovan, The Way of Men.

In the book he said that it's man's primal desire to belong to a group, to be a part of something greater than himself.

The teens, and young adults that you see rioting on the streets are fulfilling their desire to belong to something, to fight for something, to stand shoulder to shoulder with fellow men. Everything else is a superficial excuse to act on that instinct.

When you have a large population of uneducated people devoid of critical thinking abilities, they are pretty much zombies acting on instinct and very shallow reasoning, which is evident when you hear those arsonists talk. These people are the pawns, unknowning and unpaid mercenaries of anyone smart enough to rally them. The universe is 13.7 billion years old, the earth only 4.4 billion. What was god doing during those 9 billion years. Also, when we finally get to Mars and other star systems maybe in the future, how will we get to heaven? Where is heaven? Can we go faster than the speed of light going from the other star system to go back to earth and go into heaven of hell? God is fake and made up, evolution is real  and we will all die. Eventually our planet will be unbearable for human life as we know it. Amen to this PREACH!! Op: Babe, can we smash?
OP’s gf: No, I’m waiting til marriage
Op: “Fuck all religion. It’s bullshit” You have successfully summarised the trimmings of your education, and preserved this moment in time. I’m excited for you, not many people get to develop further and then be able to point back to the moment they were so very wrong. I appreciate the effort though, as I used to believe what you have written, so it’s a clear view onto my past self. Well articulated! If I may throw you a crumb of comfort, life would be boring if we had all the answers, so in the future when you read these words again, you may wonder, as I do now, the vast learning opportunities that remain. Is this by any chance in context to the current political situation in India.

Because if it is then it would seem like a very irresponsible thing to project onto social media. Like an ""all lives matter"" kind of argument.

e.g. Saying the same thing in a country where atheists are being prosecuted or where people stigmatized atheists is a noble and brave thing but saying the same thing in China would mean siding with thier current regimes inhumane persecution and rounding of of Muslims in concentration camps)
Not to mention feeding into thier weird obsession with Tibet and who the next Dalai lama should be.

Imagine a Pakistani saying fuck Hinduism and fuck Islam while a hindu village is burned by mullah led mobs. Blaming the oppressor doesn't have to mean you blame the victim as well, and as much as you probably don't mean it that way, in the current context it **seems** a lot like that.

PS: if you're going to bring in the fact that it's not just Hindus attacking Muslims but the opposite as well, I'd want to invite you to remember it's starts in the broader context of the CAA-NRC under which it's fairly obvious who's going to be suffering. r/atheism So I have to ask what's happening in India that got this guy so riled up against religion? Glad that you've out grown religion 👍 This post is GOLD! I totally agree with you All religions are fantasy like Harry Potter but let’s be honest, not all religions are the same, some are worse than others when it comes to coexisting.  
Some Christians and Muslims believe every word in their fantasy book and are influenced by it to hate those who aren’t like them or are homosexuals. Have you ever tried to read and interpret what's written in any religious text like the Gita? AMEN BROTHER Yes, complete agreement.  I call this anti-theism, not atheism. Religion is a tool people use to deal with living it isn’t just about death. Unfortunately we’re not pure logical being. A lot of people with emotions will turn to higher powers in any form. Sadly this message will never reach to the people who need to see this. Among them most will simply reject it. ""Religion is the husk of faith"" -Tao Te Ching Lets all realize that the universe doesn't care because it cannot.  Take action based on our species and this shared planet to protect ourselves by cherishing all life around us.  Resist the animal nature or mammalian ways.  Do not overpopulate the planet assuming only humans are important.  Do not pollute and exploit based solely on your very short life span but instead think of long term life.  We are evolution and each choice brings about rewards or failures for our species.  Lets choose to share with all life and allow room because from what we can observe there is no global, universe consciousness that cares. The amount of scientific evidence for religion and flat earth theory is exactly the same. As a society, we just accept the former because it's been around for so long and is ""tradition"". You forgot 30000-15000 years ago we became best freinds with wolves and they have had our backs since . They have shed more blood for us than you could imagine. Fighting off animals to protect our children and crops and domestic animals. I hate how people thank god when it was dog by our side fighting and dying with us. Damn, you went rough. Before religion there were tribes and races. People always loved to form groups for recognition and unity.Thats just the nature of us humans, removing religion will not stop violence although admitting it is very easy weapon, something else will take its place. What needs to be removed is hate and instate understanding our differences and accepting each other. Religion is to humans is what Modi is to India! I agree lol Too bad Modi doesnt feel the same way. Tbh religion fills in the gaps that makes other feel unimportant as they do not matter to the universe. You can follow a religion and my opinion of you wouldn't go any lower and rather than having emotions that make you feel unimportant it can be good at times. tl;dr

Religion is outdated. But. It fills an important role.

Why are we here? What's next? Why did this bad thing happen to me? Look at all these people, they compete for my education, my job, my housing, my future wife... they are my enemies! Why should I not harm others?

There are a bunch of questions that are very hard to answer without some fundamental truth - or lacking that, something that you accept as fundamentally true. kendrick lamar once said: ""fuck your ethnicity""

thanks

also today is ash wednesday They like to say that religion brought people together. No. It united certain groups of people to become stronger than other groups of people so that they might kill and decimate them. Fuck all Religion. Yes - otherwise religion will fuck us all! Can I have an Amen...!!! Someone get this guy some Jesus in his life ASAP! Well that’s certainly one opinion Look into the church of the flying spaghetti monster.  This is the only understandable religion imo. It ain’t that bad.

I guess it’s because religion has never been a negative thing in my life, and I’ve been lucky to be born into a country that allows me to practice what I want, in a community that is forgiving, and for a family that doesn’t judge.

I literally do not care what my neighbors believe or don’t believe. I agree Thank you, you are better than every god bothering nobody I am glad they burnt petrol pump, at least someone is unhappy because of hiked fuel prices :D Please talk about economy at this stage man please, people were saying the growth rate has been negative but since the 2020 has started I have heard or read no news on how the economy is going. I 100% agree, well said Religion is Politics. Something you use to keep society under control. But I wouldn't use the f word here. Some people are good enough to do things on their own but plenty others need guidance.
And once again a rookie mistake of connecting Deity with Religion. 
The one who follows religion is the one who follows the rules of society. But the one who seeks God is the one who renounces all possesion and abandons the social life. I like this one It is superstition, like ghosts or bigfoot I really really wish Ravi Zacharias could respond to some these comments. It would be hilarious and sad at the same time... I didn't know I had a twin in India. Wishing you a great life friend. Too Right 👏 I completely agree, especially with all the shit going on in Delhi rn Yup, finally someone said it. 👍🏻 Finally someone who gets it and is talkong sense. Religions are one of the biggest cancers of the world right now. And if you really believe the bullshit they tell, i dont know what to tell you... Life isnt a fairytale Now this is a good post! Religion is like spoiled milk. Hey fuck you buddy 👉🏻

MODI GANGGG 🇮🇳 Hoes mad Time to sort by controversial Life was a party till religion came along..

Humans still understood right from wrong because they have emotions... understanding right from wrong is all that matters... If only people have the will and the mind to believe what they actually believed all these years is utter bullshit. I can only imagine a better world without religion. More morale, more discipline, and a whole lot of love. Thank you OP, you are correct. Very well written and I wish you the best.

There are some wonderful Bollywood anti-religious movies available. These three movies are quite funny and a few of my favorites. 

[Dharam Sankat Mein ('Religion in Trouble')](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4354740/?) - *At the age of 55, a Hindu man discovers that he was born Muslim and adopted by a Hindu family.*  It has a score of 6.3 on IMDB; 

[PK](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2338151/?) - *An alien lands on earth and acts so crazy they ask if he's 'PK' which means 'tipsy' or 'drunk.'* It has a score of 8.1 on IMDB; and 

[OMG: Oh My God](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2283748/?) - *An atheist files at lawsuit against God.*. It  has a score of 8.2 on IMDB.

[Here's a list of 7 movies that reflect the dark side of religion.](https://in.bookmyshow.com/entertainment/movies/hindi/bollywood-movies-on-religion/) Those three are on that list, as well as several that look serious.  I just posted asking why religion is a sensitive topic and everyone downvoted and this has 2.9k likes xD Yo what pissed you off to this extent man? If it brings people happiness.and peace of mind.  It’s wonderful.  And it’s fun to think about what came first the chicken or the egg. Who is reading this in 2020? You're a good person for this, OP. I respect your opinion I see that title, I upvote. Isn't it ironic that almost all atheist have a God complex ? Finnaly something I can read...lmao Here from /r/all and I just wanted to say, **hell yes India!**  Your country seems amazing in many ways, but also so damn backwards... TIL that ""atheist"" or ""none"" is not even an option for official religions/beliefs in your country.  When you look at the trends for how humanity is progressing, almost every advance is met by a decline in religion.  
Get that shit outta there!  
And this, from a 'spiritual' person, Buddhist/Atheist, functionally agnostic, and Canadian, for context if it matters.  
May you all be well and happy, may you all be at peace. Congratulations, you've just explained the core of Buddhism!  I'm only partly joking. Buddhism's main tenents are non-theistic and are about abandoning attachment in order to live fully in the moment and see the world clearly.  But I get your point. Man I wish more people could read this. The whole country needs to read this! a wise man once said Religion is the opium of the masses.. any guess who? but in india that ideology is also made a villain by constant propaganda. if anyone can kick sanghi asses its them. The early people realizes the best. What makes me angry the most is that it is killing the scientific temper in our ppl! Preach. Heh.

  


Seriously though. Yes. Fuck'em all. Take it back, Flying Spaghetti Monster is REAL Of course everyone is confused. The universe is infinitely complicated. We shouldn't look down on them for their ignorance. I don't think all religions are bad but I don't think any of them are 100% correct. I do believe there is something after we die. You can't create or destroy anything in this reality. It only changes form. This. Fuck yeah, man. You nailed it; fuck religion! anti-religion and reddit, name a more classic duo They only way to overcome what is happening is Education Education and more Education which is seriously lacking in this nation. Yeah man. All the most horrible stupid people I know are religious. I think it's a direct correlation to not thinking critically and being a blind sheep follower. That's why USA is so fucked up right now. All these idiots believe everything they are told on facebook and white supremacist propaganda sites. Fuck Religion. Finally I don’t know what’s going on in India right now but come on man calm down. A belief is merely an opinion one refuses to reconsider. That, and pride in beliefs is the ultimate in egotism. Let it all go, and people can be free and better. one hundred percent agreed The first part is pretty much what i think about religion as well, it's a very well organized scam to convert people to believe in some bullshit as well as syphon as much money as they can from the individual. Since when a sub about Inda got so smart, you're right tbh Did not expect this post in r/india, kinda refreshing to see this mindset. I am not too keen on religion myself. r/atheism Yeah science is cool! Marx once said, ""Religion is the opium of masses"". I Don't follow his ideology but he straight up was throwing truth bombs in 1800s. Still relevant to this day! As someone who’s never been involved in any religion, I just can’t seem to understand how people can use a collection of stories from 2000 years ago to justify acts of murder and conflict. All religions are just hate groups, but they’re “justified” because they have religious intent. “We hate the gays, but our 2000 year old book says it’s okay, so we are the ones in the right”. Nice post OP, it’s good to know that there is some resistance to the brainwashing that is religion How about fuck the people who cant respect other people's beliefs without murdering them and destroying their places of worship I disagree with the part where you know what happens after death. No one knows it and no one will ever know. Just impossible. It could be a big simulation for example. Fuck all your beliefs as well. Coronavirus knows no religion and likely coming soon. The great equalizer. https://suchanek.name/texts/atheism/index.html Came out the gate swinging There is a Facebook group for atheist parents if people are interested. It’s called Godless Parents. I don’t use Facebook much but wanted to throw out that option. The group is for getting support and ideas on raising children outside of any faith and how to deal with family/friends/schools who sneak it in. Religion shouldn't exist in the 21st century.
It exemplifies human weakness to keep depending on a false sense of hope that doesn't exist.
I hate it to the core, probably this is the one thing I hate the most in the world. All things that further separate us from one another (such as religion) are things we ought to step away from as soon as possible. Finally a person who speaks the truth Ok but who the fuck started imagining blue monkeys and elephants as gods, fucking polytheists Whilst I do agree with everything you said, confirmation bias will insure that your words fall on deaf ears when they are most needed.  Humanity can be both awesome and terrible.  I would like to think the awesome will win out, but I fear it will not.  Best of luck.  Maybe you will get some people to hear your message. Look up a guy named Mark passio on YouTube bro. You won't feel so isolated in your thoughts. Sort by controversial. Don't forget to get your popcorn Here here dear friend!! Ok, but how does that have anything to do with India... I used to feel that religion was the bane of mankind, but I’ve evolved into the idea that it’s irrationality that’s the issue, not really religion. I know many religious people that don’t reflect the worst of their cohort, and it’s trivial to demonstrate that non-religious societies often replicate the worst aspects of religious behavior. What passes for “religion” in most places is really just a combination of bigotry and self-interested politics. Background: I run a humanist, atheist organization, and I don’t like religion. Love of God/ Fear of Wrath of God ..... whichever way you look at it , whats has been significant?:

the pain and misery has been caused becuase of it 
or
the amount of pain it has prevented/ aleviated.

Each will have a different opinion on this.

Maybe we can look at it a different way:

Everything starts out with a good purpose and intentions .... but along the way certain individuals find a way to contort/skew/misinterpret/misrepresent relegion to their advantage and greed.

Faulting religion for the misdeeds of individuals of use it for their greed and gluttony is like blaming the easy target.

The emotional reponse of Love and Hate are equally strong and powerfull.
These miscreants know that faith is so emotionally engrained/entwined in us that we would repond to it strongly.

Triggering an emotional response in us based on hate  is easy for these people.
thats what they are gud at.

Hate these individuals.
Dont hate the faith.

If it was easy to be nice and kind then there wouldnt be any pain and sadness in the world.

it's in times like these that ones needs to find compassion and kindness in their heart for one and all. Based on the current events I am feeling proud for leaving religion. Still my family is extremely relegious but both me and my sibling has permanently left relegion. You too have your religion m8, so shut up! I don't give a fuck what anyone else believes as long as they make the world a better place. Fuck yeah! When it comes to bullshit, big-time, major league bullshit, you have to stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims, religion. No contest. No contest. Religion. Religion easily has **the greatest bullshit story ever told**. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there’s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever ’til the end of time!

But He loves you.  - George Carlin Amen Oof India is absolutely driven by religion. Remember friends, sort by controversial ;) Thank you! This guy gets it. I agree I like how this was put under the flair politics, because ultimately that is what all of religion is, powerplay politics Yawn. Fuck off. 
Believing in something does not make you any less valid. 
Believers can be just as kind and good for the world as anyone else.
Keep on with your anger and hate, I live each day to the fullest and only think about my religion based on how grateful I am each day. 
You are not special for not believing in anything. 

Organized religion is damaging but the instant you go after people's personal beliefs you become an asshole. I'm a kind person but fuck off. Start with eating beef Edgy Damn, knowing the people on Reddit I fully expected this post to be downvoted to hell. I guess you were lucky Today my exam didn't go well exactly and my grandma blamed it all on my black shirt. They say its not the black colour god day. Honestly am i to laugh or use this fact as an advantage . Perfectly summed up, really well said. Having a religion is like totally not believing in yourself Damn.. Never thought I'd see this in an Indian subredit. Our country is pretty religious.  I've never really met another atheist and we can't be vocal here.  

I must agree that religion is a major source of unrest in India. It's getting scary. I love this country but I can't say I'm proud of it. 

It seems that for every step forward, we take two steps back.  I'm hoping that change will happen and I do plan on doing my part in it. This is lame  Exhaust people loose morals without religion. People say “tHaTs NoT tRuE” but have no evidence for that besides atheist are nice sometimes. You don’t have to believe and people shouldn’t force you to believe but don’t talk bad about it. You just sound like an asshole, like saying “FUCK FAMILIES because theirs a big universe and spending time with them is a waste of to me.” Some people value families like religion so don’t be such a fucking dick about it. I agree that religion has caused nothing but trouble on a large scale. I'm strongly against organized religion because it tries to make claims about the unknowable and dictate how other people should live based on these beliefs. Which is also what this post, and athiests in general, also do yet never seem to realize it. Self aware wolves, the lot of you.

No one knows if there is a God or not. No one knows if there is heaven or hell. No one knows that upon death it's simply black and nothing. No one knows the truth to any of this with any certainty at all. In this regard, atheists are just as infuriating as theists. Both sides make claims about he unknowable and try to dictate how others should live and believe based on their own personal beliefs. What makes them comfortable. 

It takes a tremendous leap of faith to believe in god and a tremendous leap of faith to disbelieve. Neither side is right just because they shout it at you.

Believe whatever you want. Let others believe whatever they want. Recognize you have no way to know who is right or wrong about the unknowable, and leave each other alone when it comes to their beliefs.

The general messages about good character from religion are great. Some people need that from a book, others don't. All religions share the general message of ""don't suck"" and ""be good to others"". Just do that and you're probably winning this game.

Personally, I believe in god completely. I believe in an afterlife. But I completely reject all organized religion because of the reality that no one knows the truth on any of this, along with most major religions having thousands of years of murder, rape, and pedophilia under their belts. I don't need someone else to tell me what to believe or think about the unknowable, especially not someone or some organization with that track record and lack of humanity in direct contradiction to their messages.

Basically, if anyone tries to tell me what to think about the unknowable, theist or atheist, they can piss off. You don't know anything. No one does. Sit down, shut up, and let people believe whatever they want about such things. I wonder what happened to this guy... lmao. TLDR;
I guess the post heading sums it up. I’m with you bro. Fuck all religion except mine./s I fully believe religion is main hindrance to the progress of the human race and people just go around wanting to ‘respect’ others and their ‘religions’. It’s all bullshit. Modi Failed India big time. He failed economy and now Delhi is burning. He needs to act fast and step down before whole india get burned. Anger comes from things you don’t understand.  

One day you will.

Till then stay angry my friend. John Lennon was ahead of his time. I wish I had coins to award this post (unfortunately I don't have any till now lol). One of the best posts I have seen here. Truth!! 💯 You go India man or woman or not determined yet! Religion is a mental illness. Simple. I'm not a big fan of religion either, but I'm also not going to shut someone down if they're using it as a coping mechanism. As long as they aren't a dick about it and are actually a good person, they can use whatever they want to cope. There's worse things than religion. So what if they're afraid of death? I'm happy you're taking that reality so well but some people struggle to the point where their life is seriously impacted, and a small glimmer of hope that is an after life can improve their quality of life. Amen to that you know... some of what youre saying isnt too far off, but on the other hand some of it is fairly ignorant   

  

for example, you state that death means you cease to exist as if it's a matter of fact.  you're certainly confused and I will attempt to lead you toward objective fact as opposed to your opinion.  

  

first thing to recognize is, youre having an identity issue.  you seem to think that you are your body. (you've identified with it)  and when the body dies, it must mean you die too. that's not quite accurate.  you are not your body.  if you lose  an arm for instance, you've lost a part of your body, but you havnt lost yourself.  you still exist.  that's because what you are is something more, beyond name and physical form. so what are you?  well the truth of the matter is, you are life. you are the life allows your physical body to function. and when you, the life, departs from that body it will be dead.  but you can not 'lose your life' when you ARE life.  you just move on to a new form.  

  

no i know this may seem like it took a religious turn as im essentially talking about what is generally known as 'reincarnation', but the simple fact is there's a fuckton of evidence for it.  sure the ancient religions have known for a while, but similar to you, im over religion, i dont find it very useful.  I with off the top of my head I could remember a lot of good sources that show the reincarnation must be an actual thing, as I have seen many, but just to get you started, there is a documentary called 'the boy who live before' I believe.  I could describe it but its better to just judge for yourself.  Basically a child is able to remember his past life, and they track down his old town, old house, family etc.. and its a great mystery how he knew all the details of that old life...  

  

in any case, you right in that you dont need religion.  in fact the just conflate and confuse things, but dont stop looking for answers!  you dont have it all figured out Dont hate the game,  hate the player. Best reddit post ever! Yeah. Fuck it all. Damn look at the amount of foreigners here I don't think it's the religious experience of individuals that is so destructive but institutionalised religion alias the church that blinds people and detaches individuals from what religion really is. I mean, we're making examples of all the war and futile deaths that came as a cause of religion but come to think about it, how many of the people who committed those acts were truly religious. Almost none of the christian community live by the example of Jesus and the bible, they follow it because it's what the mass does and the more you just follow the mass, the less individual you become. 

So let's not say fuck religion.

Fuck the Church. Fuck Creed. Fuck the institution. Word. I'm gonna print this and hang it in my room. Sad but true religion is bad. If Trump can  cheat on 3 wives and still be considered Christian and appointed by god by the evangelical community then somethings something wrong with it. Yeah, yeah, we get it. Anyone with an ounce of ability to think critically can tell that organized religion is magical nonsense. This isn't something that's susceptible to rational argument, however. Your arguments aren't going to change the minds of the devout, and you aren't telling us anything new. Most of the violence in human history has been over material resources or ideology. Got it.

Instead of simply shitting on everyone who feels differently than you do, why not take a more scientific approach? *Why* do most people on earth subscribe to one religion? Why do humans believe in god(s)? Instead of just telling people that they're wrong (with numbers, charts, and diagrams to illustrate the depth of their wrongness,) isn't it time to address the more fundamental, underlying issues at work? Religion isn't something that's *being done* to people, it is ubiquitous, and it appears in isolated populations. As far as I know, there isn't a human culture, now or in historical record, that was without religion.

I suspect that your frustrations are caused by two things: religious or magical thinking, and a willingness to exploit people who rely on magical thinking. The first I find to be strange, and quite interesting, while the second is common and reprehensible. Don't confuse ""the church"" (or any other religious authority) with religious thought.

I'm an atheist, and I've never been part of any religion. I accept most of your position, but if you're willing to ask people to shed their beliefs and adopt yours, why don't you try a little experiment? For one month, learn all you can about one, particular religion. Learn about its history, art, culture, tenets, writings, and if possible spend time with adherents. Go to a house of worship, shrine, temple, or whatever. Set your reservations completely aside for one months, and immerse yourself. Deeply, honestly pursue an understanding. Leave your preconceptions behind (they'll be there at the end of the month when you need them,) and try it. If you pick Islam, pray five times a day. Whatever you pick, stick with it, and keep your critical mind on a shelf, for the moment.

Isn't telling people that a mode of thought is worthless, harmful, and destructive a little bit... wel... uninformed, if you aren't willing to attempt to see the world from their perspective first? What you've said takes guts to say in front of public. Imagine saying something like this in public. Probably the person would get lynched. I too believe religion instead of being a solution has been root of many problems more than often. At least the younger generation in metropolitan cities can accept the concept of atheist and that's some kind of progress, but definitely people need to be more accepting and hopefully that will change in future. Excellent post. Consider the vastness of the universe, with 99.9999% being unobservable to us, and consider the unsuitability of almost all of the observable universe towards life.


Then consider that we exist here now, on a rock floating around in nothingness around a burning hot mass of gasses, hurtling away from all such pairs at celestial speeds spreading out further into oblivion.


Consider the astronomical odds for every event that played out exactly as it did to lead up to us existing here now, and then multiply them with each other to get the infinitismally insignificant chances of us existing, and yet here we are.


Untill we are able to explain how or why, religion will continue to exist. Fun fact: Because of religion killing and hunting all nonbelievers and scientists in the medieval ages and earlier, humanity devolved a thousand years. Think bout that. Shit dog, don't hold back next time. See that guy over there, eating dinner with his family just like us? He's a different religion and deserves to die.

That's how stupid our fucking world is. I think the problem is extremists. I believe everyone should be able to believe whatever they want as long as it doesn't affect everyone else. Why can't people just leave each other alone. The world would be a better place if people just respected each other's beliefs and not shove them down each other's throats. People should be able to treat each other like the human beings that we are no matter what religion or beliefs we have. If your religion condemns something someone else is doing, then leave them alone to be condemned. It doesn't affect anyone else's life but theirs. I'm not religious but I respect what people believe in even if I dont believe in those beliefs because it doesn't affect me in the least. I'm ok with anything as long as it doesn't violate anyone's basic human rights. Extremism is the real enemy. Saw this on popular. C’mon man I’m an atheist but if you want religious people to take you seriously you can’t be aggressive about it The problem is not religion it's religious extremists. Religion can be used for good and bad there is more than one side to it. This guy gets it I wouldnt say “Fuck” all religions, but I would say before you can be anything, you must first be a good human being with a clean heart. OP a lil much, you can be a good person and demonstrate great values all while being religious, some people just are not. I love how the subject is religion, yet these autistic ducks of reddit are talking about America  imperialism in the comments, this has to be the most ADHD social media platform on the planet. I thought I was in r/UnpopularOpinion How did I end up here I support you Bae, fuck all religions Sanket? what a fucking reddit moment Religion is messed up I agree. I do believe in a God as the chances of everything aligning so perfectly for life to be formed is minuscule. You may disagree with me but I'll believe what I want to believe. I dont force it on others and I respect their opinion as long as their opinion isnt like OP's, calling people out and saying they are stupid and dumb. There isn't proof of god but there isnt proof against it either. Lack of proof is NOT proof. Well, damn. Congratulations. Cringiest thing I've read all day I wish we could blame it on religion, but I think humanity would still find a reason to destroy itself. Our nature is conflict, religion is just an excuse. Totally agree.. We humans are the worst creature so brave So glad to see this on front page with 12k upvotes.

&#x200B;

How the fuck is centuries old religion still mainsteain in 2020, after we've explored space to such an extent and made such scientific advancements, I will never know.

&#x200B;

Remember the Sun was a deity? Oh, that's a ""false"" religion, got it guys. But that noahs ark shit, pretty hardcore. Oh, you don't believe THAT part? Go fuck yourselves. [deleted] Hail Satan. Thank you for saying this. This was beautiful, thank you. wow very brave! I am not religious but I have to disagree with you. There are a lot of people who need a religion to function. They just go with the rules because they are afraid of their gods but not of other people. They would turn into criminals if they accept that religion is completely made up. Other people need it so they don't feel lonely in this world. Religion can be a beautiful thing but sadly it's used mostly for bad things. Please let other be believers and mind your own business. I don't believe in anything but don't mind other people having a made up God in their life as long they're being respectful to others. If they are not it's because they are raised badly or have other issues, but not because of religion itself. It was made so people behave, to avoid chaos. And back then they didn't had the answer to certain scientific questions and used ""God"" as a simple answer to everything. Some people don't wanna hear the complicated answers and want to live a simple life. Let them be. >Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 

Man, they could start a religion about this! Also fuck Modi You forget religion is the only reason humans coordinated on large scale in the first place, without it we would still be barbarians. Not that I believe in god or anything to that effect, humanity would have been doomed without it, but now that we have scientific basis for our actions we are just now approaching a point in time where we *shouldent* need it, so please don’t bash religion too hard, it has its place in our world even to this day. Once someone told me as a kid all the the Greek gods were fairy tales I stopped believing, why is theirs fake but ours real? Religion is complex, I don't know much, but I know religious people who are exceptional people and I know that most have some good philosophys in them. They're probably not suited to our modern age, but their part of our history and culture, so there isn't a need to push it away; maybe to just see it as it is, a belief, nothing more. I have a genuine question, how many people think the world's wars would just stop if there wasn't religion? Do you think the corruption just ends because the veil it's hidden behind is gone, or do you think it would still go on because in reality it's all about greed and power and control?

   My belief is religion is just a tool used to further the end result, and if it wasn't/isn't religion, it's color, or it's geographical location, or it's wealth, or it's because they're shorter, or speak a different language, etc etc there's always going to be some bias that divides people, and there will always be a mask to hide behind to do it. 

  I'm someone who finds comfort in having faith in something because there's a lot left we really don't know, whatever my idea is, but I don't ignore scie xe, and I don't go out of my way to harm people who don't believe, or believe in something I don't. I do agree that the power structure of it should be taken down, and it's disgusting what it causes, but it's the people that hide behind it that are the problem. I tried athiesm but, realized it was also a belief - George carlin Man the edge on this Fuck yeah!! Buddhism actually isn’t a religion that has the “answers” it’s actually about to let go of all the worries in the world like (where u go after u die) and simply quiet the mind  and humble yourself because we simply don’t know!! Insult people in an effort to convince them they're wrong? Solid strategy. Spot on brother man. My “religion” is just treating people like I want to be treated. I know crazy right? Agree on every single points made. Hope more people actually get the message. These man made fairy tales are distracting the masses from progressing together. And instead introducing hatred and twisted views on our own species. Religion has seriously fucked up mankind and its realistic views on the world and created nothing but death and suffering on many levels. And your donation money definitely isn't going to that charity, it's going in father Matthews pocket. As OP said, everyone please wake up. >You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe.

if thats true then just let people believe what they want to believe REDDIT MOMENT im satanist Amen brother! Are indians just now realizing this? Religion is the opiate for the masses Religion is an MLM/Pyramid scheme.  Always has been, and always will be.

Start taxing religious organizations and things will change instantly. Fuck religion. Amen religion isn't really about religion. it's more like political strategy. unfortunately, it works on most people. 67% upvoted , everyone has entitled to their beliefs and that should be. I read an interesting article which basically explained why science can't make countries adopt secularism. Anyway I'll leave a copypasta here:

Religion is like a penis. It's fine to have one, ok to be proud of it, it's even ok to share it with someone if they ask. But it's not ok to shove it down someone's throat against their will!

...and keep it away from children! I mean I don’t believe in any religion but these kind of posts just make me uncomfortable, I think the less you worry about other people’s personal lives the better. Idk why this is r/India but I’m here for the drama! As much as I agree with you, how can you say that our legacy should be to better mankind, when in the end no matter how good mankind is everything ends the same? No one will be remembered for long, no one will will remember if you were a good person or not, so all wrong doing is pretty much as justified as doing the “right thing”. And like you said, spec of dust flying through space, a soon to be (in the cosmic scale) desolate spec of dust just like everything else. So in reality there is no “immortality” for us as you say. Wow... I'm speechless... Sometimes I wonder if trophies like NFL rings, Oscars, nominations, NBA trophies, etc. are just another object people idolize like how people worshipped cows. Kind of sad seeing it happen right in front of our eyes. 'Fuck' religion that **tells people to go hurt/kill other people.** And 'fuck' **dogmatism.**

But on the other hand, your idea that religion is there simply to provide people comfort against ""death"" is not something I necessarily think is proper. For me, some religious afterlives are worse than just having nothing at all - e.g. Buddhist Hells.

>What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe.

From a really cold empirical science perspective, you can say, it almost surely won't. And if you're going to adopt that stance, you should be honest about that. Everything gets reduced to entropy in the end, photonic gas, and 99.9999% of us will be forgotten in no more than a few generations at the very best, and the few that aren't had a lot of probability work in their favor to get them there.

If you want to argue for a worldview rooted solely and purely in cold, hard empirical science, then you have to go **fully** honest about it and the things that *really* make me pop my head are not so much things filled up wholly with lies but which have a large quantity of truths and then *one little snag*.

And I'm not saying that somehow ""proves"" religion right. I'm saying that if you are going to argue it this way, you *should be* honest about it.

**Any** kind of *dogmatic ideology*, I find, is poison. It doesn't matter if it's religious or not. What matters is that it does not tolerate dissent. What matters is if you have decided those who refuse it are evil. All political ideologies go the same way, and the toxic effect of treating them dogmatically and intolerantly is every bit as plain as for religion. Interestingly, you have done just that, and said everyone who believes in religion is ""😈evil😈"". Good, I'll keep being 😈evil😈 then. Proud 😈Devil😈 here. Just as I'll keep being ""😈evil😈"" in the view of any other dogmatist who tells people to just suck up their dogma and don't critically evaluate each bit of it with a fine grained comb and I'll almost always find something to disagree with. Including ""religious"" dogmatists, too, of any stripe. Dogma systems are straitjackets for the mind. Any system that one cannot be flexible with or reserve adherence to all its tenets, inflexibly, rigidly, under threat of personal invalidation, is a mental straitjacket and exactly the kind of poison your *legitimate* points rightfully indict.

And believe it or not, saying ""I *believe"" or* ""I *don't believe*"" in ""God"", are *both* actually equally and more honest than saying ""I *know*"" the answer to this, or asserting it as an absolute fact. There is a hubris in both believing that we can *know* beyond the limits of our sense and empirical experience, as much as there is in believing that actual reality must be coterminous therewith. Neither such statement or confidence can be justified based on reason. We can only justify what we *have* verified empirically, and anything past that is where we must cease to condemn and chastize disagreement. In full honesty, we cannot even *know* the ""laws of physics"" continue forever. Our empirical evidence, our *experience*, gives us no reason to *suspect* they will break, and can give us *confidence* in them, but they just *might*, and maybe there are places they don't apply that we haven't found yet. One can, of course, pull out the Russell tea pot argument and say it's irrelevant, but my point is not to argue its relevance any more than its correctness, but rather to argue against your moralism of people, which is as reprehensible as that which has flowed from the mouth of any authoritarian religious preacher in any religion.

People should not be considered vile for *whatever* they believe in this matter. I have no problem with you going for atheism, I have a **big** problem with you calling people evil, simply on dint of a *belief*. **That** is what leads to all the horrible things you rightfully indict.  You or someone like you may become the next persecutor. The only way to stop persecution is for everyone to respect disagreement.

And no, I'm not then saying ""persecute the persecutor"" or ""persecute the ones who say people are evil"". I am voicing both my own disagreement and my intent to not be daunted by your taunts. Some thousand years ago, the purpose of religion was not to create chaos as it is today, rather to create a civilisation and induce fear of God so that man may not commit wrong deeds.

Today, we have nations and better human development systems like schools and universities and hence we don't need religion.

I always say, religion is a tax which we are paying.

Now, not having a religion does not mean god does not exist, and if atheism is based on the belief that God does not exist, also give rise to a religion where people believe unequivocally on the non-existence of a non-existent.

So, it is better to have God but no religion. I used to think this was true. But recently I've realised that religion is just a stick for people to hang their tribalism and prejudice on. 

You could remove all religion tomorrow and we'd find something else to fight over. In fact you can already see it in politics and things like Brexit. 

The troubles in Northern Island were labelled as religious but really they were territorial and tribal. I'm pretty sure it's the same in the middle east. 

Religion just gives you a rule book or some easy way to pit yourself against someone else. Fuck religion I agree with everything this enlightened gentleman said. People need comfort, religion gives them comfort.

People need to feel good about themselves, and religion makes people feel good about themselves (at the expense of others) Yes. This. Religion is a distraction from any complexity. People hate people because <insert your text here> [religion, caste, race, age, gender, national origin, color, ethnicity, political views... Etc etc] Religion was invented by power hungry elites to control the generally ignorant population. I second this. I'm an ex Muslim Indian. Fuck ALL religions. You know what, amen to this! In bible first murder was also to get recognition from god... But they dont see that.. The thing is if the God didn't meddled with Able and Cane's life for getting sacrifice.. the story would have been different... ya, but as the people join atheism, they will use that to oppress the one with religion. Religion is not the problem, people using it to their advantage and manipulating others is. If you think joining atheism may do some good, wait till some atheist goes and beats up religion following people.

I don't think any religion serves hate, and those who really practice religion are not goons. 

sorry for bad English and typos if any. I am gonna come back to this and gain my sanity when I seem to lose it. Thanks! Care about yourselves and the people around you. We build this world, not God or anything else. We don't know all the answers, but we will find them step by step. I’m not a religious person but is this is such a Reddit tier post. Genghis khan didn’t kill millions of Chinese and Iranians out of Tengrism. Tribalism is inherent to humanity, we will always find a reason to divide and hate Humans observe something.

Humans try to explain that something. 

Humans fail to do so.

Humans create imaginary power to explain thing they failed to explain previously.

BAM religion.

Now, humans do science.

Now, science succeeds in explaining things that were previously unexplainable.

Now, despite having scientific evidence and explanation of stuff, (some) humans still believe in religion instead. 

&#x200B;

Science and religion cannot coexist. 

Religion must be excluded from politics in and shape or form.

Anything that has to do with religion should not be supported financially by the state and therefore by taxes. All financial support for anything religious should be shifted to support causes which are based on science.

&#x200B;

everyone should still be free to believe in whatever he or she wants. No one should get any disadvantages from doing so, but (and that is the important part!): no one should get any benefit from doing so either. And everyone who tries to manipulate anyone else in believing into something that he or she does not yet believe in, should face trial for religious missionary work, which should be illegal to begin with. Being Atheist and being a human is the best thing to be in this world. Amen! EUPHORIC Preach brother! Can't we just use some made up religion for ids like dinkoism or the church of flying spaghetti monster? I applaud you for your courage. Hopefully India breaks free of it's chains and can finally start being a secular nation, or at least, a nation where the separation of Church and State is upheld.

Good luck to you and your country friend. I've been calling myself a Hindu atheist for 3 years now, since the age of 15. I was proud to belong to an ancient culture of tolerance, peace and justice. I was proud of our customs, ways and multiple traditions, hence I called myself a Hindu atheist, even though I rejected all religion and their philosophies including Hinduism. Today, I no longer want to be called a Hindu. I no longer want to associate myself with tribalism. Religion is a threat to life. Religion is organized crime. Religion does not belong in developed societies. Religion is the preamble to barbarism. No religion can take moral high ground. Fuck Religion. I officially denounce hinduism. Those many medals are giving me anxiety . Oh my god .

🤣 Imagine there's no heaven

It's easy if you try

No hell below us

Above us only sky

Imagine all the people living for today


Imagine there's no countries

It isn't hard to do

Nothing to kill or die for

And no religion too

Imagine all the people living life in peace, you


You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one

I hope some day you'll join us

And the world will be as one


Imagine no possessions

I wonder if you can

No need for greed or hunger

A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you


You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one

I hope some day you'll join us

And the world will be as one Nicely written, it will hit the ""Fake religious ego"" named as ""Religious sentiment"" of the religious extremists.

I'm not an atheist but I love when the ego of any religious extremist gets hurt, I just absolutely love watching their so called ""religious sentiment"" getting hurt because all these morons have ever done is distract everyone from the real problems, cause riots, hurt human lives. you just put my thoughts into words.. happened to stumble upon this and thank you. I thank OP for posting this. I feel the exact same way . Glad to see someone vent it out I wish I saw this when I was like 8 I was already a non believer but was to scared to tell anyone Happy that you said it and the kind of response it got. Opium of the masses as Karl Marx said. I agree, from the uk >None of your religions are without blood in your hands. 
Buddhism enters the chat Yes my friend! A thousand times yes! Edgy I kinda respect religion but yeah I feel you Science flies you to the moon, religion flies you into buildings. From the series Mr Robot



Is that what God does?

He helps?

Tell me,

why didn't God help

my innocent friend

Okay, fine.

Forget the one-offs.

How about the countless wars

Okay, fine.

Let's skip the random,

meaningless murder for a second,

shall we?


How about the racist,

I'm talking about all

organized religion...

Exclusive groups

nothing but addicts

who want their hit of bullshit

to keep their...


Their dopamine of ignorance,

addicts afraid

to believe the truth...

That there is no order,

there's no power,

that all religions are just

metastasizing mind worms

meant to divide us

All we are to them

That's just how he owns you.


Even I'm not crazy enough

to believe that

distortion of reality.


So fuck God.


He's not a good enough

scapegoat for me. Edgy. So edgy. I think we're stuck between a fake left wing that just wants to appease minorities and a rightwing that wants to install a tyranny of the majority. When the constitution clearly wants us to put aside the religious differences and want common good for everyone, I don't think, we, people are not ready yet to think in such higher terms. After all these years since we said our good byes to British, we only inherited the golden divide and rule policy to keep people invested in their religious sentiments and derive political and economic returns from them. I don't see a near future where people can see through shit and have a true democracy. It's sad, but it's also a painful truth. You're a horrible person for telling people what they can and can't believe in. Religion is one of the reasons this world hasn't completely gone to shit. Keep your horrible opinions to yourself, no one cares what you do or dont have to say about others beliefs. [I like to watch this scene from Mr. Robot every once in a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSQHJXtfpE) Bhai everyone here already knows all this. If your intent of writing this post was to make people ""woke"" then you should post this on family WhatsApp groups. If your intent was just to rant, well, then let me tell you that we already understand this perspective. Yes, by all probablility, God does not exist, and even if He does, it is of no consequence since God doesn't interfere in any way we can see. However, I strongly disagree with your notion that religion is the 'root of all evil'. History proves that religuous societies tend to be more successful, likely because people tend to shy away from crime or disobedience if they feel that 'a higher power is watching them.'

More importantly, religion provides us with hope, something to be happy about and look forward to in grim times. What if there were no Christmas or Diwali or Eid? Life would be rather monotonous and dull. The greatest works of art, literature, music, even science were inspired by religion, be it Sufi ghazals, Rennaissance frescos, or Hindu epics. Yes it is true, communal tension and xenophobia is largely a product of religious extremism, but ultimately, religion has done more good than harm.

In the 'grand scheme of things' religion and humanity itself is undoubtably insignificant. However, by pusuing that train of thought any longer than necessary, you end up living a sorry nihilistic life. Instead, it's much more prudent to enjoy the culture and vibrancy associated with each religion, rather than getting swallowed up by fanatacism or depression. 

Religious texts are some of the most enlightening philosophical pieces ever written if you take the time to understand them, and if you've actually read some, you'd realize that it's not the crap about a 'One true God' that is meant to be read, but the centuries of moral and ethical teachings poured into them by countless 'spiritual' leader i.e. basically just modern-day philosophers. Buddhism is actually nice bro. Buuut yeah we get your point. >Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion.  
   
You do realize that everything is made up bullshit. Including ideas like 'equality', 'liberty', 'money'. Things like equality are fantasy born in some human minds. Just like religion. But we embrace it.   
   
The only reality of our species is 'survival'. Thats the only reality. Everything else is fantasy. Equality, religion, discrimination, liberalism, etc. I believe in religion. You can have your own opinion.

If you don't believe it's up to you but claiming that no God exists is more irrational (even mathematically) then saying God does exist.... I understand your sentiments. 

But, tell me, if you're so insignificant, why should anyone listen to you? Why do you feel anger? What special rights do you have? Why not cull humans who don't deliver value to society? Why not go killing each other anyway? It's a one time fun.

Do you realize that the sense of greater good, a belief in rising higher is what sustains us and religion is a byproduct of that?

And you're not able to prove, nobody is, that humans are insignificant. Neither are the religions able to prove that there's a heaven or hell after death.

But the mystics of every religion, who have refined their minds, have philosophies that logically convince us that humans are a superior expression of the force that created the supernovae. OH GOD THIS GUY Okay, I understand where you're coming from. But don't shit on other people's belief, that's pretty rude.

If you wanna shit on anyone/anything shit on the people who differentiate and spread hate based on religion, culture etc etc. Religion helped us, Sapiens, shape our world as it is today. It's a fact that we need common beliefs, be it religion, fiction, science or any other imaginary concept, to work our way up together.

Religion has played its role in bringing us so much further than we expected.

It's sad to see something that was supposed to help us work together, build and design our future has taken a wrong turn into violent extremism and foolishness. Somebody finally fucking understands me. 
I am a 15 year old atheist. I hate that God Who created all the trouble between us. He never existed. So what's the meaning of science if he fucking exists.!?

Fuck you All Religions Well said buddy. This was a good read. Live and let live.. keep thy religion to thy fucking self. Simple fuckin rule. 

They have used this card for far too long to stay in Power.

I do not believe in karma or a higher power, but to be fair I hope who actually caused this! The hate speech deliverers and the people in power who could've stopped this would get the justice they deserve. 

Really shameful to call myself an Indian. religion is the most damaging thing to ever plague humanity. i will never understand why even in 2020 the populace refuse to acknowledge the damage. i want to believe we will someday grow beyond it, but we already should have and the evil might plague us even for another 5000 years. i'm sure there were people who understood this 5000 years ago, and they lost hope for this world same as i do now. If there can be a ""prefer not to say"" for gender, why can't we have a religion that can have the same ideology. Excellent....been waiting for this one. 👏👏 Join r/atheismindia Buddhism is not intended to be a religion my friend, but I agree. Still though, the whole part about being insignificant and matter and the universe and all that, that was very Buddhist lol.

Just to clarify. Buddhism in its core (without all the religious mumbojumbo) is about accepting that everything ends and chilling the fuck out about it so you can be a nice person whos not driven by the constant need reduce your fear of death by indulging in activities that get you nowhere.

But yeah, fuck religions. I am an Atheist and i made my Whole Sikh Family Atheist, let's change them one at a time. My religion is responsible for less death than yours -Andh bhakt I would like to use this to promote r/atheismindia May I propose creating a new sub called /r/indianatheists?

&#x200B;

Edit: Looks like it already exists but is restricted.

In that case, I've created r/atheistsinindia Corona virus in India took 0 life.
Guess how many lives the religion virus took? I didn't know there were so many atheists here, lmao. Happy to know that someone knows the truth. I think this belongs here :

When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month – that’s fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years – that’s a religion, and we are admonished not to call it ‘fake news’ in order not to hurt the feelings of the faithful (or incur their wrath).
          ---Yuval Noah Harari What you are offering is not a solution. But another label that people can put on themselves. And create separate factions with people identifying as this label. Just because you don't pray to a ""made up diety"" does not make it any less religious in a way that truly matters.

Religion is far greater, deeper and broader than you can imagine. Religion stems from a need in humans in general that is fundamental to human nature 

> Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova

I am sure you feel superior somehow. When you curse the religions. Or doubt the sanity of people who follow religion. Or quote random scientific facts as moral arguments. You feel good about it. And you feel that you have found the true path. The path that lesser people don't get, and it is your duty to preach this path to these people.

Sure go ahead. You are free to do so. 

But starting by abusing and disregarding the competition is rarely a recipe for a successful business. Just an analogy. Don't mind me. I am just here to read all the comments............ Trust me the only reason of making religion is to limit the thinking power, iq of a common guy

The same reason is with free internet and free surfing, our perception is made to be controlled by someone else.

AI will take it to another level. Intelligent people are the most difficult people to   govern Wow, very brave post. Let us rise up, gamers, and overthrow the Religion! While I agree with you on religion, I find it really funny when you said. 

>the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.  

The reason I find this funny is because the only way you would actually know this is if you died, experienced it, then returned.  Else, you are just taking it on faith that that is what happens when you die.  

Sure we all know what happens to you body when you die.  But there is literally know way of knowing you stop existing. 

This is why I’m agnostic.  I also don’t believe in organized religion personally.  But I don’t judge people (like you are) for their beliefs, I judge them for who they are. 

This post is no worse than what you are hating. Been trying so hard to tell this to people but damn, I get heat from religious people. They hold no bars either. 

I feel like religious people are what is wrong with this world. If there is a God, well he can go fuck himself. Send me to hell. As a Hindu living outside India... this is really sad to see. The only connection I have to India is the fact that I’m a Hindu. Congratulations on throwing away 3000 years of rich history. Fuck this post sounds exactly like my existential crisis and almost had a panic attack reading it The reason why what you wrote lacks validity is that you talk only in great generalities, and that's where the falsehood lies. What you are referring to as ""religion"" could refer to a very wide and complicated range of human behaviors, cultures, ideas. Your conclusion is really the height of arrogance because you think you're the expert in a bunch of things you clearly know very little about, and in spite of your ignorance you want everyone to follow what *you* decree from your own self as an ideal culture, belief system, behavior, etc. The way you wrote your post, you're acting like you're some freaking prophet come to deliver us the Truth. Sit down, son. Try studying and learning more so you don't sound so ignorant in the future.

By the way, how old are you? 15? You seriously think you're justified in telling all humans on Earth to leave their wisdom and value systems just because you know grade-school level science and history?

>We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.

This is very easy to disprove.

>As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better

Practically speaking, this did not happen. Scientific discoveries in history and advances in technology enabled humans to commit the greatest atrocities ever before witnessed.

>but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed

Baseless assertion, easy to disprove.

You arguments are also hypocritical, because it's just as simple (but equally wrong) to assert that atheism is evil. The greatest instances of mass murder in human history were deliberately carried out by atheists or people following anti-religion ideologies. Fuck religion! RELIGION IS TERRORISM!!!!! This post only shows, how arrogant and actually disgusting atheists can be. i could take my time and dismantle every part of it, but you are definitly a lost cause. >You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe

To main kya job chod dun fir. Important transitions in history are seldom driven  primarily by human wishes. - The Sovereign individual Well, at a certain level, everything is insignificant, which doesn't mean they need to be eradicated. Everybody is entitled to their view, and if that's your view, then so be it. It's an anthropological tendency to form cliques, and humans have evolved this way. It's ""natural"" to not be a pariah. I'd like to go one step above and point out that rather than religion, it's any **-ism** that ends up creating an 'Us vs. Them' at scale and ends up creating the same problems as religion. That's more down to human nature. Religion is something a lot of pacifist humans would like to point as increasing human misery. I'm not saying OP is wrong, he/she is right, to an extent, just that religion is the low hanging fruit in the 21st century. Even **Greed is as bad as Religion** but rarely do humans write gilded posts about **Greed** on this sub (may be there on other subs).

Ironically, most world religions advocated harshly against greed but look where we've all ended up. Is religion the real root of the problem or is it just the **enabler** for flawed humans ?

If it weren't **religion**, it'd simply be some other -**ism** instead: Capitalism or Communism or something else. Humans, in general are not wired for contentment - That is our blessing as well as our curse.

Almost all humans are also wired towards some form of **group-ism**. That's what helped us survive and proliferate as a species (i don't mean individual survival but at group level).

In old days, religions (or more of **shared ideas and traditions** than **polarizing religion** as we call it today) actually helped groups (again, not individuals) to exceed the Dunbar number amongst other scientific advances. While this was perfect for handling large groups where a lot of people don't know each other, not so great for peace when 2 different groups encounter each other with different perspectives of life. That is when religion as we know it today becomes - more of a liability and less of an asset.

So what's the solution ?

**Change human nature to be less power-hungry and greedy and more pacifist across all cultures** \- Easier said than done. That's actually the reason no-one wants to be the first to become pacifist, if your group is relatively peaceful but the other side doesn't care about peace, just greed & resources, well then your group is history. I'm atheist but I think its foolhardy to believe that if we take away religion we'll suddenly be in utopia. It's better to face the fact that life is hard and try to incrementally improve rather than believe there's a magical cure. [removed] Bahut hi badhiya likha gya, badhai ho iske liye.

Yes BJP plays a communal brand of politics and flames the fire whenever it can, but that's not the whole picture here. In our country it is taking shape as a communal issue. Religion is just the top most class in a hierarchy for classification.There will be always something to classify humans,right now it's name is ""religion"". There was a philosopher who argued that mainstream Religion caused less violence, as it brought smaller groups into one large group, rather than smaller groups constantly fighting amongst themselves. Not sure I agree with this, but an interesting viewpoint Dunno have you tried religion without casteism?

Seriously tho, there is a south park episode along these lines. Actually it's a 3 or 4 partner where cartman goes into the future to get an x box. It involves talking otters.  “Certain linguistic anthropologists think that religion is a language virus that re-writes pathways in the brain, dulls critical thinking.”  - Rust Cohle (True Detective). Amem brother. Well, TBH, there is a reason why religion works, but people seemed to have taken it beyond that.

Religion is an extremely effective way to buil faith in oneself and his work. 

Faith and belief are Powerful things. It's like a substitute for people who can't believe in themselves. And they've become so deep in the idea of this God helping us throughout life, that thinking otherwise would be inconceivable. i do not think this has to do with Religion, religion is just a cover for people to form groups. Humans being social animals tend to create groups , we see ants of the same species fighting it out to the death in wars, we see lions killing the young cubs to make the females receptive, and do not even get me started on the closest relatives of ours Chimpanzees, i saw a documentary where they literally beat to death and primate of another troupe just because he entered into their territory and proceeded to canibalize him. 

In absence of religion we would just find something else to group  , be it race or region. Is atheism a religion? Buddhism? Come on man, all you're doing is giving thanks for the teachings I used to think like you sometime back. Then I realised we would find reasons to divide ourself and then fight over it. Even in a world without religion there would be something else to divide us by and fight over. Proud atheist here. Absolutely loved reading this on this sub. Ngl, I was expecting a lot of backlash in the replies, but damn, I'm surprised to say the least. Feels good to see so many fellow Indian atheists.

Thanks for the sub recommendation. :) *nidharma vabha* Mahler tho All I'm saying is a gun can't kill a person and everyone's always said religion is for interpretation I'm personally not religious but to say it's shit is pretty stupid. I think most religious books are pretty well written and give great moral stories Pope's rapes children but that's not the study of Christianity. Well you haven't heard about jedi (the religion)........ Yes its a real recognised religion in new Zealand. Yeah man that is like, your opinion. Cause starting with “fuck you” is a great way to open people’s minds.... What did the Buddhists do? Isn't buddhism about self improvement of ones relationship with self and nature? Honestly, I'm atheist and know little about buddhism aside from a religious studies class I took in college but from what I've seen Buddhists are more about preservation of nature and self which doesn't seem bad (comparatively at least) to me. The sun isn't big enough to supernova though You guys are clueless. Religion automatically declines with increase in wealth, as it has in the West. 

The solution is to focus on improving the economy, which our government is also clueless about I totally get where you are coming from and I agree that most of religion is outdated, but I do not believe that it is pointless. My grandma is 70. She has nothing in life remaining other than religion. She would be sitting at home right now just letting her body go to waste but instead she goes to the temple every single day. It gives her purpose. Does that make her weak or a coward afraid of death? I think not. You might have come to terms with the fact that this life goes nowhere and just comes to an end, but it is not an easy concept to grasp. And it gets more and more horrible of a thought the closer you get to death when your body is in pain and your friends and family are withering away. 

Religion provides two things: community and a moral code. Community in the sense that even if you go somewhere where you are out of place, you will find a small group of like minded individuals through the local church or temple or mosque. It is kind of a support system, an extended family. And most importantly, it provides a moral code. Not everyone is born a genius with a perfectly set line on what is good or bad. It is taught. Which is why you can see certain traits throughout religions communities. 

The problem with religion stems in two things: outdated logic-less rituals and religious supremacy. For the first point, there are outdated rituals like not letting females cook or go to the temple during periods that need to be understood and shut down. In the past, when people did not have an understanding of periods and females speaking up was taboo, this ""rule"" made them exempt from their most important daily duties- cooking and going to the temple. It is of course not relevant anymore because people actually talk about periods and understand them and husbands aren't going to force their wives to cook when they are in pain and just need to rest for a bit. The second, and more harmful problem, is religious supremacy. Christianity and Islam actually believe that they are the highest form of religion and their path is the only true path. This is obviously a toxic mindset which belittles everyone else and also why there are religious missionaries trying to convert people into their religion. Hinduism is actually a very inclusive religion that says that there are many paths in life and you can be a good person no matter what path you choose. Unfortunately, this concept is getting lost on a lot of people and hence why we have seen a rise of hindutva.

All I'm trying to say is that here can be a little more nuance than ""fuck religion"" or ""this religion is the only path to salvation"". Word. I understand how you feel man, but what if, you’re wrong? I’m a Christian, I’ve study the Bible. From my point of view, there’s lessons and a lot, and I mean a lot of symbolism. I believe in science too. But sometimes I think about how did the universe start. That’s something I think people have no idea or have a clue on how to think about. They’re all theory’s. The universe is so vast and to think of it as 3 dimensional is pretty incomprehensible. But with my understanding of the Bible, it’s humanity that greatly distorts the underlying message of it.

But if everything is blank after death, I’m fine with that too because there’s versus in the Bible taking about getting some rest and I’m fine with that too lol Friendly reminder- there is still a large number of jews living in Germany today, but it was Hitler who shot himself to death I'm agnostic, but saying that if there was no religion, everyone would be happy and peaceful is plain wrong. Unfortunately we are social beings and so we tend to form groups, be it religion, colour, language, class, culture etc. And sooner or later groups will start fighting with each other. It just so happened that religion became a major cause of conflict You need to take some psychedelics and afterwards you’ll sound silly to yourself saying there is no afterlife/soul. I’m not saying it exists, I’m saying that we as ‘smart’ primates are too stupid to know and as you said we are so insignificant that how can we as a disease to our planet know what happens after death. We cannot and will never know. Just a thought :) > We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.

This is not really true. Ethnic and class identities also divide us. They are probably far more serious than religious differences. How is this post not about a ""religion"" you guys calls ""atheism""?
You are calling all the religions stupid and people believing in it are childish. But on the other hand you are so intolerant to all religions and wants everyone to believe in your beliefs that you were an early man then learned basic skills and tools.
Why you want every religious person to believe in this and not in their scriptures?
Atheism is the most intolerant belief.
Humanity is not about stopping everyone to believe in their beliefs it's about coexisting with tolerance, caring, and respecting each other's opinions, beliefs, actions as far as they are not harming the others. Lots of things divide us that aren't religion. Intelect, socioeconomic status, working class and white collar, sex, politics. Religion is definitely not the only thing. The problem comes with religious institutions being too big and having too much influence over people, not the specific religion in and of itself. I can see though why people wouldn't want it and how there are definitely some religious people that need to wake up to sone sense of reality. Just want to point out that Buddhism wasn't supposed to be a religion, but more a way of life (or a way to get through the suffering that is life)

Admittedly that isn't always the case now, but please don't go hating on all Buddhists.

Also, Buddhism is frequently mixed up with Taoism, which most definitely is a religion. No thx We aren't sure yet whether early religion lead to urbanization (towns and cities), or if those communities lead to religion. It appears that religion came first and actually helped bring us together. 

I get your anger at religion. Except religion is just a tool. Would you blame the knife or the one that wields it. 

Obviously that's an oversimplification of a more complicated issue. 

Attacking people angrily whether verbally or physically isn't go to make them change their beliefs. They're going to dig in and fight back. 

If you really want things to change do it peacefully. I seem to remember a man from India doing just that, and he happened to be religious. What happened that got OP mad? But you know, this is just ur opinion man ok Don’t tell me what to do Well bro, you might want to read Sapiens by Noah Hararj.. explains exactly the need for religion. How it is has been important throughout human history as a way to band people together behind a myth. I myself honestly don't need a religion to respect another human and work with him/her. For me, I sometimes feel that the need for religion has run out its time. But reality is often different and you need to respect every religion and the people who get behind it. Why is it that when a black person gets offended, they try to involve more of their black friends to help gang up on you and leave you no room to talk by being loud and obnoxious? Can they not fight their own battles? Religion can be considered uncessecary, but I feel it's a decent way to teach basic morals that sometimes parents fail to do. Growing up around in a city full of mormons, that's probably the one thing I appreciate from their cult. Not to mention religion is a good outlet to experience and understand a lot of cultures. But yeah the beliefs are fucked Amen!!  Preach brother!! I loled hard when I saw the link to the atheism subreddit in the end. Kinda out of place I felt. I know you're angry because of whats going on but this an emotional argument against religion, not an objective one. You've claimed many things, and several are without proof. You've claimed other things, some with truth. You are entitled to your opinion to hate religion but the reality is we are an insignificant spec in the universe and you don't have all the answers to many of the points you have said so you say ""fuck all"" to it. That isn't a logical solution.

What is logical is to understand why they hate and to fix that. You say religion is whats wrong with the world but you also fail to mention at lack of religion. Look at athiest China and Soviet era and see what they've done. And no this isn't an argument against athiesm, but it is the same point people make when they say thiests kill people over thiests. Besides that, lets be honest, I doubt that the hindu or Islamic scriptures incite people to actively go fight and kill people unjustly and I sincerely believe you don't believe it does either. Many of these hardliner terrorists are uneducated in their own religions and common education, selfish, and just plain pieces of shits that need to die. u/motapi Buddhism isn’t a religion, it’s a path and doesn’t believe in any god. Buddhist can believe what they want but at the core the only thing that makes someone a Buddhist is if they follow the 8 fold path and strive to attain enlightenment Nothing like telling us to open our minds by telling us how to think.

>Religion is evil and makes all its followers evil by extension. 

Objectively evil? I think you get a good idea about religion and beliefs when you watch the ending of Bhool Bhulaiya. Pretty good watch. Will recommend >""be loyal to your species"" . What about other animals & beings dwelling this planet? Isn\`t that the root cause of the problem, serving and taking care only for ones ""believed or look  like our own?  The foundation of all the evil you had pointed out above in the world religion, the selective goodness?

 A person with ""**kindness**"" as a dominant trait would shower it for everyone alike,  as a flower cant be selective in spreading its fragrance to  the audience of its choosing.

Humans are consciously evolved beings, powered by probably the universes most sophisticated nervous system, & backed by a vast database of genome & cellular memories. 

They can discern, choose consciously,  exert intent, they posses great will power, have the ability to introspect and make discoveries. 

That innate power or toolkit is granted to almost every being born of the human womb. No matter the prevailing economic condition, race, geography, or any other external circumstances, this set of toolkit with optimum functioning is available to everyone by birth.

Example, ever ask a child or toddler to kill a bird or conduct this act in-front of her, and it  would not matter which race or religion this child belongs to, they all will show a similar reaction, and express themselves similarly.

That\`s the natures **""inner toolkit**"" working providing hints to ""**right direction /Choices**"" 

You see that every human is in possession of this toolkit, though a lot of us choose to forget using these over the time under the societal conditioning.

Which is sadly driven by the selfish principles like ""acting in pure self interest"" and taking care of those who look like us or believed to be of our own kind""...

Then why do you assert my friend,  that onus of all the wrong in the world is on the **religion(s)** and ""**historical humans**"" who said some words, or asked people like you and me to follow  a certain path.

Why not try and apply all these gifts of chromosomes inbuilt in us, to evaluate & choose for ourselves. Running their discourse on the logic, historical and geographical evidences, experiences and other tools available. - Scientific discovery essentially.

As far as all the misery of the world is concerned, root cause of it everywhere would be the individuals selfishness, and ignoring the hints provided by this inner toolkit. *aka, that faded voice from heart*

We under the influence of **selfishness enticed by greed** , ignored these hints from our innate toolkit, for so long that sadly it has stopped coming anymore for most part...

So, now we are left on the mercy of **""Books""**, **"" scriptures""** and self proclaimed gurus... 

There was a time when there were no books or written scriptures, everyone was relying on the **hints provided by this innate toolkit..**

and then greed and selfishness flashed and some one, at some point, for the first time, must have dared to ignore the hints from inner toolkit and decided to chose otherwise.. That\`s how it begin!

Rest copied, the trend followed and it took us all here... those opposed were ignored or crushed! This is what modern history tells us.

That\`s how & (why must have )  written religious scriptures,  avatars, gurus,  happened on different point of this timeline of deliberate corruption  & suppression of **""inner hints""**

The scriptures and avatars are there to just to remind us humans that we possess a unique toolkit but we are forgetting to use it, and it is not good for us in the long term....

You see, all the religions on this planet in their depths have only pointed us humans to listen to  ""**this inner toolkit**"", where real knowledge happens.

Eventually, some day in the future, a majority of humans will find a way to pay attention to the hints coming from this inner toolkit. 

And all fake knowledge and religions creating illusion of different paths will collapse. As everyone would have the access to the truth and one end. 

In nutshell, all the religion in their current format are serving a purpose, which is to guide humans to somewhere, point them in some direction, and alluring them to walk a path of their choosing...

Apparently, those who were entrusted with the authority to continue poke and remind humans about this core stuff  got corrupted themselves /Stopped listing to their inner toolkit..Some got hijacked (influence of greed / Self interest ) 

In present format majority of these custodians of the original message are only disclosing what suits their interest.

Which is,  taking people to the different extended recursive paths while smartly hiding the essence.  Fitting their vested interests. 

And that\`s causing all the confusion & creating this massive illusion that end destination is also a different place at the end of every path. 

You would see...

yet, IMO, every individual  still has got some access left to this toolkit. We all agree that everyone who lived in the end has to die. All path must converge to one. As all rivers of the world become one water in the vast ocean. 

There are everyday experiences we chose to ignore. 

Those who would continue to ignore ""this hint from the inner toolkit""  will continue to be confused and disillusioned... 

 Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. 

Evil = Bad, and Right = Good  today are mere a label we put to our action based on its outcome. if they suit our interest, label it as good act, otherwise a bad one., isn\`t so!

Does any other animal labels any of their act as a good or a evil ? 

As evident from the above, all the labels of evil and good are inside us, this hint coming from ""**inner toolkit**""  had always picked up the right label without a fail. Or else majority of humans would have been murderers, thieves,  and humanity would not have made this far!

Point is, that nothing is that bad externally, we have chose to ignore the majority of these inner hints as they contradict with our modern definition of good and bad. (Selective / always in self interest ) 

Recent population explosion across the globe has added mostly this ""type(s) of human""  one heavily conditioned  with no support of this **""inner toolkit""** and hence all the chaos we see in the world, as no one has got a clue about what is right or wrong. It is pure selfishness and greed. 

It is us as individuals, who need a fix. 

Start with giving importance to the hints originating from **""Inner toolkit""** which is far more superior and work of millennium of evolution. Sir, so how many pills did you say you have left? Sir...? I believe in Buddhism, not for the myths and legends, but for what it teaches and for its values. Do you think I'm ""stupid"" for believing so? No body else gonna mention how he said fuck Buddhism? But then proceeds to say that all that matters is lovong life in the moment on this earth?? THATS WHAT BUDDHISM IS ABOUT! Making the life you live HERE on EARTH as powerful and meaningful as possible. Do research before you spew hate filled shit all over things you dont even understand. Yeah I still believe in a rebirth sorry Religion is control “Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny.“

So free will? As it was written in the Bible.
And no one where in the Bible did it say we can’t advance as a species? 

And religion doesn’t divide us. It’s sin. Not being left, right, colored, poor, rich. It’s the sinful nature of mankind that fucks up the world. I don't believe in religion, but I respect it, a good person is judged on how you treat others imo, I don't need to believe in religion to accomplish that. Try to live your life as happy as possible, as a kid once said if you can't be happy due to a disability, there is thousands of other things that can make you happy. RIP Sam Berns. Your thoughts are no different from those believing in a certain religion and is much closer to those which believe every other one is wrong. Being here in the now is pretty much the basis of all religion. Chill. Agree. You are kind if summarizing the teachings of Buddhism. K Fuck Prayer rooms. 

Fuck Vaastu. 

Fuck Beef Brigade. Tell me how did the universe start Why are you so mad I don’t understand why you are so upset. You’re kind of doing the same thing as religions would do which is telling people to leave their belief and join yours. Chill Religion =\= spirituality. One can believe there is some higher power or energy without succumbing to an organized religion, and should not be judged or discriminated for doing so. Your first three paragraphs are just an angry version of the core teachings of Buddhism.

Not sure what Buddhists your familiar with, but impermanence and understanding your connection to the universe is literally the closest thing to enlightenment words can describe.

Just so you're aware. People will find a way to divide without religion and I say that as an atheist. If you destroyed religion it would be race, if you destroyed race it would be nationalism, if you destroyed nationalism it would be ethnicity, then language, and so and so forth.

Humans hate.  Religion didn't make us do that.  Hell, many religions are actively trying to get us to stop.

The Nazis didn't need religion to cause the holocaust, or Stalin the holodomor, or the Chinese the cultural revolution.

Humans are the key shitty factor here, not religion. Religion doesn't divide. It depends on who is using it for what ends. 

Don't forget that the largest mass murders were committed by atheists: Mao and Lenin.

Atheist governments can also manipulate humans to murder and hate others because of race, class, etc... Fuck i hope this coronavirus kills all the fucking oldies with their fortified faith in religion potentially bringing in better generation adults into play. Uhm ok? Yep. Couldn't have said it better myself

Cheers I hope I am not too late.

You sure it's just the religion?

God is dead by Nietzsche led to Nazism.

Fuck Nationalism https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=yq4uCWtQE24 lol just let people believe what they want But have you ever tried DMT? Be careful of making progress your religion No. There are SPECIFIC countries causing world unrest. 

&#x200B;

USA (Christian)

Russia (Christian)

China (Atheists) Does religion corrupt people or do people corrupt religion?

I think people will find an excuse to be ignorant and shitty regardless of religion. If it wasn’t Jesus or Allah it would just be something else.

Look at celebrities, famous youtubers, Trump, Bernie, Reddit, corporations, brands, computers, literally anything. People are willing to argue, preach, fight, and die for these with or without conventional organized “religion”.

Who’s to say anything and everything isn’t already some form of “religion”.

People created religion, not the other way around. Even if religion were to magically disappear today, I guarantee it would all start up again in a matter of days with essentially the same shit, just different names.

“Religion” isn’t the problem, it’s people. ?????...... Who hurt you? While I dont disagree with the issues you speak of with religion and who believe it in, I dont believe anyone knows for sure what happens after death. So you really shouldnt say what happens after you die, cause you know...you don't know either. I'd upvote for visibility but downvote for not realizing something simple. So no vote. Shouldnt this be on r/confessions I don’t believe in any god or have a religion but man, this post was just really edgy and kinda sad, just let people believe in stuff, as long as they aren’t hurting people Weird flex my atheist friend, people are gonna believe what they want to believe in. No ones certain where the soul/ conciseness goes when we die, so let us be creative, let us use some imagination. Is it really harming anyone, if it brings peace of mind to people of faith I don't want to sound ironic but, you do know that atheism is technically a religion right?  this sounds like of a closed minded person who's Seriously angry and can't keep it to himself. I resent atheists but I don't go around screaming it at the top of my lungs. 90% of adult life is learning how to bite your tongue and sit on your emotions, And this person sounds like he seriously failed at that. Reddit moment Religion is not perfect. People are not perfect.

>If religion, instead of being the manifestation of a  spiritual ideal, gives prominence to scriptures and external rites, then  does it disturb the peace more than anything else.”

– Rabindranath Tagore This ideology could be a religion in and of itself 0.0

The religion of non-religion. You have as much proof that God doesn't exist then a religious person has that he does. That means zero. You have the right to believe whatever you want, and the right to not believe in anything. But your way of thinking isn't superior to that of one who thinks God exists. This post is very condescending, narcissistic, and shows lack of open-mindedness rather than the intended open-mindedness. It's very little and shows lack of character and a superiority complex. You're not special, and neither are religious people. But what you are that most religious people are not, is disrespectful. I don't it's possible for our star to die in a supernova explosion. It's too small. NOW WHAT!? You and your ilk have a warped concept of what religion is and its purpose. Religion does not establish a nation, it establishes an individual. It is the foundational practice of philosophies that is keeping you alive and making this shit post. All your plights about the history's problems are a result of politics and the absence of religion. I predict your argument: ""look at all the nations and historical events predicated on religion"". Proceed to make that argument and make a fool of all yourselves. They way you spoke about religion was childish. I have to remind myself these are your beliefs or views that you are expressing here and good luck with that. Beautiful It’s crazy but Buddhists Christians Hindus and Jews all life in peace with one another. Didn't read lol

Are you one of those fedora-wearing neckbeards fighting fUnDiEs on the internet? Now that's a sad, pointless waste of time Grumpy bear just joined the chat. *CRAWLIIIIIING INNN  MY SKIIIIIN* Coming from a religious guy, I feel like I’d rather be believing in something that isn’t true and spend my life optimistic for the future with no fear of death than to believe this is it and I’m just destined to be lifeless dust floating in space and who I am will be irrelevant when I die. Just seems depressing to live like that imo. Euphoric I believe in the New Game + Did anyone else read this as Eminem from  the movie 8-Mile

Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer,
fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly

And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty,

Here, tell these people something they don't know about me. This website claims to be so accepting and then a post makes the front of Reddit that is basically straight up shitting on a large some of people that don’t live how the poster wants them to.

Yeah, you fuck off. Fucking hypocrites. We get it dude but seriously... /cringe Not religions fault if followers are idiots to begin with! What is your aim with this post? Any argument that starts with telling people to fuck themselves is going to create nothing but hatred. That's not how you start a constructive conversation. Religion is a powerful thing created by geniuses among us use it wisely it can unit people of different cultures,Color,ideology etc but it can also can cause downfall of a civilisation . ok there goes reddit with its childish anti-religion atheistic boner. Seriously how many brains cell does one need to understand that its humans that are the fucking problem, that if there was no religion i guarantee we would FIND something else to muder each other over? Religion isn't a bad thing. Religion doesn't kill people. People kills people. Religion is just an excuse. Anyway, it's not possible to say if gods exist or not. Just because they don't interfere directly doesn't mean that they don't exist. I agree. But also, fuck India. What a terrible place Sorry I don't have any condoms I agree religion shouldn't be a thing, but you're pushing your own beliefs onto others, saying that what they believe in is dangerous and wrong so they should change to your way of thinking instead. Which is what most religions out there do right now. Just saying. so answer why and how we exist? for what reason People like this act as though religion is the root of all evil. Even religion didn't exist, we'd still fight and kill each other over race, sex, politics, sexuality, and money. 

But sure, act as though we'd be a perfect society if it weren't for one thing. Happy 14th birthday! I mean technically Buddhism is fine with atheism but go off. If it were not for various religions, people as a whole would have difficulty grasping concepts larger than their own life. If your life is being ruined by someone's interpretation of a religion, blame them, not the religion. Ok 😐 Ok I don’t know OP sounds a little closed minded to me. Not advocating for blind faith without critical analysis. Just saying, sometimes there’s valuable information in things we don’t agree with or that don’t sit comfortably with us. edgy I'm amused that this is labeled as politics.

No it fucking isn't. Religion is fiction. Ironic. If there is no God, why does anything you've said even matter? By who's definition is any of it wrong or evil? I’m not up for extremism or violence through religion, but the amount of nihilism resonating from this post is way too much. You can’t lump all the followers with the ones who want to bring about viol and suffering Relax... You seem like a big fan of Ash Wednesday yes sir im on it Nah people are just terrible you don’t need a religion to do that That’s a nice belief you have.. Yo lmfao Religion is not the only things that divides us. So many other things like the color of our skin, sexuality, politics etc. Insults are never the way to convert people. That’s fine we are living in a simulation, so maybe after we “die” on Earth we’ll go to simulated heaven and see all our loved ones. You anti-religion people need to move on to simulation and higher powers in the universe - not a religious god - a higher evolved power that makes us look like amoeba. I don't believe in any God but I respect the people who believe and have faith in supernatural powers. I know you want to say something good but you just sound like a toxic atheist that thinks that everyone who believe in higher powers are stupid. And religion in a lot of cases try to help people, christianism has some teachings, like helping the poor or to not judge others. I think that if people are happy thinking in a way no one should try to force their own beliefs into that person, you believe that there is no God, then be happy with it but don't try to shame others for their religions. Science has given us comfortability and quality of living. It has not given us happiness. 

Religion, the realization and renunciation of the transient nature of our physical enjoyments will give us happiness. 

It is no religion that takes from others, wants to change others, and hate others. There is no religion in blind faith. If it does not lead to love and charity it is not religion. 

There are many organizations across the world that are sincere. Get to know these religions, not the humans who have perverted them. For starters, many Sikhs are beautiful. And I'd love to see you test your atheistic mettle against the Swamis of the Order of Ramakrishna. Some people are religious because of the off chance there is a god, and the eternity in heaven is worth being religious for. If there is a god, I’d be willing to tell him straight up to his face with no guilt, how shit a job he’s doing and that he should be ashamed of himself ! I am of the opinion that religion is a means to control the masses Fuck all atheists who claim to know the answers to the universe. 

You are nothing more than claiming to be a secular prophet who “knows the truth of the universe”. Fuck outta here with your bullshit. Ah, Indian just like American, just pretending that the bad religious people you see on your street reflect all religious people worldwide, while it is just in specific countries where religious become violent. Imagine you are living in a world where no religious person ever had influence on your life and you have never ever seen any criminal or anti social act done by a religious person in the name of his religion. Guess what: I don't hate religion. You know who I hate? People who do wrong, no matter if they are religious or not.

I am atheist, but my mother is not, but she doesn't believe in any religious bullshit, she is just a normal person who is by herself sure that there is a god, but she never wanted anything from me cause of that or others. Every time I see those hate posts about religions, I think about my mother, and question why people would wanna hate her? She is the most loving and caring person I ever met in my life, and my friends and visitors i get all approve that, especially her food ;). Can you imagine how that feel if someone says what your mother does is bad, although it isn't? That is the key problem here, you are saying ALL religion, while you should be angry about the ACTIONS, hating religions means that you are not particular being angry about the ACTIONS that they have done to you, it means that you hate EVERYBODY of them, it means that you hate those WHO NEVER had harmed anybody, who never had imposed their religion on others.

You say to fuck a group of people where there are a majority who have never done anything wrong. And now those people can use that as argument against you, cause you are not particular pointing those things out that are missing in your country WHICH EXIST IN OTHER COUNTRIES, like CLEAR splitting of religion and government. You have practical no idea how life is in a country with splitting of religion and government, AND STILL, you want to hate _ALL RELIGION_, which means you are also hate those people here in Germany who follow a religion that never influenced their life or the life of others. This is despicable and actually helps those people who are really wrong, who abuse religion to get into power who abuse religion to stay in power, cause they just can point to the harmless people an d say ""Why you hate those?""

You are literally hating people for the actions of others, which is the same as racist do. You are like a racist cause you are not pointing to those who did wrong, you point to ALL and say they are all wrong, cause of the actions of other people. All this hate in the world is just disgusting. Be ashamed, inform yourself about the world, and start liking the good parts and pointing to the bad parts, and not point to parts which are used for good and bad in the world just because you are too stupid to open your eyes.

I also want to point out: Isn't it funny how you describe how people should be living together and reflect in those sentences the way religion is used in modern civilization, in those countries which split religion from government. It is kinda disturbing that you have no idea how the world rotates and believe everybody is living in a shithole where religious people take action in the society. Just disturbing and totally stupid to fire up broadsword against people you do not even know, you have no experience with, you just know those in your shithole, but want to condemn those in other countries without even knowing how they are doing in other countries.

I hope you get the hate you spread. Fuck you. It's like blaming on the gun and not the shooter. People (most of them) follow religions as a discipline. However, there are some those who create division and unrest. Best thing is to avoid them. How the fuk do you know pal ? I don’t think religion is the problem, it is humanity that is messed up. Getting mad at religion can be easy, but if you want to be more accurate the issue lies a mother step wider, namely our tribalistic tendencies and power struggles. It just so happens that religion is one form that had been more visible, but more recently blaming religion just sounds like going backwards into more tribalism which is the real issue. Intriguing!! In this entire barb, it is about ""you"" and ""your"". 
Bro, are you the next enlightened one, lookout for followers??
Anyhow, for the rest, this video should be helpful:

[Why religious beliefs are not silly?](https://youtu.be/pLj4iwa0__8) You dont know anything son! Let people believe what they want to believe. Atheism are for the weak, lazy and nihilism that wants to justify their depression, hatred for life, antinatalism and laziness on the fact that we don\`t matter, we are just matter and that nothing matters. It is the coward way to rationalize one's own failure. Wants proof? Atheists have the highest suicide rate than any religious group by far. Failing to coping with depression leads to atheism. It is short-sighted to be so sure in what happens beyond death. We know nothing of our consciousness and it's impossible to say what happens when we die. I am against all religions, but the way that you are so sure of something that science knows nothing about comes close to just another form of religion to me. Agnosticism might be a better way. *claps in american* Fuck India Try some dmt.

You'll eat your views on what you think ""the big picture"" is.

All in all, your view that there's nothing else out there, is just as arrogant and ""silly"" as all those organized religions put together.

It's comical, the irony... Fuckkkk religion they should all burn anyways. A very uninformed understanding of what religion is, although I agree with and empathize with all of your sentiments. Thank you for this! Couldn't agree more

The only reason I can think of for believing in religion is hope. (Old people and the fear of dying, drug addicts that need something to hold onto or people that have had a bad time) Religion is the main cause of unrest worldwide*

Fixed Man, your life truly sounds like it sucks. If someone believes in something and it gives them a better quality of life, then fuck you for saying they can’t. You suck. >Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism.

Thank God I'm a Pagan I'm definitely not religious, but we should let people believe in what they want. Maybe the reason they hold on to their beliefs is because they are scared of dying or it makes them feel safe, cause fuck man death is scary. I know people say they aren't afraid of death, but I find that to be bullshit because I bet when you are sitting right in front of death then we will all be shitting our pants. 

I definitely don't agree with religious people who push their beliefs on us, but it doesn't mean I should tell them their beliefs are dumb because it's what comforts them. I mean who are we to take others comfort and safety away. 

Religion can be evil if used by the wrong people, but for many they only use it to do better. 

Also, if we are all insignificant in the grand scheme of things then why give a fuck about anything at all especially something like religion. Just let people live their lives and do your own thing. Hahaha, what a sad edge-lord. I’ll pray for you even though you’re one of those radical atheists who are as equally stupid as their radically religious counterparts.

Atheists are always full of themselves claiming an open mind and being woke, when really they are just as oblivious. You’re pathetic at the moment, but hopefully you will find some clarity soon.

You can learn from anything. It really isn’t a big deal. People mostly do it because of the chance that there is god. If there isn’t then oh well. r/copypasta What a bunch of terrible and hateful logic by a young teen, people are actually at their most evil without religion, recourse, or law. 150+ million dead to atheistic ideologies by Pol Pot, Stalin, and Mao. Edgy. Cool to know you hold all the answers of the universe. It’s ok to have faith. It’s ok to be afraid of death. It’s ok to congregate with your community. It’s ok to celebrate your culture. It’s religion and it’s rules and outdated beliefs that you do not need. Fuck Reditism Atheists are weak willed people and immoral people that thinks that just because the universe is big it means sentient life doesn't matter. Atheism is the first step to sociopathy and later to psychopathy. I am glad i saw the light and converted from atheism to christianity some time ago Religion, much like various cultures, are constructed based on the reigning norms and values of that society. However much like various cultures, they eventually obscelesse. I just hope the whole world one day will say this Calm down, my friend. Technically being atheist is also a religiou Breaking news as /r/India suddenly becomes /r/atheism from 10 years ago Yeah, I remember when I was 14 Lmao if I said that my parents they would whoop my ass, I somewhat do agree with you tho. I agree but also believe that money is a big contributor to what's holding back humanity. Because it creates greed. If we could just worked together as one people we could contribute so much more to the world and the future of humanity as a whole. You should join my cult. You know what I figured out? Gods are that imaginary friend you need support from when you're going through hard times. 
That's it. The whole thing is based around this Says the curry eater It’s been about a decade since I’ve become non-religious, but this type of stuff gets on my nerves. You explain how little value human life has and proceed to make the argument that religion has ended countless lives. I promise you, we are just as clueless, our actions just as arbitrary, and our minds are just as closed, if not more, than the most religious people on Earth. Sir this is a Wendy’s


(also what’s up with reddit and religion hating neck beards?) You can't force someone to leave their religion. I see a lot of anger in your post. You say God is not real. I understand where you're coming from. A lot of people use religion as justification or reasons for doing something or not doing something. The real answer is this: life is empty and meaningless. Does this mean God isn't in your life? Maybe. Religion doesn't start violence. Interpretation of religion does.

You say with full conviction that there is nothing after death.

Have you ever died before???

What you wrote is just your opinion not fact and a total bulshit.

Read Bible, Kuran, Gita. Hopefully, it will open your mind. [removed] There’s really nothing wrong with Buddhism, They don’t even believe in a god, it’s a nice religion( more of just a way of life tho), it doesn’t really belong in this category with the others lol On which premise we base morality? Why not suicide and bring it all with you? >Awww so badass
Abe Facebook pe post kar na dum hai toh lmao

.


>He got gold, silver and all that too
He's preaching to people who already do that

>That's like me telling you not follow modi
If he was discussing religion like we do then it would have been okay.


>But preaching to them ki ""fuck your religion""

Ye sab aap apne relatives se boliye na If you think the religionists have fucked up the most, wait till you read what the godless (read communists) have heaped on the world. At the end of the day, humans are bad for humanity. The conventional wisdom of bad vs good and evil vs good are blase. The politics of religion (or its absence) is the root cause of all these evils. Forget about religion, forget about spirituality, enjoy your moment under the sun as the only continuum, then you are safe from all fears and fearmongering. I would argue that religion is not what causes problems, stagnant civilizations, wars and murders. Bigotry is. People kill each other because of the unwillingness to accept that the other guy has just as much right to believe what they believe. Silence stagnates when people are unwilling to be open to new ideas. Cultures divide when we can't accept differences. Bigotry is not unique to religion. So I would argue, let's address the real enemy or else it will perpetuate even if all religions die off. Dude, you tell me to open your mind and ""come back to the real world"". Your real world sucks ass. It's a fallen world. This isn't the true world. It's apparent you need to open your mind. 

Also, isn't this an abuse of rule 3? This is literally hate mongering. WORD!!! Some people literally need religion because they have nothing else and wouldn't be able to cope with their reality otherwise. Well, you're going to be foaming out the mouth when you learn about Baha'i.

Not Indian, just saw this on r/popular, but: fuck you. Scapegoating is wrong. Very mature and elegant. wow you are so cool retard You make atheism sounds so twatish though. Not a coincidence that [most psychopaths are atheist](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/health/atheists-religion-study.amp.html) 

Keep your science fairy tale to yourself. Your weak theory (which is what it is, a theory) of the Big Bang is from a cult leader. But have yall ever tried DMT tho? Looks like somebody just finished reading Sapiens I was once an aethist, now agnostic. 
You cannot blame religion based on what people do. Want to know what Islam is? Read Quaran, want to know what Hindusim is? Read Vedas, Gita, and scriptures. Read Bible to know what Christianity preaches.
People are trash, they never go beyond their ignorance. 
Religion is not a set of rules, it's a lifestyle. Non religion preaches hate and bigotry. 
It's people who use religion as a weapon. 
As far as I have studied hinduism it goes way beyond life and death. From Ayurveda to astronomy from philosophy to physiology every aspect is covered regarding human life and death and beyond. We need to clear the fog. Religion is a set of rules and a moral compass to follow when you feel like you can't handle a situation alone. What you see on TV isnt religion. What you see people murder each other over isn't religion. It's sad and I hate it. Religion is something personal between you and the world we live in. You speak too much for a person who knows too little. /r/im14andthisisdeep Lol some kind of a fucking pathetic simp got mad when he lost a game of fortnite. Go fuck urself 14 yrs old kid I'm literally scrolling through Popular and came across this. Dafuq is going on in India? You can disagree but....damn dude, chill Fuck you. Cringe. Couldn't have said it better Imagine having.your wife burned because you.died before her Yea let people have their thing but leave me out of it.  I know but i don’t care. Fuck people who don't believe in a higher power. Amen! Hello from America, I feel the exact same way. Really no need to come at religion with you uninformed opinion because your insecure about yourself. Pledge your hearts to Satan my fellow heathens. If you think like that why even keep living? This post did not make me leave my religion. Islam teaches good manners, its brought me love and respect. Contentment without jealousy. Even if you don't believe in the afterlife (which you can't disprove either) the teachings alone are worth passing down. I think my favorite part is “nothing divides us expect religion” except ya know politics, cultures, personal beliefs on how to live, shall I go on this is a really poor argument on your part. Read The Law of One. ""Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.""

How do you know that's what happens? The old “I don’t agree so fuck you argument”. Why does crap like this get so many likes? Edgy and soypilled Raised in the church, left the church tne slowly re read the bible after a bunch of philosophers (athiests) quoted certain bits.   


Certainly dont think its all great but many good tales and lessons in there with god excluded. & i would add suicide rates are much higher amongst athiest communities than not. You forgot to fuck judism. Edit ur post. Buddhism actually isnt a religion. Side note it’s been conferred by scientist many times that theirs a grand being responsible for our creation on top of thousands of other arguments that just completely invalidates you argument, better luck next time.  The only reason I can think of for believing in religion is hope. very reddit of you Ok mr athiest r/im14andthisisdeep I'm waiting for this to become a copypasta. Let me remind you that Zionism was founded by an atheist ((Theodor Herzl) and this same ideology uses religion in many context to justify its relevance! Spare us your BS and start advocating for atheism when atheists come up with something constructive, not an ideology that created the most twisted society and an apartheid entity! 

Your use of science to promote atheism is just but a trick to give your idea some credibility! It works with some but not with all! Let’s go Judaism >Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species.

WHITE POWER! My biggest problem with religion is how so many of them clearly push the message across that we are all equal/treat others how you wish to be treated. But the majority case is, we are all equal, unless you're a woman, non-hetrosexual, from a foreign country or believe in a different religion. Religion is the main cause for division in the world, Christians hating muslims, jews fighting islamics, and so much more. On top of this the catholic and Christian churchs(maybe others too?) have been massive door stops in the evolution of scientific research. I support the peace religion tries to express, but the methods are far too skewed. Fuck buddhism ?

For what ? I'm an occultist Wow very well written and I couldn’t have said it better myself! It makes me angry that I’m in my 20s and my mom still tries to force religion on me saying that I got the good job I have now because of god...no mother I got it because of ME because I worked hard and got it.  Stop giving god all the credit and understand I made it happen.  The way she talks about god and religion would shock you.  Its as if she’s convinced everything in the Bible is the truth and she even said no one’s going to convince her otherwise.  But it’s sad because she’s been abused by different people nearly her whole life, doesn’t like where she is now and that’s why she needs to hold on to religion.  She just wants somewhere to belong and to hold onto.  I just can’t wait until the day we all die and realize there’s nothing.  I wish I’d be able to see the look on her face. Imagine thinking you know anything The word religion. There are so many interpretations of that word. There is the Catholic religion, the Christian, the Protestant and the innumerable divisions of Protestantism, and there is Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhs and so on. So many religions in the world, organised, some are brutal, the Islamic world and so on. So what do you consider is religion, the word? Is it the search for human beings something outside of their own daily life, something other than their petty self-centred activity, beyond their cruelty, bestiality and their vulgarity and all the rest of that? Is it that human beings have always sought from the most ancient of times something beyond themselves? If we consider that, something beyond themselves, beyond their daily life, then that becomes a religion of escape, which probably most religions are, as they are now. It is not connected with their daily existence. It is based on belief, on a book, or on faith, or on some dogma, rituals, the repetition of daily rituals which goes on practically all over the world - incense, dressing up, fancy dress and all that. All that, prayer included, is called leading a religious life, going, as they do in India at one time three times a day to the temple, and the Islamic world five times prayer, and the Sunday mass and so on. So this is considered religious, or rather a religious attitude. We are questioning that.

I would like rather to question the whole nature and the structure of present day religion. There are so many sects. They have found that Christianity is very limited, so they go off to Buddhism, or to some kind of sectarian gurus and so on, the multiplication of this search for something other than the daily boredom, daily loneliness, the constant conflict and so on. This has been the pattern. - Jiddu Krishnamurti 


https://jkrishnamurti.org/content/what-religion-you/Religion%20 Amen! God isn’t your imaginary friend, he’s your imaginary enemy.

An Imaginary Friend is a friend who will listen to your troubles, and are the only kind of friends I have. Oh, it wouldn't feel like r/popular if there wasn't at least one post bashing on religion. I’ve noticed most non religious or anti religious people I’ve met have one thing in common: they are not okay with the idea of having no control of their lives. They want to have full control and refuse to give that up. 

But we don’t... and that’s just how life is. God (or whoever/whatever you believe in) forbid you or I or anyone experiences the loss of someone and we really can’t do much to ABSOLUTELY avoid Or prevent it. 

We have to think more positively. You don’t have to believe, but you can at least respect the fact that others do. 

We can’t control what happens in life, but we are given full control of how to react to it. I wish I could upvote this 5000 times! Seems to me like you speak the language of your colonizers. Look deeper, think deeper. When did these problems begin? Don’t look for scapegoats. What messed you up isn’t religion, it is an agenda that was put in place before you ever graced this planet. Religion can bring good of it is used properly, look at Martin Luther King Junior or Malcolm X. Faith gave strength to people long before you, but you spout what your colonizers brainwashed you with. Wake up. Don’t think you are better than anyone else or that you have it all figured out. Atheism is also a religion, don’t delude yourself, because you read a few books or watched some TedTalks meant to influence people into leaving their creed and the only thing that comforts them. It is the settler/colonial system that makes us hate one another, because it’s easier to divide us to conquer us. k Like it or not, freedom of speech and freedom of thought is a double edged sword. I understand where your frustration stems from. I want to rid this country of divisive thoughts as much as you do. But we have to be better than them. We cannot speak in the same tone as they do. We have to stand up for our rights and rights of people that we don't agree with. That is the price of democracy. imo religion has always been a 'law' of sorts to govern the poor and uneducated back when it was established. 

I don't mind ppl who feel the need to find a belief or escape. it becomes a problem when it's an obsession, or wrong interpretation of the overall meanings or forcing an interpretation onto others. 

religion should not be more than 10% of your life. Ok mom Interesting... ""Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism."" but you failed to mention Judaism... Seems like just an advertisement for another sub. Some of you guys make religion sound like the root of all evil, while terrible things have been done in the name of religion in the past there are plenty of good religious people who have helped society in a literally uncountable amount of ways lol the sun won't blow into a super nova. Religion was more powerful in the past. It's more about money now. Wealth is the divider these days. Humanism is it’s own religion. Buddhism is not a religion As if humans needed Religion to commit atrocity in the name of a ""cause""...for all your scientific theory you seem to understand very little about human nature.

Religion isn't the ""cause"" of anything it's a *tool* occasionally used by w/e ""powers"" as a convienent form of manipulation based in fear. Religion is factually nothing but a set of beliefs...general beliefs can and do exist outside of such constructions & would easily take it's place manifest in some other form.

I'm not religious but this seems (objectively) to be little more than an emotionally rooted kneejerk to pin the tail on a target for some personal pain. There is no god and I am his prophet right? In the name of religion a lot of people were killed agreed.

The epitome of scientific advancement contributed by the best scientists of the time, led to the invention of Nuclear weapons that killed a lot too.

So now are you going to say science is bad because people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were killed? No, you would tell , science was used for the wrong purpose.

Same way, it's simple. When religion is used for wrong reasons, wrong things can happen.

Beautiful communities are formed through religion too, there is unity too.. it's not always fight between religions or for a religion.

My opinion is we should look at a bigger picture and be more considerate.

Have a good day. “Fuck Buddhism”

“You are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is bigger than you could fathom”

[???](https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/46407983/Nick-Young) question, what drives your morality if you believe all will be dust in the end? Religion and it’s values, belief and fear in a higher power are what have brought society to where it is today. I’m non religious myself but you sound like an angsty teenager who thinks he’s found the solution to world peace. Spoiler alert, it’s not that simple and you’re not that smart or original for thinking it All religion will fuck you in return. People believe because idea of life being just this and that we are only one responsible for what we are doing scare the shit out of them. They rather believe in higher plan and some almighty overseer. I remember when I was 12. Weeb Wow so euphoric. Well to be fair buddhism isn't really a religion... It's really about just being more in tune with yourself and your community. It's more of a philosophy like taoism or confucianism. Edgy Fuck all religion. All hail economic ideologies 100% Cool story bro. So edgy. Religion isn’t bad *per se*. It’s been a thing since the primitive man was thinking. Modern religion is not the same as it was in the beginning; it was a way to ascend man to a cosmic level, to live forever, and many more things. Nowadays it’s just a vestige of that, stopping progress and shit. 
I would not call them “childish beliefs”, true religion is a beautiful and interesting thing as seen from a anthropological and psychological perspective. 

Religion as economics and imposition is another thing. >A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa.

No. The fossil record has been updated more than once.

https://www.natureasia.com/en/nmiddleeast/article/10.1038/nmiddleeast.2018.15 Religion does suck. I don't believe in ""God"" but I don't hate on others for it. Live and let live type of thing. When it encroaches on my space I make it very clear that I would like no part of it. Mainly because nobody knows and therefore they are talking out of their ass. Hoes mad Let people believe what they want, if they’re not hurting anyone then why does it matter? This is exactly why I detest atheists. I don’t have a religion, I follow my own belief. But by far this absolutely harsh ideology is forcing your own beliefs just as others forced theirs on you. It makes you no better than them, and to be honest everyone needs to understand it’s not okay to force your beliefs on others.

That’s all that needed to be said, not this rant that slams and insults people that have done nothing to you. I can counter argue that those in some religions would likely have a less brute force approach and not be so callous and reckless with their words. Words hurt others, words start wars, words are like the bullets that provide ammo for evil and tyrannical agendas. 

Take a step back and realize you have no control, this shout into the void is useless. You’re doing it for comfort or recognition which is only temporary in the grand scheme of things. Applause fades, the curtains close, and you’re left standing there feeling good about yourself for the wrong reasons. 

The best way to detest religion is not to recognize them at all or give the energy you have up in an attempt to put them “on blast” so to speak. You don’t believe, good for you, many others are like you. But just because you don’t believe doesn’t mean others CAN’T believe. Stop trying to cause a stir in such a rude and disrespectful way out in the open and instead find a way to put that energy into something that will actually make a difference.


Have a great day. I think you got the date wrong about when we left Africa Good on you for you opinion. I'm no motherfucking devout religious sanyasi but hey atleast I don't write conceited posts shitting on other people's beliefs. Everyone's opinion is just as valid as yours. You're an atheist? Great. Good on you. Some people are Christians, some Hindus. Good on them too. Having different opinions doesn't make you superior to anyone. Fuck buddhism? I have always believed and always will that humans are meant to work together and the only legacy that matters is the one where you've ensured some kind of positive change for the future of our species. If nothing matters and we’re all going to die anyway who cares if some people are religious. shut up cracker You are free to believe or not believe in whatever you want, but this is such a boiled down to nothing take. You act like being a good Samaritan and advancing society is not possible while being religious, which is super dumb. You arent that smart for throwing out human history and the way u frame it makes you sound like a 13 year old white kid who doesnt have a lot to offer besides condescending snide comments; that and you come off as zelous and insane as the preachers and religious leaders of older times that ostracised and killed others for following their own practice( in your case lack of practice). Again you are free to put your time and faith in anything u want, religion or science, but you make non religious science praising athiests sound real dumb. Could use with a touch of less unnecessary nihilism and a ""nothing matters i a cog in the machine of the universe"" air to your ideas, cuz you are defintely not keeping an open mind. Based Live and let live. That is why we has this beautiful thing called freedom of religion in America. If someone's beliefs do not directly impact you, live at peace with them. Just as vehement as you are atheist, there are the same who are religious. You are not entitled to be right just because you are upset that people think differently. Grow up, and realize that people have the right to believe what they want, despite how upset it makes you. You are not preaching love, you are preaching hate of people who view the world differently. We are not all the same (genetics will tell you that). Religion is the real world, as it is ingrained within cultures throughout the world. People have believed in a creator for thousands of years. If it makes you feel better to be an atheist, more power to you. But do not tell me (or anyone else) how to live their lives, because in effect, you are doing EXACTLY that which you are criticizing. My 2 cents

I don't even know where to begin. Further more, I think that most don't realise the kind of argument you guys are putting forth.

I kinda understand where this thought begins but tbh it is just as good as any other scapegoat. We are so desperate to find a solution out of the misery and problems we are surrounded by that we make another scapegoat. The way in which responses are written in this thread shows the other bitter side of the coin.

From a completely neutral point of view, advocating for the removal of religion is as radical of an idea as some religion advocating for the banishment of the other religion (like what you see in the events unfolding). BUT wait... you could say, I as a non-religious ""unbiased person"" am seeking betterment for the society (I will overlook the way everyone on this thread places moral anchorage as if something like that even exists in this viewpoint - ""good and bad?"" What are those terms?), anyway, back to the point, you have done the same by placing yourself on a false pedestal dictating the terms and the way you present them as absolute.

So...

What is the true solution if you want to dismantle any , and I mean any false beliefs?
Simple - Engage in discussion and do not throw some belief out of the window or portray it as radical just because you don't like it. This way, we can have a society that actually progresses by engaging with the other and not by ""marginalising"" the other. Calling our groups to hate and laugh on the ideas of the other can also not lead to a harmonious society. Remember, you can come to similar terms on many issues by talking and listening to the other with an intent to understand

PEACE and I'm out Bruh for an ideology that doesn't belive in something they sure also hate it a lot. Nice opinion bruh. Don’t forget the most common modern religion to take over; Scientism. People think science will save humanity as much as a Omnipotent being will. You could easily replace the views of former generations of “don’t worry god will save us” with the modern view of “don’t worry science will save us”. Most people don’t realize the concepts are exactly the same. Also the same as UFO believers. “Don’t worry aliens will save us”. 

We’ve not grown spiritually at all in the last 1k years and I would argue we have digressed. You can see even you the op have your bias toward science in your post. Belief in science can be just as dangerous and honestly are exactly the same as belief in religion.

There’s nothing wrong with any of the views to be honest though. You don’t really hate religion, as they all serve a purpose. You hate peoples need to push their views on others and the childish behavior of always having to be right no matter the logic. Fuck that immature view instead! Well said. Show me on this teddy bear where the priest touched you Hey i hate religion and think it should be totally abolished. But you don’t know what happens when we die and it’s annoying when atheists say shit like “you know happens when we die, we just black out and that’s it”.

Yes we know what will happen to your body but no one knows what does it could happen when we die. It’s the one question we may or may never get answered. I'm not a believer myself, but shitting on someone else's belief is not cool man, not cool. You think you sound reasonable, but your tone mirrors that of an extremist in a religious sect. Sounds like a budding daoist to me. For all we have is reality, cast aside everything but reality. This is what I believe in!! I absolutely despise religious beliefs for the sole reason that in a country like India , in today's time, people go around wearing this tag of ' I am a ___' and ask others about their religious beliefs...and like in my family being atheist is like being arrogant like wtf?! My mom is a hardcore religious person and I am a hardcore atheist Bec of all the madness that goes around in the house under the name of this so called fucked up religion. 
I believe in Energy that thrives in the universe and of course KARMA ;-) Lol yo chill Fuck religion. Nice post Most religions that exist today (100s of them) don't even believe in the afterlife, so their point has nothing to do with death or immortality. Religions are made because the humans needed hope. The hope, that all of this has a meaning. They needed a guide how to behavior in life, to find peace in the death. But greed corrupted it, the humans themself did it, and if there is a god or more, humans wouldn‘t be able to life by their wills without corrupting it. Today, it‘s a tool to control the masses. But how do you know that you blackout and cease to exist after death? Calling all religion childish for what they believe of the afterlife and then imposing you know exactly what happens after death is arrogance. You're no better than the very thing you're complaining about.

Ultimately no one knows what happens after death and no one will ever be able to know until you die yourself. So what's wrong with hoping for something peaceful, especially when the entire concept of non existence is an unknown and scary thought to the vast majority. A good friend of mine who I care for has anxiety attacks from just thinking of this concept of unending blackness of nothingness. So what's wrong with finding peace in thinking of something different?

Personally I'm agnostic. Because theres no way to know, I dont think its logical to claim anything with certainty solely based off what anyone believes is true. But I dont think theres anything wrong with hoping for peace in the afterlife especially if it gives you peace of mind while you're alive.

Edit: After reading through the rest of your post I agree with mostly everything else, but i still dont think it's right to generalize religion like that. I agree the extreme side of religion is bad. There is a problem with anything when it turns into tribalism. Or when it makes people ignorant and unable to live in reality. But if people are keeping to themselves and helping others find peace in some way, then I see nothing wrong. Especially when there are a lot of good churches who help those in need with their personal problems, somewhat in the same way as therapy. Not only that but there are a lot of good messages that some churches preach, that dont necessarily even have anything to do with religion but are just simple messages of be a good person and love one another. Add caste to the list too.. That bullshit needed to be banished long ago... At this point it's more dangerous than a bad of heroin Post this on r/theydidthefuckyou What if I told you figuring out how to behave is way harder than knowing how from the start I am 31 and still recovering from the damage Christianity has done to me since I was a child.  One of the most unfortunate parts of religion is that it allows people to not take responsibility for the bad AND the good things that happen in life. It becomes a problem when you attribute all of your successful decisions in life as “the hand of god” because you never quite feel powerful enough to reach your fullest potential and happy self.   Like you couldn’t possibly have done well without help from some external force that’s smarter and braver than you.  They literally take children, break down their self esteem and make it so that the only people who can understand you are the other people in their loony bin called the church.  I once told my mother that using religion to raise your children is cowardly and lazy.  She didn’t take that very well.  
        When you get out of religion like I did, initially you are free and relieved. But then you struggle immensely dealing with reality.  No one ever taught you how to deal with your emotions properly and it takes a long time to appreciate living in doubt and uncertainty.  You spent all of your important developing years being brainwashed.   Religion is fucking evil.  It is for the weak and mentally ill.  Don’t let anyone tell you any differently. hey fuck you too As an atheist I agree with much of what you have written, though your grammar needs a bit of work. 
But many of your statements are inaccurate: just because some aspects of this life and death are unknown at this time does not mean we will not discover their underlying truths in the future.
However, your self-righteous attitude is not one that will succeed. Calling to religious believers' attention the myriad wrongs of religion will not convince them to seriously consider your argument.
And why should they?
Please think about this: most humans who have lived, or are now living, have an overriding goal in life to live as long and as happily as possible. 
So there you stand on a street corner waiting for the walk signal with an elderly person. When the two of you begin to cross the street, are you going to take away your fellow traveler's crutches and state they should not be used because you don't need them?
Though certainly far from perfect, religion helps millions of good people get along in this world. Who are we to deny them their peaceful and often kind and thoughtful way of living? 100 % agree. why do u guys send unwanted dick pics to everyone Copypasta Trump visits India.

Reddit: fUcK iNdIa AnD yOuR rElIgIoN! I use to believe exactly the same shit you do...use to...and now that I know the truth, I feel bad for you I don't believe in religion but everyone believes in something.
Some believe in money, some believe in science and some in religion.
The issue is not in believing something but imposing your beliefs on others. The expectation that everyone around you should believe in the same thing is what's causing the unrest in India. AND FUCK ATHEISM. Just live and let live. Wow! You have it all figured out. You should write about your wisdom, share it and gather followers. Temper temper. Religion or not, man is evil, does evil. Sure, people are good and do good too but left unchecked, without the God(s), Man will revert to bestiality. The common law and government only work when everybody buys into it.  Which is why we need schools, to ensure everybody buys into it from an early age.

Otherwise the idea that one can own property is meaningless fiction. But we strive toward that fiction and it is the basis for our society. More property, more status, more wealth, more police to safeguard it, more military to ensure outsiders don't claim it, and more religion to propagate the myth that God wants this.

But whether there is a God or not, whether it cares or not, is up for debate. What is not is that people left unchecked will always result in them exploiting others in whatever form s/he can for their own benefit. God, as we commonly imagine, possibly is an Alien. Wow.  Breakin new ground there..... Ok streetshitter Cringe atheist Gonna cut yourself on all that edge u/koalakitty84 Ok I don’t believe in religion. But I believe there were civilization on our planet about 12-15k years ago. We were advanced enough to build pyramids and many other megalithic things. 

We were a global civilization, but some natural disaster happened. 90% of the population got wiped out. We started from ground zero being cave man again. All the amazing technology became stories, and stores became legends and some became religions today The first perpetrator of religion has blood of millions soaked in his hands. Dude. I say this shit all the time. It’s all made up bullshit. Except I don’t get a thousand rewards for it. > Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.


My only serious question for you is this:

How do you know? Preach man I strongly disagree, but respect your right to hold that opinion; and see no reason why we couldn’t get along. 

See? We’re not so bad :p 100% agree edgy teenager alert H.P. Lovecraft's entire horror is based on the idea that human existence is insignificant. Why do atheists love to trot this idea out like its a good thing? Not sure if religion is bad in its entirety.But, what I'm sure about is that it's being misused for gains. That's the real issue. Education might be one of the potent solutions. Christian here, I have a couple of questions.

Why does religion mean close minded?

Why does religion mean evil?

You say that after we die nothing happens. Have you experienced death before to back up your claim? Just because a religion is responsible for a war doesn't mean all religious people deserve to be hated. How can you be so sure there is no afterlife when you haven't experienced death yourself?

Don't get me wrong, I believe the same as you, but you can't just say you're right just because you think it is the most logical answer. All I see when I read this is arrogance and nonacceptance of a societal norm that isn't going to go away if you insult it. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  said :

“If religion becomes a cause of dislike, hatred and division, it were better to be without it, and to withdraw from such a religion would be a truly religious act”. Angry Redditor is angry at religion. Then again what do you know? Fuck nationalism! This dude would be in nazi germany and say fuck you to the jews Damn, I'm an Atheist but let people believe in what they want bro. Sounds like OP read the book 'Sapiens' You couldn’t be more right. I agree but Buddhism shouldn’t be grouped with any of those. Especially Abraham if religions. Buddhism is more of a mindset than a religion. I trust in God. Still. Hey, if you are feeling this way reach out to like minded people. You'll feel just slightly better I promise. > [DISCOVER YOUR TRUE IDENTITY](https://youtu.be/Rf3HR6bAd4Y)

[Be like 🦋](https://youtu.be/crPfz52a32c), [fly with both wings](https://youtu.be/7zY9A28YmFE). People should be able to believe what they want. Insulting one’s religion could be in equivalence to insulting one’s political opinion. Some people pursue religion to seek a purpose in life. Others interpret their religion’s scriptures wrong and it stains the reputation of these religions. Preach Buddhism doesn’t really have a concept of life after death, at least not at its core. I have this exact same mind set, I fucking detest religion it has been the source of most wars, murders, rapes and tortures. It has been the source of corruption and inequality I mean “Divine Right of Kings” anybody?

It’s still a fucking source of those things now! 

I let people do what they want, because realistically I can’t stop people doing what they want. But it’s sad that some people are utterly brainwashed and pressured by families and communities and it’s awful seeing the way religion dictates how you should live your life. 

There is no ultimate goal in this universe, no watchful god to tell us our destiny it’s just ramblings in books. We have no purpose, we have to make our own purpose in life for what little time we have and I think religion greatly hinders that. Another reason reason why I hate it. It's not religion, it's ideas. Communism and other political idealogies are responsible for more deaths than religion. No matter what people believe about the afterlife and the divine, they will always find a reason to kill each other Ugh, rubbish post I fucked Religion before a year and I am happy now George said it best.

https://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE Who hurt you? You know you can not believe in the organization of any religion but still be a moral & ethical person as an individual... right? 

You can inspire others to do right on a spiritual level by setting a good example. Leader or show others what you think/believe is the best way to live life and exist. 

However, what business is it of yours if others use their own spirituality or religion to give themselves hope or to have faith... a motivation or purpose for their own existence.  

Spirituality & Faith regardless of a specific religion can, in certain individual cases, be a lifestyle someone of their own free will chooses to just get by and live as best they can.  

Why leave any faith and ""come back to the real world"" if someone's faith and spirituality is their own personal motivation for being a good person, and just being good in general. 

In my personal point of view maybe you should calm down and think about what you wrote down. We are not all the same and we all can be divided by anything not just religion. Are you going to use someone's religion as a way to scapegoat and discriminate against someone as an individual just because of their religion? 

Learning and Science is important and crucial to humanity as a whole but so are moral, ethics, and basic human decency... how can this be learned if not by example. Judge someone as an individual by getting to know them & not just making blanket assumptions based on something so superficial as what religion an individual chooses to believe in. 

Maybe open your own mind and try considering life from another perspective. What if peoples' rights to believe & worship as they choose is taken away for absolutely everyone one day... and science and logic are the only options. In World War 2 the Nazis did this. Now, I.S.S.L  is also trying this as well. 

Do the phrases ""Never Again"" and ""Those who don't learn from the mistakes of history are bound to repeat those same mistakes"" are either ones you've heard before? This is not helpful. The zeal of atheism adds, in the eyes of the religious, yet another religious perspective...namely that there is no religion. 

Yes, world conflict can be caused by religion. But banishing it all together isn't going to solve anything.

In the secularized West, politics took the place of religion and we can see the effects of that in America. 

Religion or not, there will always be human conflict. It is the nature of our condition. Might I suggest sir. Why I am an atheist by Bhagat Singh. I'm guessing you dont like the pope huh? Religions are cults with a lot of money Nah it's not religion that causes problems, it's people's fucked up agendas and desires that get in the way Man, what did Buddhism do to deserve its spot on your shit list? the problem is people people will always be shitty in an area you find them in Lord Almighty, as I pray today for those that do not know Jesus I ask that You can break whatever it is that has control over their heart that takes them away from knowing You. Psalm 119:67 says, “Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey your word.” It is true that many have to fall to their lowest points in life before they turn their life over to You. It often takes painful circumstances to drive us to Christ. Addiction, lust, materialism, and other deadly sins are false gods that are stealing the hearts of those who need You the most. I pray for those who are unsaved that You will be able to rip the bondage of what is holding them back. May they seek You! Amen. As people do we not also have the same right to believe in whatever we want, I am an atheist but I have nothing against religion only what most people believe religion entails... being religious does not mean that you have to go to church or spread your religion it is simply to have faith in something, this something does not have to be a god, it can also be an ideal. You should  be less concerned with believing religion is crap and more concerned with what *you* believe in, what *you* put you’re faith in. There is no need to separate yourself by what or who you are, what makes us who we are is our beliefs. do not separate yourself from everyone else because of this, that is what is wrong with the idea of religion in its current state. That does not mean, however, that believing in something is inconsequential, it could never be more the opposite. Amen to that. Reddit moment To believe in any religion in any capacity you have to actually be stupid. If there’s an afterlife we are in a simulation I believe its misinterpretation of religion/ religious texts, false beliefs and narrow mindset of people that causes unrest, rather than religion. 
The broad teachings of most religions uplift the moral values and teach people to live a peaceful life. Fuck you for flipping off my religion! Do you feel better now that you're done having a humiliating temper tantrum? My personal opinion: It is not a religion's fault that there is unrest in many religious countries. It is the fault of the people. They take extreme measures and start making up new rules that serve their goals in the name of the religion. A religion's purpose is to guide people through life and to it easier, but corrupted people have changed that concept. Thus, people will start hating their religion because its idea has been deformed. Nice Reddit moment Wow you’re so enlightened! And edgy too! Preach man You're beating a dead horse here dude. This should be on r/notliketheothergirls Yep yep yep Quit shitting in the streets. AMEN! Agree with the first paragraph, religion is retarded. But it's very possible there is an afterlife. Fuck all of India What drives people to act like this? We understand, you think sky man is bad, but you don’t have to be a complete asshole religion was meant to be proxy for law and order - however a lot of people were too soft in the head to make up their own minds about right and wrong and stuck to the teats of drug-addled story tellers. Then we gave these idiots the right to vote and the invitation to fuck up everything we worked so hard to create-medical aids,education, law and order. I don't think blaming the majority party playing on religious lines is of any use. These hate-filled people are our neighbors,colleagues and acquaintances and currently are ravishing every moment of delhi burning-it warms their heart . If you want to be of any use, remember till the very end who these people are and why they don't deserve an inch of space next to a human. See the contrast. Earth's most intelligent species- Humans creating all sorts of crazy stuff with science.
Also, humans believing their god created everything with some superpowers and that god can punish you and end your problems. Fuck you all, you stupid shits! Believe what you want but don't kill people if they disagree with you and don't brainwash people to join your beliefs. I agree with the reactionary sentiment but religion wasn't another hocus pocus idea coined out of nowhere by a selected group of evil people. Religion and God as a concept grew organically as we evolved, and anything that grows out of human nature and necessity isn't something to be discarded without second thought. Of course any high school student with a functioning brain can tell that most religious concepts are fictional and outright bullshit. But because something is not real doesn't make it invalid and irrelevant. Human nature like that of any animal on earth is filled with hate, violence and raw evil as abundantly as the good side of humanity. We are capable of things far far worse than what we are led to believe in this overly protected and privileged life that we lead. Without any rules for morality or shackling our need to present our shadow to the world, we would have destroyed ourselves long ago. Religion just happened to be the best model we have for working at this. Even as of now we haven't found any sustainable alternatives and most literature, from Jung to modern day psychologists, agrees with this. Yes it sucks that people believe in fairy tales and kill each other to defend their stories, but for now our civilization isn't grown enough to handle no religion on a global scale. As an atheist it makes me extremely sad but that's the way things are. As for the bright side of things, some stuff off top of my head. For now we can try distancing state and religion as much as we can, and elect law makers who support making policies for this cause. We can also try bettering our education system to develop empathy in children as they grow up. May be for starters not elect someone who's entire agenda was divisional politics from the beginning. We can work on initiatives in raising awareness and communal harmony. List goes on. > Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.
You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.
But, you are here in the now

Thats probably one of the best descriptions of BUDDHISM I've ever read :D Has anyone sat back and thought.
""Hey maybe because of the fact I'm so incredibly small in this vast infinite universe, maybe just maybe I have no fucking clue of the forces that exist beyond us and the grand scheme of things. People just because your a spec of sand in this universe doesn't mean you don't matter. It just means you can't possibly hope to grasp the gravity of events that are going on at least in this lifetime And with that fuck capitalism and the state too! Bravo. Couldn’t have said it better myself. I cannot fathom how people believe in religion or a god. I really hopes this opens more people eyes. Funny how you sound exactly like a crazy religious zealot but with the opposite message Thank God I’m atheist!! Amen :( Atheism is a Religion. It's ok. It's the time of shadows now. No need to shout it from the rooftops. yikes🟩 I'm praying for you, OP. It's said that those with a seared conscious will never fully understand the concept of God the same way others with a strong faith can. The Holy Spirit is within you, OP. You just have to keep searching and the answers will be revealed. But you dont know what happens after death so ur just saying ur rather agressive opinion No gods, no masters. What about sikhi Personally, I've come to hypothesize that religion was born to quench man's greed to take control over others and their wealth by invoking the fear of the *unknown*. In fact, the concept of a ""God"" itself seems to be a rather genius invention which allowed someone in the very early days to control other people and to set them do their deeds—a few good and *mostly* to crush their opposition. At some point soon after, more people wanted this power over the populace and started their own groups with their own gods and thus, religions were born.

It's my personal belief that one can unlock their true potentials by freeing themselves of the ridicules imposed by their religions and gods and work for the greater good of humanity. But I would also be at peace with people following their beliefs if it didn't lead to abhorrent violence like the one we're witnessing right now.

We don't stand to gain anything by repeating the mistakes of our ancestors and murdering each other. We only stand to gain by working towards the future collectively. Religion is a necessary part of humanity. It is something that brings out the best in some people, and the worst in others, but religion gives people purpose and meaning because it is hard to understand that one day you will just black out of existance. Atheist until the plane crashes Rick Sanchez is tired of your bullshit guys. Pakistani atheist here and WHOLE HEARTEDLY FUCKING AGREE I mostly agree with you. But the tone I am reading is making it sound like a religion lol. 
Fuck religion. But I don't think we should believe on humanity either. We all are stupid and one day we will all die because of our idiocy. Agreed. And we have alcoholics because of jesus/church. (Church made it ok to drink /get drunk). What baffles me is that we still have churches. That people still believe this BS.  How many versions of the bible are there.  How drunk was the guy writing it. The last people on earth to become atheist will be Jews.

Which is why they promote it to everyone else You have quite alot of time to write this popular opinion. Well, that's your belief. Praise jesus Religion was legit just invented by someone who wanted control How is something this close minded so highly upvoted? Yikes I believe that every person can believe what they want, just don't be forcing your views on others. That also goes the other way. don't like religion, no need to announce it, you're opinion isn't an airline flight. Dick. RELIGION POISONS EVERYTHING!!! 🤨 Tbh anybody that thinks they're so certain about what happens after death is just as naive as everyone else claiming they understand this shit. There is literally no proof for either side that there is something or that there is nothing after death, it's all man made speculation. Being a hardcore atheist is no different than being devout to any other faith because you're claiming to know and understand something you very much dont. Until we die, none of us are going to grasp death in a true sense, and any living person that thinks they ""know"" is just as arrogant as the next, regardless of what they claim is out there. Accept that none of us know a fucking thing about death other than the physical process and move on You are almost there... I still choose to follow my religion, but I respect your opinion. To me it's just so empty to live for nothing in the future... to have the present unfulfilling reality and after that, nothing. 

I fully believe in Christianity... But even for those who don't, isn't there something to be said for having hope in something? Especially for all those people who have nothing to live for? Religion gives us value. 

In Christianity specifically, we believe in a God who cares deeply for us and has given us a future after death. Our lives mean something and we have a purpose now, and that carries on after death. To just get rid of that would leave life so empty. 

Sure, we can spend our time making our lives better. Helping others, bettering our lives and the lives of our families. But if that's it, what's the point? 
It just seems like a shallow, empty way to live... I'm not religious, but I wish I was. I understand why people are religious, it gives purpose to their lives, and I have none. Still some people try to play No True Scotsman, but seriously, that changes absolutely nothing. If it's prone to get violent and has gotten violent multiple times then that also *is*  a potential part of its ""nature"". Better reduce it's radius to just personal preferences. 

And I don't understand why they see you as moral-less degenerate like a dark moist mossy corner untouched by light if they hear you're an atheist. Like, wth is even moral? If you need a book, teachings, blind belief, and a supposed sky daddy just to be nice to others (which you absolutely don't either and rather find a way to justify your wrongdoings) then I can claim myself to be more self dependant than you ever will be. Man should be owned by his own thinking, not enslaved by what he's made entitled to believe. End of story. This nigga really out here believing the only uncreated creation is humans and space dust and nothing came before them. Problem are the ""Hindu atheists"" who are liberal but conflicted and play both sides. They indirectly enable these fascists. 

And Hinduism==Hindutva. Religion did not come first, Politics did. Ganesha was a satanic deity in the purana but his followers gained political power and made him benevolent. Whoever wrote Puranas obviously hated those followers and made their god satanic. It was only the pan-Indian empires who needed secularism(smhartists) who wrote differently but most kingdoms were monotheistic(Shiavist, Vaishnavist etc.), as far apart as Sunni and Shia. Nothing like what it is today.

Think about it, who would name their son Duryodhan(originally Suryodan). That's like naming someone Alakshmi. Whichever dynasty Mahabharat is based on obviously demonised them. Victors have been making the ""truth"" forever. Hinduism is not a religion. It's a way of living. I agree on the bit about religion but you couldn’t be more wrong when it comes to the history of mankind and you shouldn’t portray like you do. I just read all that thinking the person typing it was in rage, screaming with a red face. Which he/she probably was lol TLDR 🥱 What an angry little child. I mean... you could just believe and follow a religion and not be a radical... The super atheist Bullshit, I just saw God on Supernatural yesterday.  Likes to be called Chuck. Well said! Brother!!!! very classy reddit Fuck you too lmao. Nobody gives a shit for your nihilism. Also is you think religion is inherently evil you're an idiot PREACH! stop crying 🤡 Belief is good when it's pure. It's bad now because violence apologists use religion as their sword. Religion bad please upvote I see your point but you are one angry person. Relax and let people live. People will come around on their own terms if they so choose. So little words, so many lies It’s funny how ignorant some people are Propaghandi Wow you couldn't be farther from the truth. Christianity has all those answers yet you choose not to consider them because of your lusts (this is not just referring to sexual lusts.) Take some time to actually study Christianity. I know you won't because you don't want there to be a God that can judge you. You want to do what you want thinking that will improve your life. If you only knew and saw the actual movement of God now a days you'd be surprised and then afraid of your eternal pathway you'll be on after death. Agzina saglik kardes It’s a scam to get you to waste your very real time on this earth for a promise of more time that doesn’t come. Just enjoy the time you have here and now, it’s finite. AGREE 100% “You do not matter... but matter itself is being part of this universe.”

That’s an oxymoron. You just said it. Under your worldview, we do not matter. In fact, under your worldview you can not tell me why murder is wrong, rape, etc. Because we are cells together to form consciousness. 

Your worldview is incoherent. Your worldview leads to nihilism and death. Your worldview is the childish one, sounding Incredibly arrogant and edgy. Your worldview is incompatible with reason itself. You cannot even use rationale without borrowing from the religious, because the laws of logic themselves are immaterial.

Grow up, learn that the world isn’t black and white and that every human is capable of great evil and is indeed evil, whether religious or atheist. Stop blaming others (religion) for your problems. Man up. Try to do good. And stop following a contradictory worldview that says life has purpose because it has no purpose. Euh atheist movements caused massive exterminations, think Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, wtf this is so stupid. What if I chose to believe in what I want. You chose to believe in or have a lack of belief in what you want. We respect each other’s decision and move on? I think the problem in India is not your religion. It's india Speaking of childish, this rant.  Are you 14 and this is deep?  Religion is the reason we know how to read, how do you know what happens after death?  Have you died?  The catholic church has massive amounts of hospitals and medical care.  So you believe that nothing became something for no reason?  How can you say what is good and evil?  Isnt is all relative if there is no transcendent truth?  Faith in a God of truth and lawfulness is the source of science.  This post seems like the temper tantrum of a small child. I mean, you kind of just explained Buddhism honestly I think religion does have its purposes. It’s gives people hope, teaches good morals, and attempts to scare those people into following those morals. Most of those morals are good, but it also backfires with a lot of hate like you said. Such as Christians and their hatred for lgbt etc. Those words are exactly what I think of humans and religion. each and every word! Oh look another atheist that just has to tell people he’s an atheist. You guys do more spreading your word than all religions combined. Fuckin’ amen!!! Dude chill.... Lol. sorry but low IQ people need some kind of behavioral philosophy to follow or they'll all rage against their existence. I am not particularly religious. I enjoy some of the stories and agree religion causes a lot of damage but it can be helpful to some e.g the lonley. Being part of a community is good. It sounds a bit like you think war etc would end if religion did but I dont think it wouldb there would still be greed etc. You dont really know what happens after death so you can't really expect people to accept your beliefs over thiers. This came out of nowhere Your post indicates that you don’t have a true understanding of Buddhism, and because of that I have to believe that you most likely have a misunderstanding of all religions. To me it seems like your post is one led by emotion rather than of fact. So with all this open mindedness and being insignificant. Why would leaving religion  behind matter? Seems like you put a lot of effort into what is ultimately meaningless.

Also, the 20th century when God was proclaimed dead has been the bloodiest century more so than the past 19 combined. Thanks for that.

You say religion divides. And well I don't disagree with that. The major factors for war have always been greed, power and lust. 

Shalom shalom. God bless. Seems strange to not believe in religion but to be certain that nothing happens after you die.

I understand the absolute disbelief of man made religions but it seems just as arrogant to say that you are certain nothing happens after death as it does to say X or Y god is real. Don’t forget Judaism Fuck all atheism

Atheism is stupid and fucking useless. This is because I say so. Leave your atheistic beliefs. The Chinese are atheist and kill millions, you are a murderer as well.


- sounds pretty fucking retarded when you think with your brain Has this person not heard of communism. That alone has caused just about 100 million deaths in less than 100 years. Thank Stalin and mao for that. Very anti religious people. Before religion there was the ""eye for an eye"" and even before that, if you harmed someone, they were entitled to murder your entire family. Religion shows one way to deal with human urges instead of pouring them into the world. Wa wa cry Jeez, what's worse? A religious figure shoving scriptures down an atheist's throat or an athiest griping at a religious figure about the religion they worship? Why cant people just let others believe/not believe what they want? This post is honestly pretty toxic, I dont know why people cant just do what they want as long as it doesn't harm others Go back to tumblr No doubt religion has been used for violent wars and mass control of the masses but that doesn’t mean religion is inherently evil, only that people have manipulated it for their own selfish ends. TEEHEE at leaST YOU LoVe ThE jEWs. OP said Fuck Islam. Good bye OP. It was nice to read your last post. no On this same topic how about religions that don’t have a defining deity? I have quite a few buddhist friends and Wiccan friends who sure, “believe in fairy tales” according to me and a lot of other people around me, but they are some of the nicest folks I know and none of them pledge to any gods, sure Buddha is a figure head, but I haven’t my found a single person who worships Buddha, only the occasional person who follows the path of the Buddha, and only one of the wiccans I know actually “worships” the moon, the other two just hold a hefty respect for nature. What are some opinions on that line of thought?

Not trying to say these religions haven’t caused violence because any belief, hell fuck that, any difference that any human has ever had with another human has caused bloodshed at some point, but I have always found these religions more interesting to talk about then typical “I give my life and soul to god” religions. Full disclosure: I'm currently a Christian, but I have serious doubts about my faith. I appreciate the skepticism of your post, but there are some things I disagree with.

>You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.

So what? Even if people are only religious because they're scared of death, this wouldn't make religion false. 

>Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe. What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.

Why do you support ""faith in people"", but not religious faith? Isn't faith the very thing you are trying to eradicate? If you're against believing things without evidence, then both kinds of faith should be wrong. Also, your claim that we control our destiny seems incompatible with materialism(I assume you don't believe in souls), as then we would be subject to physical laws.

>Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

I disagree with your second sentence there. Many of the great scientists of the past were religious. George Lemaitre, who developed the Big Bang theory, was a Catholic priest. The monk Gregor Mendel's work on heredity is crucial for our modern understanding of evolution. Those are just two examples. However, I'll be the first to admit that religion and science haven't always been harmonious, but I don't think they're entirely incompatible either. 

Additionally, why do you think ""nothing divides us except religion""? Unless you're defining religion super broadly, I'm unconvinced of this. In my experience, politics is just as, if not more, divisive. Also, religion can unite people by giving them a common purpose and meaning.

I sincerely don't mean to downplay the religious violence going on in India. It is absolutely terrible and there is no justifying it. However, I would challenge the idea that religion itself is entirely to blame. If religion were to be wiped off the earth tomorrow, I doubt that evil people would go away, and the regimes of Stalin and Pol Pot are evidence of this. The real problem, in my view, is ideological extremism and the gullibility of people to go along with it. These problems can occur whether religion exists or not.

One final point: Throughout your post you say that humans have an obligation to make the world better. My question is: What is the evidence that this obligation exists, and why should anyone follow it? I'm not a moral relativist, but I have been struggling lately with justifying my own belief in objective moral values. 👀 Damn who hurt you bro I know no one will read it, but anyway.
Author, you are super childish and maximalist. I had same ideas about religion when I was 18, but now I actually understand, how stupid I was back then. Yes, blind faith and all the violence, to which some religions and some people, acting religious, lead, is a bad part.
But religion also helps people to cope, for example with a loss of loved ones. Religion helps people to unite together in a community and help each other. Religion is set to promote kindness and prevent violence. Religion helps to achieve an inner peace and solve an existential crisis for some people.
Religion (and discussing particular ones) is a hard topic but your outlook on it, as I already said, is absolutely childish and wrong, only looking at one part of it. This is the most reddit post ive seen in months Agree Hey man I’m atheist as well but you really are mad, (I didn’t read through the whole thing so if there is a personal reason sry) OP is a pompous douche bag. >Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion.

Prove its made up. Im not defending religion, but you do not know either way, or apparently have the ability to critically think. What was the point of this anyways? Looking for validation? Someone piss you off? 

You'll get over it. After taking enough fungi and such, religion is trying to describe an essence that it can't be spoken about really, and it isn't a power held above you as Christianity may describe a god as. What it tries to describe is really just the whole picture and each living thing from a microbe to a giant whale is apart of this whole. There is benefit to spiritualism I think, and for each person that path can be different or even non existent. It's just always better, I find, to keep it to yourself and not involve other people. Science has proved that there has to be a creator. You seem to have a lot of hate built up inside you. Stay positive. By saying fuck all religion you are just spreading hate as an atheist. War is inevitable with or without religion. [George Carlin’s take on this](https://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE) This is the best post I have ever read!  Finally a sensible person speaking sensibly. Agreed in every way! Religion ruins us. Can someone explain? Sorry I’m out of the loop a few of your arguments do make sense at a microscopic level..but look

let people do whatever the fuck they want to do

however if you still insist on digging your nose in these matters, god as a concept rather than a rightful entity could be encouraged instead of going all the way and proposing atheism

also, religion to some is a source of reason/purpose so don't tread on it I would rather choose to believe and in the end be wrong, than live a life believing in nothing and in the end be right.  You are entitled to your opinion, just as anyone else, and I completely support that. But for you to say that what we believe in is ""wrong"" when you have absolutely no proof that there is no higher power, is the same as me saying that you are wrong because there is a higher power. There is no proof either way, that's why they call it faith.  I have friends of all walks of life, hindu, christian, muslim, atheist, and so-forth. None are wrong and none are right. Atheist governments commit mass killings as well. [Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes)  genocide isn’t exclusive to religion, in fact countless people throughout history (and modern day) have been and continue to be killed for simply having a religion. [cheers](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O35Dxb_V2Sc) Maybe if you had some religion you wouldn’t be such an angry bitter person with a potty mouth. Religion is just a tool used by the powerful to stay in power. If it wasn't for religion, it would be immigration, social status, education literally anything.

The problem isn't religion. The problem is the us vs them mentality. Religion is just the means to end. I am always surprised at the Indians inability to work together. Ethnically you are the same. THe english came raped your nation and your people. They left you divided because the wanted to return as your masters. That did not happen, but The west is till your master. You all bleed the same. You are all Indian. Become the power you are meant to be abandon religion and bath in the blood of people like modhi who would promote it. join $DCLT! When you have nothing, religion sounds pretty good. Organized religion is mostly shit.

But that doesn't mean god isnt real. The New Testament is hostile to religion. Yeah, but get rid of the cast system first. Haha OP didn't point Jainism, Sikhism in his post, Jainism and Sikhism are the best religions!! /s Okay but if our existence is indeed pointless, why do scientists then proceed to do all they can to unlock the secrets to the universe and our planet, and to rationalise everything? Simply put, they fear the idea of being a tiny speck in the grand scheme, the same is said for the general public, and of the general public; religious people. Everyone has there own way of coping with insignificance, some people even like to be assholes, and take a lot minutes and even hours out of their miniscule time of existence to do just that, those people are you. If you can't respect other people's decisions and choices, how do you expect your own to be respected in return? Should people even take your opinion seriously if you continue like this? Remember that respecting someone's opinion is different to agreeing with it, if you disagree with their opinion, it doesn't meant you have to disrespect them. Just let people be, instead of creating a negative and depressing energy for everyone around you. After all, your existence is pointless and you can't do anything significant to change how the universe works, so why not just live out that existence in peace and happiness? Honestly I think religion is just a tool, like knife or gun and stuff. It will be just replaced to something else if we somehow erase it completely.

I really do understand religion's doing more bad than good nowadays, (our country's Coronavirus infectee's almost tripled thanks to one trashy believer) maybe it's just human nature to have conflict and discriminate. Obviously I do not think both are good, but seeing the world made me think that way. You just started another one! Well, that's just, like, your opinion, man...

The Big Lebowski The Way I see religion is it’s a way to follow life even if it means nothing in the end it’s part of our species at this point and I think it’s just nice to follow somthing in life kinda like a government you specifically address supernatural religions in this rant / well-put point. what about naturalistic religions? Modern Satanism for example  \- Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 

I am actually really looking forward to the opportunity to be part of a supernova. Seriously though look at the Catholic church and the Vatican i keep reading reports about these sick fucks molesting children and they think once they die THEY are going to heaven? HAHAHA The pope is such a farce get fucked you sick child molesting ass clowns.
#FUCKALLRELIGION I mean I don’t believe in any religion either, but the people who do aren’t hurting anybody by believing in something more, and it makes them feel better. Atheism is a religion just like other religions. Religion poisons everything You sure do have a strong distaste for something you don't believe in. Interesting. Tell me more about how or what I should believe. Thanks. I discovered this when I was 8. Fuck you too :). If heaven exists, a Muslim might go to heaven. A Christian might go to heaven. A jew might go to heaven. But a Atheist is forever in the grave r/atheism is leaking This sounds like the “talk” every religion has right before trying out that mass murder thing you speak of. Maybe human nature is more to blame join a group>become fanatical>fuck shit up. It’s the rinse and repeat of mankind acting super special cause you have the answer. Not wanting to start anything just know that one search and word replace and you become the people you’re bitching about. The biggest problem with religion has always been the people. They try to twist the words to fit their world view and when they need to do that it is never about their god anymore. Let us blame everything on religion, and absolutely not on humans lust, greed, wrath, envy, pride, gluttony and avarice. Sure it is easy for you to hate on religion when you feel abandoned by the entity that we call god. 

Do you really believe that we advanced in technology because we ""worked together"" or is it who can dominate who first? 

Humans are a spectrum that goes from evil to good and people are spread out in that spectrum, and very few people are really fking pure and are good but alot of people are fking evil. We manipulate, we decieve, we conspire and we kill for our gain. Religion is a trend that nations use to motivate if there was no religion there would be something else to motivate people to kill and rape. Don't put it on religion because you are so fking arrogant and ignorant to your leaders and humanity.  

You say religion is a fairy tail but what you are talking about is the biggest fairytail there is, people working together, holding hands and dancing to we are the world. Sit your fking ass down you clown. Let me ask you this how the fk do you know that there is nothing after death, the very argument you use to ""put religius people in place"" is a two edged sword, how the fk do you know that there is nothing after death? 

Let people believe what they want to believe, jesus we have people that thing there are billions of genders, and media is fking supporting them and condemming religion. You are a puppet my friend we all are so stop acting like you know whos behind the scene nobody knows in the end we all will die and by then will figure out whos right and whos wrong, id rather be religius and die if there is something after death il be doing fine and if there is nothing il be fine too, but guess if there is something after death and it is one of those religius beliefs that is ""right"" and you are an athiest who shittalked people for being religius guess where you are going my friend... hell or being reincarneted as you again you cunt. Christians in America especially. I love to read about ancient history and one thing I've learned is that most Christians don't have a clue how the bible was written or how it was rewritten. I highly suggest Misquoting Jesus if anyone wants a deep dive. Most Christians just blindly follow and believe whatever they are told, and that imo is a cult lead by false prophets. Christians are such ignorant children. I agree.
But i think when christianity first got invented it might have had some actually good things to say.
The sad thing is emperors used religion to control people rewriting the bible while doing so.
And now it's full of random stuff that is only there because it was useful to some person in a high position. Chill bhai What you are all referring to is organised religion. Organised religion is a huge cause of death and unrestbut normal religion is fine. Chill. Not to seem like that guy, but our sun will not go supernova, rather it will expand as a red giant and then shrink to a white dwarf where it will remain dominant with the earth added to it. Also you cant just rudely tell people to abandon religion and expect them to listen.

Edit- I am a retard and cannot spell Yea same Religion can be a source of evil, but most of the values they teach give guidence and hope to people to live good lives, I believe that many people have realized religion is bullshit and any creation story for fables are made up. But the message they teach can help those in their darkest hour

You never hear about people leading good lives from religion but only the horrors of greed and power hungry corrupt members. To smear the brush wide you forget the benefits that these organizations create too. So personally, fucking them all isn't a fair assessment of the situation to be honest Religion is opium for the masses. I can joke about Jesus without fear of being killed. Lol at people arguing over which country is the least worst. If anyone here thinks religion is worthless or that we are better off without it, you haven’t engaged with religion on a serious, academic level, which means you don’t understand a crucial aspect of humanity. You don’t understand human culture. Every religion offers vital insights into the collective unconscious of human cultures. Highly recommend reading Nietzsche’s “Thus Spoke Zarathustra” or honestly any work by Carl Jung. Wanting to get rid of religion is like throwing the baby out with the bath water. How many wars do not have their roots in religion?  A retired general once told me he had studied it during his time in the forces and he couldn't find any.  Is this true? Damn son, who hurt you? Big mood [deleted] A fitting song

[Propagandhi - Haille Sellasse, Up Your Ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPpXY1aWKgI) I think it was Jaggi Vasudev who said something along the line of “to believe in god is ignorance, to not believe in god is ignorance “ in relation to observation perception and fundamental human growth. Basically stay in our own lane but don’t act haughty. While what they believe in may be fiction, they still believe in it. Even if you want to believe otherwise, religion has a very prominent impact on our society, and we have to understand and accept that. To say “fuck Religion” on Reddit isn’t exactly a means to an end. ""I think it's a waste of time"" cool, and you're allowed to, just like I'm allowed to be a christian. Stop going out of your way to shit on things that bring people peace just because you're bitter and unhappy Would be cool if people cited their rants more often. The Middle East is living proof that Religion is cancer. Especially when it takes control of the government. Go owfff Wow this started a whole war in the comments 😂 Probably not* the best way to start that claim. Preach it brother! Not takings sides here but let’s call any religion what it truly is ... an organized belief system.  Since we live in a world where things create other things, there must be something (aka God, Buddha, Allah etc?) to help explain the creation of man in order to convince, control, and organize the vulnerable believers. More people have been killed on this earth over religion than any other means ... we need to stop the madness!!!! I haven’t read all this. But about 2 years ago I felt exactly the same way. I absolutely DESPISED religion with a burning passion as well as 99% of the people who believe in it.

I’m not a practicing religious person by any means, but I know now there is more out there, outside of what we can touch. I had a spiritual awakening similar to when people take DMT but I didn’t take any drugs and it lasted about 6 months before I realised what was going on. Thought I was going insane at first. Either way, calm down lol. You’re showing your age. We ourselves are more to blame rather than ""religion"".
Fuck all of us! The reason that I am not an atheist, is because it is entirely unhelpful. I gain nothing from it whereas from christianity I gain happiness and companionship. 
Another way I have always looked at it is:

Atheism:
                Best case scenario: nothing |
                Worst case scenario: hell

Religion:
               best case scenario: heaven |
               Worst case scenario: nothing

Edit: formatting Let me change ""Fuck all Religion"" to ""Fuck all conservative religion"". If your religion makes you close your mind then yes fuck your religion. Fuck India and all the awful assholes that answer phones for American companies there... I know the negative impact of the religious sentiments but its not all bad, it does give a answer to questions like why is it wrong to commit suicide or murder. While undoubtedly everyone should form their own belief system instead of believing in anyone but i think we are quite far away from there, cause if you reject religion that can descend into nihilism and that is not exactly a good belief system if your life is going downhill, that is basically like flirting with suicide, so i the bleakest of moment religion can be a ray of light and its all empowering when it concern only the individual but lets be honest here religion always end up becoming institutionalized. My reply: (deep breath) I know it's funny to be an edgy 13 year old that trashed on religion and then point out others are meaningless since you know you're life is meaningless but here's a fact. The biggest removal of religion in the USSR killed hundreds of times more than religion did in history. Ugh fuck off shit dude, let people live their lives. i’m not even religious but chill 🤣 Penis. South park is !y religion Here’s the big problem with what you are saying. We all don’t know for sure if God or gods are real. But a lot of people choose to believe because there sad and depressed and need love. So think about what your gonna say before you say it. Also scientists still have not found concrete proof that we evolved from something in the water. And there is the fact they can’t replicate fossilization. Look it up!!! I believe in God, not religion. Genuinely asking but why do a lot of you hate religion? Saying that their is no greater Being or after life eventually leads to nihilism. If we're just a speck in space and in the end I get nothing and the world just implodes, why not kill myself and everyone else off? Why even live? It doesn't matter in the end does it?

I'm not a religious fanatic myself, but their is value in religion and it's teachings. Morals eventually derive from some form of religion. Just because there was bad done by people claiming to be religious, doesn't mean all religion is bad does it?

Science has created the atomic bomb. Science has led to guns and mustard gas. But not all science is bad is it? Science has made medical advancements and has  increased life expectancy.

Religion has given a lot of people a sense of direction and morality. I gurantee there are more Christian's helping those starving in Africa than atheists. Gurantee it.

I hope all of you understand where I'm coming from and I understand where a lot of you are coming from. There have been a lot of religious assholes. But it has also help guide us in terms of science and morality. It's not all bad. You can choose what to believe but don't shit on all religion because it had some bad eggs. 

Best to all of you! 

The problem doesn't lie in religion itself but the institutionalization happed after they were formed. I am a Hindu and I like to read different school of thoughts in  sanatan dharma. The main problem of today's religion and their followers is they have very institutionalized thought processes. India is the land of seekers. We have embraced atheism long before it was ""Cool"". You can look for Charvaka school of philosophy which is basically seeking truth in the form of materialism and atheism. I partly agree that religion is root cause of major problems in world today but that is not because of religion it self but what humans did with it. We pitted each religion against each other to justify our war mongering nature. If you closely observe historical timeline you'll observe that majority of wars that were fought on basis of religion, were in times when there were very few advances in philosophies of each religion. Religion is meant to serve personal values but unfortunately we humans have used it to justify our actions. 

For the fellow atheists here, I respect your choice of atheism. But we are the part devil of this world as well. And lastly why don't we blame Science for creation of nuclear weapons which can annihilate world in matter of minutes? We can't, cause we know that it's devil that we created ourselves out of nuclear science just like we did with religion and created intolerance, terrorism etc. Science and religion are two very powerful philosophies but their right use depends on us. Lmao ok boomer There's a difference. I do have some faith that there is a God, I just don't believe in religion. Religion is run like a business... For someone who hates religion you sure do talk about it a lot ha ha. Honestly you just sound angry, and hurt. HOLLA! yea religion is not the reason people kill and hate eachother. Its a human nature. Lots of animals kill eachother as well,even their own species and they are not religious as far as I know Boedhism ain't a religion per se. This post is wildly hateful. Tread carefully India. I say we just exterminate the human race. Please donate to my cause You left out Judaism.  Slicing baby's dicks apart is the ultimate violation of human rights. To say something came from nothing is insanity. Are you insane? The desperation in trying to push your own beliefs on others suggest you are. Bro just live your life. When you die you will know for sure what is on the other side. Leave me out of it. I will can contest you on your claim that we evolved. Okay doomer The tipping is strong with this one. Religion is like a teddy bear. It was useful for our species in our infancy, when our ignorance needed some psychological crutch to calm us down in this scary universe. However, as we are about to enter our adult phase, it's past time we leave our psychological-comfort teddy bears behind. I think Indian societal norms are from that of the Stone Age. There’s hundreds of sexual assault cases there that don’t even get heard. Child abuse does not even faze the Indian public nor apparently does child trafficking nor child marriages. You try to make a fair argument, but the basic idea of religion is the shared belief on being moral.

It may sound like stating the obvious but there is a difference with being moral and in believing it.

To some it may be a small difference to others not.

(For example filtering the world in our conscience to have a good inner voice. What ever we think, we try to think in a certain positive way. 

Rather than not necessarily believing, and just see how we feel about the situation. How we process the world is Thus different. The filter is of our own making and random.

And it might affect a person in the sense they feel less empathy or care less especially when no one is watching.

They might forget to process things in a certain way, and their language might also change and their emotions as a result as well.)

But also to make things more obscure we are dealing with a world that is religious, so how can you say that people not believing in being good is going to make them better especially when no one is watching?

We are also dealing with a lot of benefits and welfare, what will happen to the morality of people in a moment of crisis if they don’t have the custom of believing in being good?

I can understand The want to make the world a better place, but freedom of religion is the best to hope for. Trying to change the dynamics too much is another uncertainty.

For example can you guarantee security and wealth so people are not dealing with circumstances that may be ‘believing’ morality will have more benefits than not (presumably).

I think if people want to make the world a better place it comes from those things in improving people’s lives. That is with technology. And I think we don’t quite have that level of technology to quite easily say that abandoning a belief system will be better. Since even being just moral, implies some kind of belief in a constitution to make it work in tough times, when no one is watching. For example almost every country is dealing with a significant amount of corruption, will them having less faith, or not having to pretend to be ‘faithful’ have more positive effects on corruption or not?

Ona global scale religion is different than before. The conversation regarding religion in public generally involves people being and ‘acting’ good. At least they have to ‘act’ good which is still important imo. There is a net benefit not just how it translate to a certain culture of caring, or good action but also the psychological impact it can have to be an inclusive society rather than one that is more capitalistic and is a dog eat dogs world.

I think by rejecting the belief in being good, rather than just common sense or common interests Of being good, can quickly shift human behavior to be more unhealthy. We can also look at humans being savage without laws and instructions. Their natural state is quite barbaric, which is why the point of technology and being a utopia is important. The barbaric humans of the past did not have a belief system and even if they did, their lives were too extreme to have a use for it. It took humans a long time to reach this level of society and religion was their crutch for good or bad. Which is why it is a big uncertainty due to their basic nature and their dependence on religion, to say wether they would be good without religion.

Just like philosophers of the past have studied human behavior and some will say humans need to be taught to be good to be good. ""Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing""

&#x200B;

Same statement as believing in God, the fuck you know about post-death, how the fuck you can prove it. Religion isn’t meant to be a collection of stories, but an easier interpretation of complex morals and values.  Hinduism, specifically, is not a religion as Western Philosophy has deemed, but more so a lifestyle, a way of living.  It truly is a beautiful conception of our reality, in which each god is a symbol for humanly needs (Lakshmi for wealth, Hanuman for strength, Ganesha for perseverance, etc). And in turn, we use prayer to each God as a way to ease the mind and focus on one entity.  Hinduism says that we are all one, and oneness is derived from ultimately dissolving the ego.

Religion isn’t supposed to be a collection of fiction and stories, but a teaching of what life is.  It is a collection of teachings from many different individuals, who place these teachings in the format of stories so it is easier to understand. Disbelief in a god is also a belief itself. You cannot claim to know the universal truth when it is not possible. Thank the universe someone finally said it! Its not religion its confessions that harms humanity. You can try to think of an religion that simply believes in the power of love and set love above all other things. 
It would not harm humanity. By definition it cant harm humanity.
You get the point?
I think there was a guy called jesus. Might be he had an similar idea...
Point is the biggest utopies (e.g. Religions, communism) will always be most likely abused by people not believing in anything and harm humanity. Only a sith deals in absolutes Why you so mad ? 😟 Didn't know I was on r/cringe Op probably wouldn’t be so angry about what other people think if he found peace in religion, just saying. Lol eat a dick Religion is a crutch that was once required and helped greatly in the structure of societies, the problem is, like with anything, when it came time to move on from it, the people involved were earning too much money and garnered more respect and power than they ever could have on their own so they abused their power to stifle progress that would have made them obsolete.

 The problem now is indoctrination through repetition, and, although I understand your anger, arguments are seldom won by the person telling everyone else how stupid they are, especially when we (humanity/science) have only answered some of lifes questions and their religion offers all the answers, albeit wrong ones. Woah guys we have an edgy atheist here ok cool Religion is not a problem, people having different beliefs and values than you is not a problem. You are so blind to your hatred of people who believes differently than you to see your attitude is the problem. Your attitude is shared by people of religion about other religions, non-believers, and people who scare them because their different. Everyone wants to fit every body into their own box, instead of accepting the fact that people are going to believe how they choose to believe. I am a proud Christian and I love people, I have views that differ from the rest of the world I know that. I will never force my beliefs or views on others, but I expect the same respect from others. You have the right to feel the way you do, that’s ok, but to belittle people and a destructive and aggressive way is not the best way to address our differences. Learn to have respect for your fellow humans that believe differently than you, don’t box yourself in to a small area. Just my opinion take it for what you will /r/copypasta Religion isn't the problem it's the idiots that don't know how to follow religious values/rules. Yeah I’ll never get over how call culty organized religion is I will continue to be religious and not become a miserable prick like yourself. Enjoy your pessimistic lifestyle and tell me again about how my life beliefs make me as miserable and incorrigible as yourself! Believe what you want to believe but if it makes you this down on life I would think into other options my friend. Lol you clown Well said. Shut the fuck up. You don't know anything for a fact, just the same as a theist. Nobody knows what happens after death, nobody knows whether there's a God. Plenty of things divide us, not just religion. r/enlightenedcentrism This is so beautiful omg. 
Thanks for proving words can be breathtaking Wow so woke cause religion bad Yep all religion. Fuck your cross and for head burka shits. Amen. Fuck any God! Nah I'm good bruh r/EdgyAthiest Fuch ewe. have you died ? how do you know theres nothing after? energy never dies? oh waits its just YOUR belives. > You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter.  

This is a subjective claim, but I would argue that this is very wrong. As far as we know there is no other life in this universe except on Earth. Also, as far as we know there is no other form of life in the universe as intelligent as a human. The Earth may be a (giant to us) tiny speck floating in the vast expanse, but that expanse is speckled  with unliving and unintelligent stuff. As far as significance, the human race may be the most amazing product of the universe so far. Yarr this dude is going to HELL¡! Well that’s just like, your pinion man. Yes yes and fucking yes. Religion is the worst of all evils I'll  never understand why someone is so angry with something they dont have to be a part of  idgaf if you dont believe in what I believe in. That's your decision and I'm happy you have the right to believe what you want to believe.
Edit: typo This is bs.

1- He  stated facts that are not facts at all, like we coming from Africa 300k years ago, we dont know for sure.

2- He is against religion but then speak about we are nothing on the big schemes of things? This is actually paraphrasing many religions out there.

3- No one gives a shit about religion, wars are not made on religion, the people who creates wars, they just put a catchy name to it to force people to move but they themselves dont give two fucks about a war because of religion or resources.

3.1- Atheist also make as many wars as they please

4-Atheism is just another bs as well as religion you people are the opposite faces of the same coin. Everything u talk as well as deeply religious guys is pure trash. Dont you fucking think u are outside the bubble of human beings and think you are being objective, like that would be actually laughable.

5- Religious people as well as agnostics or atheists follow the same bs, thinking the have the reason and that they know it all. Lmao you guys give me a break. There is religion yes, but there is also a connection to the Universe that we all have. A connection that doesn’t require you to be religious. Religion has set us back so far it’s hilarious. I thought 18 was the minimum age for reddit No thanks As I was reading this post, I could only think of the Quote from ""Pale Blue Dot"" by Carl Sagan 

""  hat's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.   ""

We are nothing but mote of dust suspended in a sun beam. And here we are fighting in the name of the unknown. You can have your religions AND be loyal to your species. Don't worry about religion if you don't want a part in it. Every person is an individual autonomous person, so why are you going to spend so much time being against their decisions? Just enjoy your own way, and if these are your complaints, then be, in your character, the way  you want to see others in your world act. Just because some people are, of my personal opinion, stupid and warlike, doesn't really mean that Religion is the primary cause. Sure, religion is easy to blame, because people like to use it as a way to justify their aggression and transgressions by ""Invoking the law of the lord"" or some other mindless and willful reason.

People are afraid to change their ways of life, and religious discrimination has been the main cause of unrest in India, usually not religion in and of itself. Religion is a positive thing, you can't just stop something from existing because you hate it. How about nurturing it into something that can actually be positive and helpful to the world?

Avoiding conflict is often as simple as moving forward. When you put down your weapons and abandon your conflicts, progress happens. Happy lives can happen. Simple as that.

EDIT: After sifting through some comments, I think what OP may be expressing is the lack of an outlet for those who are not interested in religion whatsoever. And that's fine. I think that non-religious culture greatly benefits the interests of everyone. Just a matter of waiting for people to wake the fuck up. Amen brother. A-fukken-men. Interesting Post detailing you opinion. I don't want to start an debate because God knows its been done before by men/women more better versed than myself. 

As a scientist, I am left with evidence that points to the existence of an all powerful all knowing God. 

Matter and Energy Exists: Where did it come from? Another universe? Maybe but where did that come from? Our universe requires causality but what caused the first cause? Perhaps something without a cause, without beginning nor end. 

Matter and Energy Behaves in a constant manner: We know there are attractive and repulsive forces which dictate bonding and energy levels but we have no idea why this is the case. Its like a universal ""settings"" tab running the background keeping the laws that govern this universe constant. 

Also, saying F\*ck all religious doesn't make you sound too smart. cheers, ill drink to that Ummmmm ya Amen. Talk about tolerance of other beliefs eh?
One of the main reasons India will never thrive because it's people don't have tolerance so you can Hindus in charge the country will be a shithole, you can have Atheists in charge the country in charge but until you develop tolerance for other beliefs you will be stuck in the stone age. Actually religion has brought peace to me. Fuck modi and his cronies. He’s a top class chutiya. He’s the hitler of the brownies. Let’s be honest. That’s what this post should have been about. For thousands of year people have co-existed and also they had their fair share of wars. So much hatred is out there😓 I can't believe it still exists in 2020. Glad the trends say it's going away Fuck people who try to push their beliefs onto others. That includes you. Yikes. I disagree. Wait, not Jainism. Right? Sir this is a mcdonalds Fuck you Fuck you! Imagine if people got into wars over whether or not Santa was real. As an Indian, I approve of this sentiment. I will gladly vote for a politician who runs on a policy of abolishing religion from our country and from the face of this world. Any plans of running? i was born in a muslim family, same here, i think religions are nothing but some kind of culture. Let the enlightenment spread.  It is time. We are alone on a rock floating through space, we have invented everything on this planet and “gods” are for people who cannot hang with the idea of the endlessness of the universe.  It’s time to move on to space. PRAISE r/cornbible I do not belive in God or ANY religion.

BUT

You have to be an even bigger moron than the biggest religious zealot to say, WITHOUT A DOUBT, that there is nothing after death. Simply saying to yourself that there 100% cannot be anything makes you look like an idiot. Can you time travel? Can you travel to the beginning of time? No? Then stop acting like you can. Nobody knows. There is probably nothing but nobody knows except people that have died. Fanatism and lack of education go hand-in-hand. Every time I hear about religion riots in India, inevitably follows another report with lives lost. Reminds me of the ""holy wars"" of medieval Europe. Amen! y’all are so pathetic it’s sad i actually believe in a dimension where all dead people go, but i aint believing in a zombie On an unrelated note, I felt like playing DOOM 2016 after reading this. I don't think Buddhism counts here, especially Zen. While I don't agree with religion in alot of context especially when used hypocritically or to cause harm , there is alot of truth in myth , in archetypes , consciousness and practices especially in buddhism. Take rebirth for example, from a scientific standpoint if the universe created life why cant it decompose it then create a new stucture from it. Your Belief isn't going to replace certain truths and reality especially in things like consciousness. However in terms of childish belief people are more unreasonable and unreliable than any religious teachings lol. See your statement of you do not matter but matter exist is contradictory in nature, & even things like immortality isn't such a far-fetched concept as technology progresses so are we suppose to abandon science when that becomes religion and then passes into myth. I remember my fifteenth birthday too, good times. >Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism.  
>  
>Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.  
>  
>You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.

You just described Buddhism. Amén! Ok Better to be a non-organized spiritualist then be a member of any kinda specific religion. Your points are highly valid tho. Can't saying this kind of thing get you in trouble in your country? Ironically, in trying to stop divisions your anger and hostility may create them, people are more receptive to calm and well-argued people. 

I'm religious, the only thing i oppose in your argument is that religion is made up. That is it. Yes we die. Yes there may not be anything beyond this. Yes violence is bad. Yes religion is very divisive. Yes your legacy should be based on being good to mankind. 

You're angry, that's fine. But in the end people will always believe in religion, your anger only seeks to do the thing you don't want, make divisions. Calm down. What do you say to the people who's religion helped them become a better person? Is this a new religion? Amen. But you go to the moon before clean water and sanitation. Have fun shitting in rivers... the Roman’s had fucking sewers but India says fuck it let’s go to the moon. Because our brains create problems, I can see how religion seems like a problem. But, on the other hand, because our brains will religify just about anything, I can see how not having any at all would make them all that more difficult to trace, and therefore dangerous to battle. We all tend towards the worship and zealotry of something, the religious are just surprisingly less delusional on this point than the non-religious. All cultures have had three things in common since time immemorial 

Art

Music

Religion 

Religion is hardwired into us for some reason. Plus there are so many mysteries in this world that really can’t be explained. Look up reincarnated children on YouTube. Not that reincarnation has anything to do with religion. Religions have adopted reincarnation as a perk, however. I feel the same way about reality shows like Nach Baliye and Dance Plus. Fuck all ya'll for watching crap TV and encouraging them to make more, you're just filling your minds with pointless crap.

Boredom is good for your mental health. Saying that there is no experience after death is just as flawed as saying that there is experience after death. It is true they religion has caused many problems in the world, but you don’t know any better than anyone else does. By acting like you do, you are just as toxic as a close minded religious person. It’s funny someone can believe so wholeheartedly something so specific happened 300,000 years ago but completely dismiss something else. What u believe doesn't matter 👹👹😾😾 I hate that people are allowed to be taught religion by their parents. Especially Islam. Islam is designed only for the purpose of oppressing women, but even the women don't realize it because they're taught that it's okay essentially from birth. Lol you sound young. *grabs popcorn* If anyone commits violence in the name of religion, it's settled; they're a massive Mcfucknugget. Yo who didn't fuck their mans right Amen. ""Open your mind"" 😂. And yet they're telling people what to believe. [deleted] Atheistic Anarchism will be the real salvation of humanity. Whot is this india The main cause of strife in the world is jackasses trying to tell everybody else what to do.

  

Sit down, shut up and chill TFO. So much hate in this post. :( Darwin Award tl:dr Fuck freedom of choice, fuck culture, fuck age, fuck gender, fuck me hating cheese, fuck you hating me hating cheese, fuck ducks, fuck kids, fuck moms, fuck language,  duck you, fuck me, fuck everybody

Welcome to the divided world
By design
Not my design

It reminds me of the second renassaince, animatrix ""....and for a time, it was good..."" Just putting it out here that atheists are just as idiotic/smart as the people who believe in religion. If you want to ""Fuck"" religion, try being agnostic. You go nowhere with a closed ideology of atheism. WORD My faith makes me happy, i don't push it onto anyone, i just practise it myself. I don't see why i should leave that, your post is grossly generalizing.

It also brings me and my local community togther, which is nice for the many who aren't equipped with stable social lives. Jesus loves you Woah there This is some real Cosmicism thinking. 10s of thousands of years of theology? Obliterated, reduced to mere atoms. Christards? Owned 😎 It really just depends on what we really believe in. If you believe in God then just believe. Then there are others that might be making up beliefs then calling it ""religion.""

God may be true to some but Religions are definitely man-made beliefs. Coming from r/all. If it’s forced or violent like it is in India of course. But you need to be able to believe what you believe in. some people just need it for hope. So fuck the religion that is inciting violence in India. I think we all secretly know this, but it's a nice distraction to believe in it instead of just believing that we're all gonna just die and become nothing. At least that's why I believe in religion. Religion isn’t evil, people are.

Sorry to burst your bubble love, but you seem a lot more childish with your little temper tantrum then any random religious person just minding their own business. 

I understand where you’re coming from, to atheists people of faith may easily appear as delusional fools who pray to a god to make themselves feel better about their existence...but who are we to take that from them? Who are we to snatch away their hope so cruelly? If it makes them happy, and indeed, encourages them to live a more moral lifestyle for fear of god’s wrath or the afterlife, then what is the harm? 

You accuse them of being foolish to believe in man made stories, but science is the same in that regard...in my eyes, the latter has far more credibility, but it is still just another concept manning has come up with in a desperate attempt to explain the word around us. 

It is, with all due respect, simply idiotic to say religion is the only thing that divides us...mankind is capable of deep kindness and empathy, but we are also capable of mindless hatred and violence. It is not religion to blame, but us. We allow any and all differences to divide us, be they religion, economic status, race, nationally, gender, sexual identity, or even age...it is foolish to try and blame religion for the endless bloodshed we cause. 
Indeed, it could easily be argued that, using your vehement rant as an example, it is also the very lack of religion that divides people.

I am not claiming religion is a force for good, but it is not a force for evil either. Merely a tool, used and twisted by humans for their own purposes. Some use it for good, spreading love and support, others use it to pit people against each other. Attack the people misusing it, not the religion itself. Do not give those people the excuse of blaming their religion. Their actions are their own.

Being an atheist does not mean you have to hate religion, or people who follow one. We pride ourselves on our oh so great logic, and then go around mindlessly mocking and hating people of faith, for what? Because it provides an easy scapegoat for us to take our frustrations with the world out on? If it helps them live a happier life, so be it! 

Live and let live!

Sorry for the long and drawn out response everyone, but I cannot understand why atheists insist on such a harsh attitude towards religion. 

Just because someone of some religion may have hurt you, doesn’t make religion inherently bad. Indeed, there are elements of religions that anyone could benefit from, e.g. meditiation

I’d highly recommend Alain de Botton’s ‘Religion for Atheists’ to anyone who’s interested :) Damn dude, you sound so certain. I’ll pray for you. lol Happy birthday! Seems unfair to lump in Buddhism with the others, it’s really more of a philosophy or way of thinking than a true religion. Soooo edgy. Regardless of how you feel about religion, its hard to deny that having a belief system and being forced to believe you have accountability for your actions in this life is not a bad thing for most people. This rant sounds reads like an adolescent emotional outburst. Chances are something in your past with religion has you stuck in an angry place. There certainly is value in discussing the worth of religion in general or just one in particular, but this is off the mark. Come back at it after you figure out what's really hurting you so bad. I mean we really don't know though, let people live. Those who try to force you to live or act some certain way can surely get fucked. I am not religious at all, but you talk about death like you died and came back to tell us what happened. You don't know that there is no rebirth or what happens after death. Get off your non-religious pedestal. You could make a religon out of this! Is it that time of the month? Many prayers needed here for many lost souls! I pray you learn and accept the truth before it’s too late! God sent us his only Son to be sacrificed so we can enter the kingdom of heaven. He died to save us as we are all sinners. Yes I am a Christian but I don’t believe in any specific religion. All you're doing with this post is isolating every religious person from your cause and contributing to the stereotype that atheists are unreasonable Tldr... but i agree. That's one opinion Whoever you are i love u! “The only that happens is you blackout and stop existing” 

Please prove that.

Y’all atheists have so much fucking hate You preaching the fact there is no god is the same as someone shoving religion down your fucking throat. You are as much of a cunt as the Pope. You're also a pussy if you're wondering. Ive recently been coming to terms with how ridiculous I think it is that everyone blames god for their success.  God didn't create modern technology, or scientific breakthroughs, or medical breakthroughs..

We did.  Human beings did all of it.  Everyone says how amazing God is, but they're all wrong.  Its not God who is amazing.  It is us that is amazing. bruh chill the fuck out, check out nihilism btw. Preach brother! Who is God to a non believer. I don’t like any religion. I’d rather have a simple life without thinking who i’m offending by not doing things by their bullshit superstitious sense.
I don’t know if religion is the problem or not. But i will say this: people have forgotten the faith that comes with the religion. They forgot that the biggest thing they need to do while worshipping their god is believing in him no matter what others say. If you get offended when someone questions or makes fun of your religion, then i’m sorry to say, its not having faith, its just being a fan of something and defending it just for selfish reasons (to prove that you can never be or choose something wrong). There’s no reason to be physical or offensive by other’s remarks, because what religion is only an agnostic’s benefit of doubt. Not sure I'd class Buddhism a religion. It can be if you want to believe all the made up magical shit. But it's more of a self help guide. someone needs to get laid The only part I disagree with is what happens when you die.. no fade to nothingness. Instead we’ll all be trippin our balls off on DMT. You’ve lost. You can make a religion out of this. You need Jesus You are going to be very surprised when you die.  I would not take the chance.  Besides, we all have to believe in something.


Its OK..I k ow you are made, but. Don't be made at religion..that's just crazy.

So, what is really the PROBLEM? oof To “blackout” is difficult to grasp if there is nothing further. If mind does not go further it cannot know “blackout”. Well written piece. I do have some questions. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. 
- Does this involve not caring about other species? Because religion does involve loyalty, to a point it’s blind. 


We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. 
-yeah, no on that. If you have a darker skin colour it doesn’t matter to some, who or what you believe in. Also, let’s learn from a war that is now known as the Second World War. Any suggestions how to go about these differences? 

As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. 
- Not always: ask anti-vaccine people among others


Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.
- I don’t agree with this statement, but holy cow, does history and recent events make it hard to disprove. Nothing divides us except religion? LOOL talk about someone not living in the real world. Now your are starting to get it.. God would not want to restrict his children but let them have their own free will. Name one religion where they preach free will over what they tell you are their standards.. Sir, this is a Wendy's. Sjw think its a unpopular opinion and they can go fuck themselves Amen. This is some good shit right here. I'm glad you said it man because this is shit i want to tell people every single day. The world would be immensely better without religion. Im underage and my parents force me to Go to church every Sunday morning i fins It a waste of time too >A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals and started making clay potteries, we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. **The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age.**

You're full of shit, buddy. All those discoveries Man found and made use of also facilitated murder, genocide, and invasions. This was done *eons* before the concept of religion was ever a thing, yet you don't point that out.

>Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.

Except genetic research have discovered many biological nuances in different ethnicities. So no, we are not the same.

>As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed.

The same science that created the atomic bomb? The same science that is behind mass surveillance threatening our privacy?

>Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Absolutely brilliant analysis, Lord Edge. yeah fuck god for making us suffer because some bitch ass took a bite from an apple It’s all nice saying all this but the fact of the matter is that the world you’ll I’ve in now has been shaped by religion, from the laws we have to infrastructures and landmarks so it can be said that religion is very much integrated into our society and it ain’t budging. As long as you practice your chosen faith and it isn’t affecting anyone else then yeah you be you. But religion ain’t going anywhere anytime soon soooooooooooooo..... deal with it I guess. 

Also don’t think religion is a bad thing, it’s given meaning to many peoples lives and this is where people comment of all the terrorism and wars....

Listen I don’t deny them but all throughout history there have been humans that do atrocious things, not religion. A philosophy can’t force you to do anything, it’s man that has committed those crimes. E.g Ghent is Khan, hitler - was denounced from Christianity, tried to create his own sect. Etc... Average redditor Sir, this is a Wendy's Amen to that :D no seriously totally agree I believe religions are a for of social psychology I only know that I don’t know Why no rebirth?? We were born already once right?? You're saying that cant happen again?? Goddamn there's so much hatred in this post? Did a priest put something in your butt? Did a Muslim bang your sister? It must suck to have that much negativity and hate you your mind all the time holy shit lol. And yet, at the end of the day, the epistemology of OP is exactly the same as a person of faith. There’s a lot of anger/pain in this post, but ultimately who truly knows with 100% certainty? No one. Humans divide thrmselves among many other factots aside from religion such as politics, race, income and even miniscules things like liking a band or if you're even a 'real fan'. The danger of religion is that not only do not a lot of people respect the authority which is God but people don't even believe in him as you cannot see or hear him and as a result logically it's fuckin stupid to believe in such a ridiculous  notion as God. If religion were to dissappear from this world would the world be a better place-probably not. As humans we will divide and fight with each other over other factors which will cause new problems. At the core of it as humans we always fight and divide ourselves with political and philosophical ideologies that aren't even extreme in nature as well as the ones that are naturally violent and call for violence. Buddhism’s pretty cool but, not really a profit machine just like an intrinsic sorta thing. Idk I’ve always respected it How about Rastafarianism? Ngl India is the most wretched place on this planet. Then life would be pointless. Bet op deals with constant mental issues and isn't far from suicidal. ...on the other hand, imagine how frighteningly overpopulated our planet would now be without the endless centuries of Divinely Deferential human slaughter.
""Attention Please: Converts, brunch is now being served in the dining hall; Blasphemers, report at once to the Client Intake window located in the East Concourse beside Death Pit 47-B."" I feel like this post is as likely to convince a religious person to drop religion as it is to try and convert OP to whatever religion Funny thing here about the writer of this rant regarding F*** all Religions.. Wonder if he/she in anytime in their lifes had prayed to God for anything.. I believe in a God...I don't have to hear him or see him to know something is responsible for the making of us for better or worse As much as I agree with this statement, it seems you have some historical facts wrong. I may be wrong too, but I'm pretty sure we didn't make tools from obsidian (at least that early), homo sapiens migrated out of Africa around 70 000 years ago, we started farming around 11 000 years ago, bricks were invented around 7500 BC and pottery around 30 000 BC, iron melts at 1500°C and was found around 6000 BC. Also I've never heard of a religion that's trying to take us back to the stone age.


And yes, I am fun at parties. How can you claim to know what happens after death? You have just as much or less proof for your atheistic, nihilistic, scientific world-view as any religious person does for theirs. Here are some fun facts about Equador. Im not from there but i talked to a girl from there that is a police officer and she told me about some laws and punishments they have for breaking them. The city she lives in is almost entirely atheist. If you get married in a church or you baptise your child in a church you will face 40 years of jail time. I know it sounds ridiculous but for example punishment for killing an animal or even abusing it is 35 years in jail, so i guess it could make sense. In my country on the other habd you got massive protests and religious walks about some law that gives the state right to take tax from churches and its property. Property in question are hotels, beaches, and so on that belong to church and that isnt paying any tax because it belongs ti the church. Dozens of millions of euros goes over those properties and nothing is taxed until now and people are mad because 'goverment is stealing the holy property to themselves'. Like wtf, those priests drive most expensive cars in my country, and yet people that barely even goes to church are defending them blindly like church stands above the state and ni laws apply to it. They want to drag us back couple of hundreds years in the past. So yes. Religion is the biggest problem in the world, and world woukd be much better and more peaceful if there wasn't any religions. Most wars were started because of religion, and all those beliefs in The Bible are pure mythology and fantasy, and it involves a lot if gore and sacrificing of people. Like yeah Noah lived over 300 years and people believe that. If you think this is about religion, you're very sorely wrong. 
It's tribalism; My group vs your group
This has absolutely nothing to do with religion and you know it. 

Religion is God's elicudiation of the proper lifestyle for man. What was best for him.

You're as delusional to believe in evolution (not all evolution) as the reason for humanity existing as it. Is today. You nor any scientist has EVER OBSERVED this type of change in a species over time. 
When you DO LET ME KNOW,  CAUSE IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

The people who don't have values and respect for each other are often born into religion. Then they don't care for it so they mold it into something for their own devices. Hence the people who can't understand when to fight and when not to. 

Islam is around 15% of India. If you expect them to do nothing and not defend themselves you lack as much empathy as the people fightning now. The Catholic church did get on Galileo’s case about his findings back then. I find it ridiculous that the Pope hasn’t condemned the ignorance of the early days of the church on its stance on astronomy and science. But it helps the needy and poor. It also teaches you good morals. /s Tbh youre right but I know that theyre so many bad things threw religion, which also even god hated he hated that we were killing people and then because of the bad things they did he punished them. But still I'm a believer I do understand your perspective tho which is also kinda mine. Im still kinda thinking tho but Imma still believe cuz the reward is higher in the long run IF its real so imma end it with amen peace bro. u/userleansbot You're  having that kind of bad day huh .

Heard about religious factions killing each other in Indians . Better hope you are right.. This is amazing. Thank you. I want to share it with every religious person I know. I don't know why this much hate on religion without actually knowing one. Religion Fandom is the oldest, You know what's current ? Cristiano Ronaldo Vs Messi, XBOX vs PS4, Castes, Region, Race, Color, etc..See I respect your views that Religion is a problem but Religion is not a problem, It became a problem because we are feeding a radical group called RSS and a Political Party name BJP. Who trying there best to highlight this Fandom of people. It's like One African came into your society and That one aunty who slowly told you one news, fact, history or fake information regarding the situation of African in africa, Slowly that one aunty became a group and one day society committee will bring up the issues and soon that family needs to leave the society. Same If you are bachelor. Even If you don't do anything bad some societies eventually kick you out because some so and so aunty feed the ears of society head that you were doing this and that.. Instead of Blaming the religion, We need to tackle this power.

When a PM said ,"" You can identify them by their clothes "" 
Yes, No religion teach Hate. No atheism or No Humanity taught you to hate on the basis of anything, be it religion or If you are the fan of Messi and I'm of Ronaldo. You making comments on reddit, by using your smartphone maybe, Quote what ? That's like last 200 years or so ? You know how easy a human mind distracts from things ? Did you know that, If your father said to you that Ohh boy use that Radio and listen songs, Your reply would be ,"" No dad, I have my smartphone "". You once used a DVD now not, Everything changes so fast. Science, technology etc. 

Did you know that religion in human history is one of the oldest and that So called Fandom is still going pretty strong. A human brain, who changes so frequently, throughout eras drop various things but why not religion ? Did you ever try to put your thoughts on that ? Why Religion is the Oldest stuff we got with us. Man People came and go, Many years fall apart, Civilizations come and go, technologies and Everything but this religion is still up in Human Life. 
So...I'm not an atheist but Whatever..I know someone created us and religion and everything going on is what the creater wishes for. We are in a movie which got a start and end. Watches one hitchens video What evidence do you have for this, that racism is being pushed further from core society. Look around you, racism is also integrated into the very structure of our society. Akala explains this very well if you watch a video of his. 

And remember, racism isnt an actively negative act to most. Religion is held in a different respect, like I said it has given meaning to most peoples lives and only small groups have taken advantage of it and become extremes of it. Truth be told if every religious person was “destructive” and dangerous then the whole world would be screwed because there would a civil war in every country. The truth is that, especially on reddit, people create perceptions of religions that deviate from the truth due to confirmation bias. What most on this site call echo chambers. 
This isn’t to say there aren’t any problems in religion. Long time ago I learned myself to manage not to fall in this religion dogma's. 
Believe it guys, it's really nice to see around. There are lot to see. Do you realise that by fucking all religions you become an atheist? Do you also realise that even atheists are kafirs? So unless you a paedophilic Mohammed follower, your life will be fucked up anyway. Better fuck Islam. Well said, well said! Agree with most of the comments here. Religions is the main root cause of unsettlements like wars, etc. We cannot deny that it is the inevitable result of our imaginations, the driving force that distinguishes us from other animals. It has contribute towards the advancement of human history.
Please refer to the book Sapiens: brief history of makind. Gives a more insightful and less biased view on religion. I don't particularly like the ideological references in response to violence, I do enjoy their message of peace,harmony and humanity as a brotherhood of one rather then a nation of many. 

The Nacaals never taught religion but they did mention the Grand Architect who is also referred to as ""Yahweh, God, etc. 

It's unfortunate individuals used that knowledge to pursue goals of greed and profit, to turn a coin off information of wealth. 

When we noticed your hearts weren't ready, we rescinded and left, in hopes in the future you could reach ascension and reach a higher vibrational attunement with the cosmos and the Grand Architect. 

You humans are so clueless as to what you are and as to why your DNA was programmed in such a manner to exist as a tangible organism and as a energetic electro-magnetic essence which travels through the galaxy using the ambient energy as highways through ""space-time"". 

Keep searching for answers, keep questioning the obvious, their are forces out their trying to supress your ascension and the consul suggests we not interfere untill you reach your ""pinnacle"". FUCK JUDAISM! Bravo Sooooo... Religion bad... But the industrial age good?

Humans have done more damage to the Earth in the past century than all the tens of thousands of years prior combined--and it's not because of religion that we've desecrated the world. That's for sure. That’s just one article instead of running your keyboard perhaps you should do some research . You can find the studies that have been done, I personally believe you are more competent than you act.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Technology/computer-scientists-prove-god-exists/story%3fid=20678984 Well, since you said so. SMH. Love Is My Religion Im sorry for what you have experienced, but not all religion is the same. Some are misinterpretations of Gods word, and many are meant to manipulate.
Personally i have witnessed miracles, and the existance of God is irrefutable to me, but i know that not all have that luxury.

Anyone who judges you for non-belief when you havent seen the work of God is mislead, as you are only responsible for what you know. Mike you behind most violence and instigation you'll find atheist who would sometime claim that they follow a certain religion As a christian, cool i respect your religion of no religion. Ew Religious riots like this just continue to fuel my atheism. I sometimes feel this entire world is simulation.  

Check the digital world , we all are communicating in digital form , not physical.  


So what's before physical form? 

Spiritual form maybe just my guess . well, bro fuck atheist China and North Korea too. (i mean mao kill count is higher than Ashoka Hindu ruler with maximum kill count).

also, our sun may not go supernova (and become white dwarf).   I believe people should follow a religion but not let it define it as what they are. Zzzzzz boring rehashed opinion. People have been saying this forever, it's not revolutionary, just a boring old take. Get some new material. Religion only reflects the true nature of most humans .....weak and gullible....unable to accept death, or for others, life itself..as stupid as it sounds. ""Which is more likely: that all natural order is suspended, or that a Jewish minx should tell a lie? There has to be an answer to this."" - Christopher Hitchens You sound like a fundamentalist. preach my brother *Sorts by controversial* Preach So you believe a world without religion would be better? What you wrote gives a sense of misinformation. Maybe you're too young to know. 


Anyway, religion itself is a non-issue, humans themselves are vile and exclusive. If you think atheism would solve anything, you're wrong. Look at China, they are atheists. 


Many of the idiotic things that we do are driven by religion but if religion were to cease existing, we will latch onto something else. 


Religion isn't the problem it has never been. Extremism is the problem. People reach these extreme conclusions without proper research or thought process. Facts Sounds like OP is about to lead the atheist religion against all other religions in an non-holy war. How bout people just believe what they want and everyone stops trying to tell/force others what to believe. You sound like someone told you something that you don’t like 😬😂 Religion should never have had ties with worldly powers but in the course of time, it has. In my view, power bestowed to man must not be muddled with religious beliefs. 

Religion got its bad reputation because of the dominance of religious men in power over the masses. 

It doesn't matter what religion you are, if you are trying to tie in power with your beliefs then you're most likely not doing it right. >""Reflect that the dead suffer no evils, that all those stories which make  us dread the nether world are mere fables, that he who dies need fear  no darkness, no prison, no blazing streams of fire, no river of Lethe,  no judgment seat before which he must appear, and that Death is such  utter freedom that he need fear no more despots. All that is a phantasy  of the poets, who have terrified us without a cause. Death is a release  from and an end of all pains: beyond it our sufferings cannot extend: it  restores us to the peaceful rest in which we lay before we were born. ""

\- Seneca, Consolation of Marcia

[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of\_Consolation:\_To\_Marcia](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_Consolation:_To_Marcia) Reading this makes me wonder how even more fucked up an atheist country the size of India would be. [deleted] Religion by itself is not a problem but religious extremism or any kind of extremism for that matter is. 

Similar to capitalism is not bad but crony capitalism is or socialism is not bad but communist dictatorship is or Patriotism is not bad but nationalism is. Currently reading remembrance of earth's past trilogy. It really seems that we need trisolaris level threat and the proof of existence of a dark forest to finally unite as humans and forget all religions. My man :) Well you are close but forgot one thing, fuck humanity. There is no need to do this bs of making world a better place or whatever that means. This earth, science, climate change and all doesn’t really matter. It is a just biological instinct to think we need to save our species, progress and other bs, overall nothing really matters (atleast there is no evidence it does). Humans have propagated this idea that human life is valuable, we should continue reproducing and then try to keep creating societal and economic structures to live comfortably for no reason whatsoever. What about Pascal’s Wager?

https://youtu.be/BlfX9LNrl6E You can't say 💯 percent surely that God doesn't exist..the probability isn't 0 after all.. Faith is not bad. Religion/institution is Just maybe fuck all religion is not the answer? Be an atheist, believe in a God, whatever makes you happy. But be a good human being first. Do no harm as stated by OP. 

The problem with attacking religion so blatantly is that most of the world still believes in something. This is bound to change over time but till then, we can't just say fuck religion and all our problems will be solved. So...ok. What about spirituality? You don't know for sure that everything goes black and we cease to exist. I'm not defending a belief in the afterlife at all, just stating a fact. I had the same feelings as you at one point, I still struggle with it tbh. Yes there has been a lot of blood spilled over religions, but there has also been a lot of good things that came from it as well. A good moral code for ppl at the least. I have my doubts about religion but spirituality is a different thing all together. You are judging this life on tangible things in a world we still don't fully understand. Religion could have helped those sheep herders thousands of years ago to fill the gaps of what they don't understand and as far as we have come since then, there is still so much to be explained through science. No one on this plane of existence right now knows what happens for sure after death. Why be another one that says they know what does or doesn't happen then? That's a little hypocritical. One of those gaps in what we understand could explain what will happen to us spirituality (not religiously)  after what we think is life in this reality is over. I don't think there are definite answers to it, so no one can truly say we go here or there or we cease to be. I notice you left out Scientology. Interesting.  hes a little confused but hes got the spirit You bealive in a lot of nonsense why I can't bealive in God. Actually some of the mass genocide weren't made cuz religion. Socialism have killed more people in the last century. If fuck all religion, then what is the purpose of life?

Why do religigion keep appearing?

Why when people are helpless they’re looking for some being to help them? If you are thinking religion is the root cause for all kind of wars you are WRONG. 

Humans are chaotic in nature just like animals. Humans shed blood even before religion exists. Its just our sixth sense stopping us to do so but its still uncontrollable, in the end human love to war, love to slave others, love to destroy others not belong to their group/race/religion/country/continent/language/direction etc etc etc. all these are just a reason for war, if there is no religion am pretty much sure humans will kill each other for whatever the other reason they can think off. 

In the end it doesn’t matter, who are all died are going to get replaced by new births, its not like humans are going to get extinct, i only see it as a way of population control.

If you are smart enough... like me...
Let them fight and kill each other.
Dont get emotional, dont pick side and ioin the war. Just watch them kill each other. Enjoy this quote will you now 

“The more I read, the more puzzled I was by the order of the universe and the disorder of the human mind, by the scientists who didn’t agree on the how, the when, or the why of creation.

Then one day this student brought me Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. Reading Kant, I began to suspect everything I was taught. I no longer believed in the known God of the Bible, but rather in the mysterious God expressed in nature.

The basic laws of the universe are simple, but because our senses are limited, we can’t grasp them. There is a pattern in creation.

If we look at this tree outside whose roots search beneath the pavement for water, or a flower which sends its sweet smell to the pollinating bees, or even our own selves and the inner forces that drive us to act, we can see that we all dance to a mysterious tune, and the piper who plays this melody from an inscrutable distance—whatever name we give to it —Creative Force, or God—escapes all book knowledge.

Science is never finished because the human mind only uses a small portion of its capacity, and man’s exploration of his world is also limited.

Creation may be spiritual in origin, but that doesn’t mean that everything created is spiritual. How can I explain such things to you? Let us accept the world is a mystery. Nature is neither solely material nor entirely spiritual.

If we want to improve the world we cannot do it with scientific knowledge but with ideals. Confucius, Buddha, Jesus and Gandhi have done more for humanity than science has done.
We must begin with the heart of man—with his conscience—and the values of conscience can only be manifested by selfless service to mankind.

Religion and science go together. As I’ve said before, science without religion is lame and religion without science is blind. They are interdependent and have a common goal—the search for truth.

Hence it is absurd for religion to proscribe Galileo or Darwin or other scientists. And it is equally absurd when scientists say that there is no God. The real scientist has faith, which does not mean that he must subscribe to a creed.""

Science is just as valuable as the non plagiarised scripture is.... to know what is plagiarised what can be trusted as raw knowledge is Upto you , you will find the further you go back the more genuine it gets , if you are not savvy enough to separate the gold from the shit then that’s your problem not mine.. 

Look mate for a start you can’t have much of an idea about the nature of ancient scripture for claiming Buddhism a religion like Islam or orthodox fundamentalism that we see saturating the globe now be alike , I see Tibetan teaching as sacred sciences as do I knowledge of the Jains and Vedic roots in general , just a different perception of ultimately the same things that is of the flip side to the coin - still the same coin though  , how many words I can turn atom into something that’s related to the Vedas like Atman , many examples alike... 

I don’t let religious fundamentalism ruin what was once and still is known , raw knowledge  ; it’s both on a physical and metaphysical level , I relate most of what Vedic teaches to quantum mechanics for example... ""The more I read, the more puzzled I was by the order of the universe and the disorder of the human mind, by the scientists who didn’t agree on the how, the when, or the why of creation.

Two sides of the same coin , each making up eachother 

“The rishis tell us of the galactic center of the universe, which feeds energy to all the galaxies and solar systems of the universe. A modern discovery is beginning to reinforce this belief. To explore this three centers must be identified, 1) the center of a solar system (Sun), 2) The center of a galaxy, 3) the galactic center of the universe. Our focus here will be on the first two centers. In exploring these two centers we will discover the current Hindu principles of Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu at work. Those these same principles can be explored using the galactic center of the universe also.” https://www.boloji.com/articles/1490/modern-black-hole-theory

Doesn’t sound much like a religion to me does Hindu and Jain , Buddhism more like sacred sciences that offers a deferent view point on the same questions , real science does have some sort of faith ....

 I just think you are terribly mislead and have let religious fundamentalism turn you into abit of a hard headed nob head to tar them all off under the same brush like that is one of the most ignorant of things going and ultimately it is you that looses out this man said fuck christian😭😭 who the fuck is christian This comment section is proof that regardless of religion existing or not, humans will still eat the heads off each other over misplaced self righteousness. TL, DR Thing is Sikhism is amazing. It just teaches you how to be the strongest version of yourself. Women are queens Men are Kings. Sikhs have been screwed so many times because it’s just a religion that makes you a successful and strong person. Others religions don’t want it to rise. Sikhs don’t attack first there has to be a BIG reason for them to attack. They mostly defend. beautiful wording but shit man, I don’t want to die staring at the dark abyss for eternity, and for that reason i’m out... What problem you have with Buddhism, bro ?
I know it's your fraustration speaking but just tell me cons of Buddhism, I might get your facts about Buddhism corrected.
Peace. How is this related to India Life never dies on earth 
It reproduces itself
Which is why humans crave for sex so much. [deleted] Ok one thing is not believing in religion which I also don’t , but you fucking fuck head who are you to feed people this bullshit ? I have always been against religion and all the problems it brought us , but one thing I know , and if you had hallucionogetics before you would know better , life it’s not just this , bro/sister if you are not religious it doesn’t mean you have to think that life is just this , make your own mind take your own perspective because atheist is another religion for me and another group of fuck heads trying to act like they know the truth of life lol peace I agree but i think Agnosticism  is more of the solution at least in my case because I do believe in God but that nigga don't give a fuck fr so... and we don't understand that meaning in itself so religion makes not sense cause you cant tell anybody shit about God cause we all know the same amount . P.S. In DBZ King Kai is a God and that nigga lets people die on the daily so it makes no sense to the they care. And i speak about caring cause we are selfish beings so if someone don't care about us we no care bout dem. I bet you think you're a genius for writing this. Like really, what a revelation you are bringing us here I am Christian and I used to believe in the same thing as you, but one thing got in my way:

If we die and that's it, were dead how do we remember now? It's hard to even wrap my own head around, but hear me out, if we just die and that's it how can I remember this moment right now? 

Honestly just a question, not a statement. NOT RECOMMENDED 

Most atheistic society like soviet union who were anti religion as marx said ""reliong is opioid for masses""
KILLED 40-60 MILLION mostly by fast track courts, starvation. 

NAZI's absolutely hated orthodox narratives and set out to eradicate suffering endedup killing 40-50 MILLION. Lol I really disagree with the ‘supernova’ part of your comment. The fate of our sun is to become a red dwarf, its not big enough to supernova. The rest seems reasonable. My religion is rajma chawal. It is totally okay if you don't believe in god but why do you have to talk bad about religions just because you don't believe in it. Religion means to everyone something else and thats completely fine. I just don’t understand why people can’t accept that there are people who believe in God or believe in nothing. Religion is not only about what happens after your death it’s also about many other things. If you are born, for example in a muslim family you don’t have to be a muslim you can just convert to an other religion or believe in nothing. I just don’t get it why you have to hate or judge people who are religious or believe in nothing you should just accept them. My dad grew up in a very religious household and was very religious himself. But as he got older, moved out and got married he started to lose his belief, so it is possible to change one’s belief. I am an atheist/agnostic, I don’t believe in God (a agnostic doesn’t normally cut out the possibility of there being one God or multiple God’s but I personally don’t believe in God) but I think that there could be something after death. I believe in what I can see or in what is already proven by science. Still I think all religions deserve the get accepted and respected. I still don’t get why people hate and judge others by their religion or/and belief. I am very nearly one hundred percent behind you only there is this tiny little voice that whispers that bit from the Bible "" the fool sayeth in his heart there is no God"" but organised religion? not worth a damn Why can't you allow people to have their own beliefs. Why be a cunt so if i say anything about my religion im pushing to down peoples throats, BUT when atheist come here and say no religion is true because of science its not considered pushing your beliefs down my throat?? thats just hypocrisy. Relax dude. Religion is a belief I have no problem with that but saying that I should believe in it too and forcing the principles of religion on us is so fkin annoying While I am a strict atheist, I still wonder if religion is necessary for society or not? A religion does not always fucks up everyone, at its core it teaches moral code. Why do people pay beggars? Do they not feel morally obliged? Religion even creates jobs. Tourism is the main industry here. A religion also is a great tool to keep the masses in checks. How many politicians make religion their chief propaganda? India has a population of 1.3+ billion. But since the majority here believes in religion, there is a sincere moral code that is followed here even by those in the lowest ranks of society. And their reason is ""god will not forgive us otherwise"". 

Thus I think that religion need reformation and modernization more so. 
The main thing that religions need is to burn their texts. Those unscientific teachings completely make every follower irrational. Then it needs to purge the ""dhongis"". There are some very genuine religious heads who teach the right conduct instead of their donation account numbers. And stop mixing politics with religion. That is the worst thing that can happen. Religion is bad in many ways because political leaders will go to any lengths to appease people. 

And frankly, somehow people are always more eager to listen to all irrational things in religions. Remember those glorious tales of Ramayana and Mahabharta. People want to listen to those because it helps them escape reality. 

""People believe people but not necessarily ideals or institutions.""
             ~Yang Wen-Li

Therefore religions are inevitable. But genuine leaders can make religions good. The masses do not believe facts, they believe what they want to believe. The only thing missing is the scientific revolution only began ~500 years ago...which means there is no science *in* those archaic (and current) texts. 
No mention of all that we can see of our universe. You lost me at ""have faith in people"" Why not just let people practice religion if it isn't hurting anyone? Religion can help certain people become better or go through tough times. Only in INDIA Money is also evil. Its actually the root of all evil. It power all politician and religious groups, money also divides us. FUCK MONEY I'm open to criticism on this. However,

Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder? I agree thoroughly with a lot of the points you have made (obviously quite passionately), however to sum up the net worth of religion in society as '' mass murder and hardship'' is quite juvenile and quite frankly, false. Science and Religion are separate facets in social lives that are personal to each individual. All major world religions base their beliefs on pre existing human morals and either give them a narrative or an incentive to uphold traditional moral values. I personally believe a breakdown in faith and lack of belief in the preexisting religious moral institution led to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s and look where that left us.

'' Leave your religion'' - I genuinely hope that was passionate rhetoric rather than what you truly believe. Any anti-freedom of religion country would be morally bankrupt. Freedom of expression and freedom of speech are essential to any working democracy. The same passionate rhetoric in reverse would be condemned by the media as crude conversion tactics. 

Obviously the government should be secular and religion should never be checked in government forms nor in college applications. 

I've definetly pissed off a few people. But rather than shouting slogans and holding a pseudo-moralistic stance, what we need in genuine discourse. You'll start believing them once you experience real paranormal things. ;) Spirits/Souls are true. As a Canadian, I feel that you have a right to your opinion but you shouldn't be criticising people for believing something you don't agree on.

Who cares if this person believes one thing? Accept your differences and move on. 

At the end of the day, we're all human. Don't judge by belief. Hmmm When you say there is evil in this world, you assume there's good. By what standard do you different between good and evil? If we're just matter, there is no evil, there is no good. To have an objective moral law, there should be a Moral law giver. Let me just start off by saying that humans are always looking for idols. This idol has to be a representation of a person. It can be a politician, a teacher, or anything. Indian teens often look at Bollywood celebrities and cricketers as their idols. Therefore, it's a human tendency to look out for idols. However, all these idols are human. When these humans make mistakes, their hard-earned idol breaks. In this comparison to this human idol, the idols of God are the best alternative. They represent perfection, and they can never break. This is because Gods are believed to never make mistakes and always provide the best path in life. That's why people so blindly believe in them.

Now that clear, I wanna say that if you want to break religion today, then it's possible. You can truly break these idols. However, I can guarantee you that there will be something that will pop up in the next 100-500 years. It doesn't have to be mainstream religion like today. Science can turn out to be a religion possibly when we discover some fundamental truth, and we can become so arrogant that we will forget to look at other perspectives except the laws of physics. 

The reason for this permanent existence of religion is not the blind faith of people but the source of order in our society. In the 12 Rules For Life by Jordan Peterson, Peterson brings a compelling argument that in our world, and possibly the universe, there are forms of **order** and **disorder**.  This is the true meaning of the Chinese philosophical concept of Yin and Yang. The popular symbol of the two white and black fishes. The white represents order, hierarchy, cultures, discipline, faith, traditions while the black represents disorder: freedom, innovation, creativity, disorder, chaos, unpredictability, no-rules. What's so interesting is that you can see this duality around you. I definitely recommend you all to read this book. Note that both sides of the model have positive and negative impacts.  So basically, an ideal society is one that has a balance of both. But historically this hasn't been so. You will observe the whole human race making radical shifts from one state to another. When there are too many wars and there is no morality in people, then a new religion arises and attempts to create peace by asserting codes by which people can adhere to. This is a shift towards order. However, with time, the rules only grow and become overpowering to an extent that the religion may appear as oppression or tyranny. Then our society has a rebel who rallies and breaks the religion restoring freedom and free speech. To do this the rebel takes away all the existing rules. But then after some time, with this new freedom, people lose their moral codes.  They take advantage of this freedom and our whole free society turns out to be a blunder. 

The point is that religion or anything in the world is not good or bad. In my perspective, if you promote hate against religion, then there is no difference between you and those religious people who convey the same feelings against atheists and heathens. You are equally as ignorant as them. 

I completely agree that under religion, so many innocents had to suffer. However, I believe that is not true religion. Religion today has become a tool for politicians to sway public support, at least in India. There are riots, arsons, violent crimes, rapes, torture, and so many atrocities committed to defending religion. There are also these so-called spiritual babas that teach ways of ignorance and bigotry.

The problem arises because people feel that religion is told to them. To me, no Godamn retard can tell me what to do, what my religion is! Religious knowledge or spiritual knowledge actually arises from within. You have to sense your soul yourself. A guru only helps you in recognizing yourself. A soul and consciousness may be meaningless to you, and I respect the opinion. To me, the exploration of this soul is aesthetic and worth it.

I believe I'm a religious person. I'm a Hindu. Yet my religion or my own taking of it doesn't force me to hate other religions. Rather I'm quite fascinated by Sufism, and it's my dream to go to the Nizamuddin Dargah. Religion does not make me feel that I matter or that God will come and help me from my misery. While being religious, I just admire the beauty of the world. This is my opinion on it. You can have a different one, and I will respect it. Although, religion is what got us here. To civilization. Whether it is useful now or not is a matter of debate, but humans being the dominant species on the planet is largely a contribution of religion. Religion and spirituality are different. Religion can be more elaborately defined as a way of living or what we call in Sanskrit as 'Dharma'. But most times we forget that if religions did not exist, we would not be where we are now. Religion has played a great role in the development of human civilisation. If one doesn't believe in god, that doesn't mean they should criticize religion. 

We turned religion and culture into communalism. That wasn't the true aim. Lol, did you notice how sure you are off your theory. Everything blacks out.

Do you know that you don't know a lot about yourself and this world.

What caused the big bang, how did life originate, what is conciousness,why are you concious of this expirience. 

That's the problem with atheists,you do not like any religion you just jump to conclusions like others did.

Scientists themselves say that they do not know a lot of the universe and it's still very much mysterious. I think there is truth in all of it :)

And you bet your bottom dollar that the people who run the world believe in religion , very very strictly!

But

There must be something more, evil vs good, dark vs light, hero vs villian you can see this with your own eyes and you can feel it in your guts!

In order for there to be light there must be darkness and in order for darkness there must be light ! It's essentially about being prayerful, that's why you can worship anyone & anything in India cuz it's about our well being. God is just a tool. You should fuck whoever you can wherever you can whenever you can, don't qoute me on tha. [removed] Relevant - https://i.imgur.com/B3AC3bv.jpg I too was 13 once Wow this has gotta be dumbest shit i have seen this month or something Cringe This is a stupidly non-informed post. Anything not explainable with logic.....bam happy tripping [removed] I like this guy. Someone's watching Crash Course Philosophy. Aren’t you becoming the very thing you hate by disregarding what others believe and forcing them to follow your path.

Don’t get me wrong, I know your feeling and like the base idea about achieving a better humanity and way of life by self and mutual contribution.

Wouldn’t the better message be “Jio Aur Jeene Do” why bother what others believe or does as long as they contribute to the betterment of the society.

Everyone wants to vent after what’s happening/ has been happening in our country. I love you for having balls to say this straight. Why all the hate on religion? This is something I don't understand. I was raised in a very religious family (LDS). I don't believe it's true, I don't believe in any religion, but what are they really teaching you? aside from the fucked up history, it's only saying be nice, don't kill people. Honestly, please tell me why you hate it so much? If you say it caused wars, bull shit, men cause wars and use religion as an excuse(BTW, if religion wasn't there we'd still have wars). I'm not on religion's side but hate is the real problem with religion. People hating others due to their religious beliefs is the real problem. YOU are the problem, not religion. Stop the hate and embrace the good principals they teach. I don't see any problem with religious people as long as they don't affect other people in a negative way. We don't know the cause of consciousness and you have no basis to claim the only thing that happens after death is your body decaying. Oblivion might be your belief but shoving it down everyone's throat is your fallacy. We don't know a lot about a lot of things and dismissing age old wisdom is not always the answer. You sound a lot like an edgy kid. Staunch atheism and 'rationalism' isn't the only way to go. There's a lot wrong with a lot of religions but their main shortcoming is the believers thinking this is the one and only way to do things, and ironically you share this trait. Another person talking about something they never bothered to study.  And many people agreeing who also never studied the subject.  Lots of retards on both sides of the fence Lol, OP, does creativity need to abide by logic for you be benefited? If you can't see past the literal to uncover the absurd truth about this existence, then what are you doing criticizing religion? The self righteous woke-ness is strong in this thread Nothing divides us except religion? What a farce. this isn't facebook, go jerk yourself off somewhere else. Wow.  This is the best they could do after reports of anti-Muslim lynchings. No post about human rights just a post about religion being evil. Maybe not kill your minorities first. No offense this is how it starts. the rage. the feeling of powerlessness, that turns good men cruel. when you question one's faith. 

you're no different than the people you oppose.

all people are dumb, it's the universal truth. be it anyone, believer or a non believer I'm not a religious but I pity you for your onedimensional view o religion as a whole.

Tbh you seem like a guy who never educated himself in any religion.
I know the situation in your country is bad but condemning every religion just because of that is wrong man. Religion isn't responsible. It's the people that want their religion to be the best, the only religion. People suck, not religion in itself.

and FYI: Stop calling youself atheists when you are not educated in religion. YES. god damn right! Honestly fuck everyone that's not me. Poor guy got rejected at a Baptist single mingle. Edge Super edgy You’re confused. You described religion the way a child would. It’s not about following certain rules and making sure everyone else does the same. It’s more about community and spreading love. Just because you’re exposed to the violence that is brought about by extremists, doesn’t mean the entire idea itself follows the same mentality. 

Also, who are you to explain what happens after death? Last time I checked, none of us have a clue. So I agree that we should live in the moment and cherish it, because it’s all we have. Just admit that you know just as much as the religious,  because otherwise you’re lying to yourself Lmao losers like this actually exist.

E N L I G H T E N E D. I am not saying that god is real or anything but there are so many things that are unexplained. Like why space exists in the first place, stuff like that. So may be there is a 'being' out there or may be there isn't who is responsible for our creation. They could be some higher dimensional being or whatever. But at the very least they are not bothered enough to make contact with us or may be they don't even exist anymore. Whatever the case may be, to glorify them saying they have a 'plan' for all of us is stupid. People make excuses in the name of religion just to define their own hatred and heinous acts.   


Religion is nothing more but an excuse. Going to need less edge on this post. You are all dumb. I would suggest you to do some thoughtful reading before acting as if you know everything. The book is Homo sapiens a history of us. I partly agree, but religion is probably the reason why the world is as it is now. Religion is what United people, made them work together, think together. All ancient empires/countries/civilizations had religion as their cornerstones, and this allowed people to work and build and think in unity. Read the book Sapiens by Yuval Harari, it's a very good book and explains this in deeper depth.
  Edit: its also the reason the government exists An observation, I've never heard a thiest talk like this. It looks like most religious people tend to be pretty happy and here you are pissed at everything.

If believing in ""stories"" has made them happy and you angry, they reap the benefits of a happy life and you get to whine on the internet. If you only get about 80 years of existence, seems like you're spending a lot of time being pissed. Calm down pajeet This is a really passionate anecdotal that immediately loses the idea of what religion is supposed to be. Death to religion! Sir, this is a Wendy's Love this post. Have been wanting to post something of this sort for the longest time, I’m glad someone did. 
Fuck religion. Religion is one of the main reasons the world is going to shit. Ok edgelord if you want to be down with bad boy, then fuck you too 12 years old is a wild time buddy. Hang in there. sounds like it was written by an edgy 12 year old Cringe

Indias problems are because of indians God damn this OP is just a tunnel visioned fuck talking about ""open your mind"". Religion is a set of principles, the adaptation and interpretation by said sick religious fucks is the problem. Humans are the problem. OP, by creating this post, you are the problem because you're having to voice a disdain for religious people, just to be a judgmental POS. You too, do not know the answer to anything, so please, stfu and keep your opinions to yourself. I do not believe in your god ""non existant"" god or the next persons ""existing"" god, but you dont have a right to say there is no god. That is quite literally an uneducated statement. You're sitting there saying ""there is no god how can you be so stupid, you dont know anything!"" while you look like the complete ass due to not knowing universal answers to anything as well. Its just your sad shitty pessimistic outlook on your meaningless life. Oh well, cya. You’re not just wrong, you’re retarded I’m trying to figure out where I asked for your opinion You said Hinduism. So, I will write about Hinduism, nothing else. I think you have a very superficial understanding of Hinduism as a religion. I agree with your rant that all religions have done till now is creating rift and disruption amongst the people of the world. But, that's just a commentary on the aspect of religion followed by the majority of the population and not religion in itself. 

Religion is not going to temples, not eating beef, reciting mantras, singing hymns, making ashrams, subscribing to gurus and holier than thou attitude. Religion is more than that. There's a beauty to it. The philosophies proposed in Hindu scriptures are mesmerizing and intellectually stimulating. The simple rituals prescribed by the scriptures are nourishing to the mind and body. These are some of the beautiful aspects of religion. It's not degrading, discriminatory or condescending towards anyone. Following the crux of a religion requires no violence or any untoward activity. The philosophies outlined in religion basically provides tools and capabilities for better introspection into our existence.

The question of how and why we are here is the essence of all scientific pursuits. Religion/spirituality is just another way to approach the problem. Thousands of years of spiritual research and development has provided us with tools to understand life a little better. This is an alternative to the approach of going with a blank slate or not thinking about it altogether. It's like scientific research, where the knowledge from the past researcher helps to develop our own theories and understanding about a phenomenon. That's what Hindu religion is supposed to mean, at least to me.

I am a proud Hindu. I will always be. To me Hinduism doesn't mean heavens, Gods, Godesses, temples or prayers. I am in love with the philosophical nuances of the religion. That stimulates my scientific mind and helps me become a better human being. That's my opinion. How ignorant and ironic. Fool Making a Reddit post saying ""fuck you"" a lot and telling people they're an idiot for being religious isn't going to change anyone's mind. You're not the first person to do this and won't be the last. 

Are we really going to tolerate such broad generalizations? I'm not one for religion either but seriously. Religion is not the only thing dividing us. Tribalism will always exist, religion or no.

If someone made a post going ""fuck all gays,"" then they would be downvoted to hell, and for good reason. 

So why is it good for someone to do the same to another large group of people, most of which are ordinary human beings? You might be right and you might be wrong but one thing is for sure, you’re a dick. Isn't *that* a great way to win allies and convert others.

""Share my belief set or Fuck Off.""

Sounds almost- I dunno, religious or something. this site has such a hate boner for religion its actually cringe Wow man you're so smart you've figured it all out by yourself. 5000 years of debating on the existance of the lord and you pking3, obviously the smartest and wisest being in the universe, have found the definite answer in your very insightful fuck all religion post.

Thank you and fuck you in the ass for being an absolute teenage retard. I hope after life is real, so I can shit in your fucking mouth for all eternity. You're right: religion has created tremendous hatred and division. It has caused a lot of death and pain. It is also one of the largest contributors to charity of all kinds worldwide, and one of the greatest sources of compassion for people whom society leaves behind. Whether someone who believes in a religion is childish is an individual issue; there is no rule.

But you know what is always childish? Saying, as you're for all intents and purposes saying here, that in spite of physicists', chemists', mathematicians', and biologists' inability to describe the exact workings of an incredibly complex universe as ours, you alone, one person, understand the exact metaphysical function of life and death. Not only that, but you're so convicted of your unproven premise that you're bombastically contemptuous of anyone who disagrees. 

You sound like a 13 year old who just encountered Richard Dawkins for the first time and wants to be edgy. Sit down. ""Open your mind"", ""religion is the source of hate."" In a post filled with vitriolic language and hatred towards large groups of people.  Sucks to break it to you, but hatred is a part of all human experience, not just religious people and your post is evidence of that. I don’t think saying “fuck all your religions” unites anyone, but ok. Me sO eDgY aNd sMaRT cAuSe mE nO bEliEve sKy DaDdY TIL india has teen edge lords too! Glad that you have it all figured out. That sure is a long winded and overly emotional way to say that nobody matters. So why waste your timing screaming into the universe that doesnt give a crap about how you feel or your views.... Your insignificant, what you think doesnt mean anything. God still loves you though, and we all pray for a change in your blasphemous heart. Because at the end of days is the worst way to find out that all this time you where wrong your whole life, and eternity is a sure long time to burn in hell over an idiotic opinion. I agree misinterpretations of Religion can cause violence , yes it has been used by some to control 
The masses .

However saying that there is no creator ... it’s all physics and science .... is pure bull shit .

We barely know the workings of quantum mechanics , we barely know what relativity is , we barely even know the universe , there are a lot of answers that we don’t have .

There could be a creator , we don’t know what form , it could be a civilisation or a spirit or light . We don’t know 

You just can’t say there isn’t a creator , you could instead say we don’t knowwwww if there is one Did you just turn 13? And who the fuck are you to judge what the rest of the world believes in!! Evidently your the one who is dumber than a box of rocks!! Fuck you. Your a piece of garbage I usually just keep my mouth shut and move on on posts like this because it's obvious that this person has no intention of a discussion they just want to state their belief. I am seriously tired of people like this though. No i'm not talking about people bashing religion, you do you, i'm talking about people who are either slightly smarter than the average person or who found a idea thought of by someone smarter than them running around stating their theories as facts because they have been able to shut down arguments brought to them by people who have not put any major thought into it. Y'all are the reason intellectualism has a stigma.
On top of that the whole reason for ""fuck religion"" is the same argument as blaming a weapon for a murder. People are bad, they do bad things and if you remove the tools they are using to do bad things they will just find new ways. Xenophobia hasn't even been solely acted on because of religion, religions just tend to be the largest cultural groups so attacks between them generally have a greater impact. [removed] Who hurt you, OP? Buddhism isn't a religion. Is science your new religion? [deleted] [removed] If you're truly an atheist, a true atheist in word, thought and acts, then for you there should be no concern at all. Because as per your ideology no one has any choice in any matter as the laws of physics and chemistry coupled with the initial conditions of the Big Bang force people to behave exactly as they do. 

Hence, if you inspite of adhering to this ideology try to comment here, fully aware that everyone is genetically determined, so no one should convince anyone, as freewill is non-existent, and hence getting offended or hurt or disagreement are just illusions of a random oscillation. 

Further, if someone wants to blame God, then first accept the existence of God. Don't put blame on someone that as per them doesn't even exist, cause then they're just an emotionally induced atheist, with their roots in emotion not logic, creating principles of evil or good when such principles don't exist in nature. 

If however, you first accept God and hence you want to blame him then you should ask the question - Why should people not suffer, including a child, a seemingly helpless animal or any other. Why is it that they shouldn't suffer? When the question of evil arises, the actual subliminal question that people ask is - ""Why isn't God behaving as per my desire?"" I want to live forever he makes me die, I want unlimited sex, he creates obstacles, I want unlimited tasty treats, he creates fat, diabetes, I want unlimited intoxication he creates drug trauma, whatever I want to do, he creates problems? Why? It's because a compassionate father not only treats but punishes when you do wrong. And the wrong is not just for one birth, but cyclical, and accumulative, when you keep ignoring it, it grows and one day it just bursts. When the worm is eaten by a cat, then one may think the worm suffered, but scriptually the jeeva soul in that worm got trasmuted into a sperm and then born as a kitten, and so on the cycle continues. 

The desire of fools is material pleasure without any sort of disturbance. Disturbance in enjoying such insignificant pleasure is what is regarded as evil by fools. Death, murder, destruction, disease, and suffering of all kinds is the actual evil and all these evils are sent accordingly by God as per your degree of attachment to such material pleasures. The law of karma works in this way - suppose as per some past act you have to die through a head wound, that karma will make someone who wants to beat someone, who has the desire to beat someone, like a gangster come to you, or you go the gangster, the gangster will beat on the head, and then in the future he too will suffer for murdering someone. In this way one being's desire of beating someone and another's beings deservement both are carried out simultaneously. God will fulfill your desire, no matter how evil it is, one day it shall come to pass, in this life or another, but so will it's consequences. Giving up desires or kaama is the basis of liberation or moksha. Kaliyuga is that age when the pending evil desires of beings is heavily unleashed. It's not God making them behave in this fashion, they want to do it themselves. They like killing babies, they like blowing things up, they like raping and looting, and killing the masses, carving their flesh and drinking till they're dead, and birth after birth they keep suffering. 

Out of all the wars, murders, crimes almost all of them have one or more of these 3 motives - 
Lust, Anger or Greed, all of which are categorically curbed in any bonafide religion. 

Holocaust, Holodomor, The Cambodian genocide of 1975, The Armenian Genocide of 1915, the Zunghar genocide etc. which killed 7 times more people than the two world wars combined have been done by the irreligious. You're doing the same thing which you accuse religion of - Collective hate. 

As for the OP, I'm not here to convince anyone, but to say that please behave as per the ultimate conclusions of your own ideology, which is Atheism here, like a random oscillation with no friends or enemies, with no concept of good or evil, as such concepts are imaginary as per the same logic applied. Please practice such atheism ardently. Also, yeah I post at a sub that many people here are averse to, and yeah its because atleast I can say my say over there. Thank You. These kind of liberals are a threat to society. Who just call out and say everyone is equal culprit and don't take a side. These are the liberals who will send an apology after a pogrom and genocide is done. These are the one that give intellectual validation to the extreme right wing. Under the soviet and communists who are majority atheists we have seen far more genocides and these people have hidden. it very well from rest of the world. China Russia have killed more people in the name of religion

Randia loves these liberals who just wants to put us into the same mess. Will no religion change things for India? Definitely no.

Indias problem lies in casteism. Even if you are a atheist you will continue to look down on people who don't follow your ideas or belief. There are atheists in developed countries but there thinking will never match the Indian casteist thinking. Because in European countries a person can work hard defy his status. But in a casteist society people will always find a way to keep there superiority. You a don't have money but you have caste this makes you superior because you are born with the caste. This gives you reason to look down on those who have money and also those who don't have money.

This casteist mentality should go. Today the mentality is to look down at Muslims as the lowest amongst the society. Very soon this will come to haunt you liberals as well. I believe it's the lack of knowledge about a religion not the religion itself which has divided humanity. from what i believe  religion actually tells you how to actually be a good person

for example: respecting your elders ,teachers,your loved ones.

well according to the bhagavad gita krishna is the universe and when krishna gave the divine eyes to arjuna .what he observed that there were infinite forms of krishna indicating that the universe is expanding ( which is true according to the astronomer edwin hubble).

now in terms of living in the society; Religion also tells about different characteristics of a human being-

1. mode of goodness
2. mode of passion

3 mode of ignorance

now following religion also gives you inner piece (eg; chanting ""ohm"" brings inner piece in yourself   and makes you feel more connected and relaxed).

you would actually understand this when you through some books about religion

but yea there are some negative aspects too and i am totally against that (eg: committing fraud and making money through religion). Saying 'Fuck all religion' on Reddit is like saying 'Nazis suck' to a Jew ( or well, anyone with a brain because Nazis do suck, period.)

But you get my point. It's basically preaching to the choir.

Personally, I am spiritual. Not sure if religious but definitely spiritual. I have seen the capacity of religion and spirituality to do good. Yes, a lot of people-in-power use it for their own personal ends and many corrupt their original teachings but that doesn't negate the numerous truly good religious people in the world.

Faith is a fickle thing. It truly gives some people purpose. And I'm not referring to the ones who corrupt it and use it for violence, no. I'm talking about normal, everyday people who wish to go about their lives being decent human beings.

No religion, by itself, promotes violence, murder or hurting your fellow man ( as far as I am aware). It's a tool that was intended to keep people from turning bad. And tools can be used for both good and bad.

Saying 'Fuck all Religion' is easy to say to an Atheist-majority community. The same way it's easy to say 'Fuck all Hindus' to a group of Islamic extremists or 'Fuck all Muslim' to a group og Hindutva extremists. It's just a different form of hate.

What is hard is actually looking into what various religions offer people and why they resonate with people the way they do and maybe then enter into discourse and understanding. I know u r saying this as u r watching what's happening in our country. When it comes to religion, people of power deceive and manipulate the general public to continue enjoying power. Look at the positive side of religion. I was brought up in a family where my parents r atheists and follow Marxism (As Marx said Religion is the opium of the masses; I agree with the statement) but I became a theist.
Every religion is based on some common values giving up materialism, power, greed and rest everyone knows.
Religion may play a big role in the current conditions of our country but u know anyone who truly understands any religion will give up their worldly lives. There r many cases in atheists have been the cause of genocide, take examples of Lenin and Mao. This is not a matter of religion, religion is just instrumental and a tool for these political goons to unite muscle power towards other particular minorities.
If there is no religion and God specifically we r left behind with the Existential question why r we here?, and any sane mind will never believe we r random product of our universe and the universe cant come into existence from nothing. I have studied years of science and philosophy.

Ultimately if there is no God our existence is meaningless and everything we do is meaningless and the Greatest of humans who gave lives for our country all r meaningless (and I don't think u think so). 
Therefore don't look at the surface and judge things go deeper. 
As Einstein said ""Atoms r easier to break than Prejudices"".

Another one Lol As an indian I’m surprised that India is going through this extremism. We have a booming economy and a booming middle class. That’s supposed to bring the extremism down but the opposite is happening. 

I would also like to say that while you may disagree or hate what’s happening. You have to show that disagreement with respect. Don’t abuse people’s choices and faith. Like someone smart once said. “If there wasn’t a god, we’d have to invent one.” Some people have god and nothing else. If you disagree with religion that's fine, but no need to attack religion like that. Your dumbass is like 100 years late [deleted] Only 2 religions made the chaos on this planet. Fuck Buddhism.  Buddhism is installed by chinese emperors in mongolia to control mongolian population and it did worked in 1910s 50% of mongolian mens were monk who can't marry or have sex/kids and most 50% population had HIV related disease caused by chinese merchants. To say you know nothing happens after death is just as crazy to say you know what happens. I disagree heavily. People can believe what they want to believe. My religion plays an important part in me being a better person, and so do others. We coexist, and that’s okay. Why are you being rude and disrespectful? Religion may divide but it also brings us together. For example, the DL and the pope prayed together. Religion brings peace and order, and if you don’t want to believe in it, that’s your choice. But you have no right to disrespect others for believing in it. If religions are only man made, then all of the ills that you are highlighting are likewise man made. 

It isn’t religions that are the problem, because they don’t exist without *people*. So sensitive, take the tampon out your ass No one asked. How dare you insult many people for engaging in a culture that is important to them? As a someone who studies religion I find it disgusting that you pour all this hate onto peoples heritage and cultures. 

It is true that religion can cause issues, and that some people do heinous crimes whilst claiming to be religous. But you cannot defame all religious people for the acts of the few.

There are atheists who have raped and killed but i would not say that all atheists are rapists and killers. I respect atheism just as I respect theism, you should too. No one fucking cares about your shitty opinion. Why do the atheist say “Lord have mercy” in times of distress? Hey look - someone on Reddit thinks they are smarter than almost everyone who has lived on the globe throughout history and, because it is a simplistic criticism of religion, Reddit upvotes it to the moon.

Must be Wednesday. No, you are wrong. The very action of believing something is real can make it real if you really think about it. Why do you have a problem with what is true to others and false for you? Thinking that your beliefs are true are fair but only for you. Yes there are many bad aspects to religions but they also act as great moral guidelines for people. I grew up Christian but never took anything literal like Noah’s ark. I am STILL glad for what I learned though, because it taught love a compassion towards other human beings. You aren’t wrong or right, but you cannot force you narcissistic black nothingness when you die view on others, just like they cannot force their religion on you. Agnostic here. I don't personally believe in God but I'm open to the idea that there might be something after death...unlike athiests who out right deny all religion.

There's no evidence to suggest that an afterlife exists, but there's also no evidence that it doesn't.

&#x200B;

I know plenty of people who are sick, ill, broken individuals barely keeping their lives together and the idea of an afterlife or higher presence puts them at ease. Going to church and being part of a community of people helps with their mental health and gives them the support they need sometimes. I know plenty of churches who have pastors that go out of their way to help poor families and people physically ill or hurt emotionally, suicidal folks and such. When I was a kid our house in Florida got wrecked by hurricane Andrew and the church came out and helped repaired it, even gave us food.

&#x200B;

You don't believe in God? That's fine, neither do I. However don't be an ass about it and attack people who do, it's childish and just plain discrimination. It makes you no better than a homophobe who lashes out at someone for their sexual preferences. Ok, cool. But mind your business and I'll mind mine. Thanks bro. First off you are very aggressive I can’t really even understand your point when it sounds like your yelling with how you wrote second off yes some religions aren’t helpful some are bad but then there are some that are good even if they may not be true there are other benefits to the people apart of the faith and yes maybe not all religions are without blood on their hands but that is very subjective, Christians have killed people yes but not all branches of Christianity were involved. Times are different no big religion (except Islam) seeks to kill people or hurt them there are many benefits the followers get, it gives them something to believe in and it helps them emotionally mentally and physically with that belief, maybe next time don’t be so aggressive 
(I am an orthodox Christian) Hinduism is not a religion. Its a civilization. Religion is a concept alien to India.

Civilization is something that evolves over time. Our scriptures were written by thousands of people over thousands of years. Parts of our scriptures become outdated with time and new ones were written. We accept that somethings in our scriptures were wrong. 

This means Hinduism is very robust and it is the only one to have  survived the test of time. It is cherished. You spelt steel wrong. *than Yeah fuck people that use religion to keep a positive outlook on life. Such a horrible thing.  Good thing you're on Reddit to tell everyone how bad religion is. Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]? [52:35]


Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain. [52:36]


I encourage you people to read Qur'an, most of people have not read it even lot of muslims, for it is indeed from God Almighty. There were books and scriptures from God before Qur'an but they were altered and changes were made by people over time, but Qur'an is same as it was when it was revealed approximately more than 1440 years ago. May Allah guide us towards the right path. Religion is not a harmless belief, I’m not even convinced that such a thing even exists.  For even if you somehow removed religion from all the witch hunts, inquisitions, holy wars, and so on it still comes with false beliefs.  

False beliefs that teaches that we are born broken beings in need of redemption from god, that we can’t possibly reason without god, that we can’t have a functioning morality without a god, that there’s an in group and an out group and we don’t want to be part of the out group, that we’re somehow at the center of the universe, that we’re better than all of the other created beings, and an infinite number of equally inane and false beliefs besides.

What part of this is in any way harmless? What a bunch of crap. Yeah I lose respect immediately for religious people because clearly you can’t take important issues seriously enough to give it critical thought. And fuck you too! Nobody cares about your miserable experience. Lmfao, edgy as fuck Can’t speak for the other religions but you clearly know dick about Hinduism. While I agree with the point this post is trying to make, I can only counter with this thought:

Religion is there to help the weak feel important. To help the lost find direction. It is not something that I have ever needed, but I understand that some people just can't accept reality. Do I pity them? Sure. But mostly I feel bad for all the kids that get force-fed this stuff for their formative years only to have any semblance of choice removed entirely. I overheard a few religious zealots in Chipotle the other day talking about how they tend to lose some of the kids when they get to about 6th grade as they start to question the teachings, and that they really needed to double down on their efforts to lock down ""harmful free-thinking"" prior to that time in their lives to better increase their chances of extracting tithing from them as they got older. Kinda gross, if I'm honest.

Don't really know where I was going with this comment but here we are. More like fuck Islam. Hinduism is mystic and ethereal with useful yogic methods and philosophy. 

Islam is just a political collectivist cult masked ad religion. Literally nobody asked for your hateful opinion; atheists like you who shit on religion and other beliefs like this actually make me embarrassed to be unreligious.

I wish you knew that religion provides moral and emotional support for those that actually need it. It brings meaning into their lives and keeps them happy. I’ve seen atheists become MUCH better individuals after converting. It’s not just about believing in a God. It’s also about self-improvement.

You’re shitting on it because you think you’re an intellectual superior. You’re not; I guarantee you if you act like this in real life no one is going to like you. 

Actually fucking cringe. I couldn't care less about God and I'm not discussing whether he exists or not. So, what i wanted to say is, the problem is not religion. The problem is within the human nature. Most people are nice and decent because they fear Hell, want a reward after death, or simply fear  getting put in jail. Remove these fears, and all these civilized people will eat each other. Imagine religion doesn't exist. One day, the government makes a public statement that within the next 12 hours, everything is legal. Murder, rape, theft, you name it. What do you think the streets will look like then ? No one cares you are not better than everyone else. Get off you reddit high horse and go back to r/atheism where you belong. Here's the problem with everything you've had to say. Although you don't want to believe in a god, that. doesn't mean you're gonna force atheism on everyone else now. Take Sikhism for example, everything isn't about believing in god, a large majority of the religion just teaches you about respect, honesty, integrity, empathy, and many other characteristics you should have anyways. Your approach is really bad, be an atheist if you want, but that doesn't mean you're going to force it down everyone else's throat. Stopped reading halfway through. I’m not religious or a believer either but I don’t scream at people about it. Nobody has the answers. Fuck atheists. Fuck their arrogant, narcissistic viewpoint that they know what happens after death, an experience they've never had. Fuck their need to embellish their superiority for ""knowing the truth""

Hard to ever convince someone to change with extreme sentiment like that isn't it? Hard to actually strike up a conversation with such extreme views isn't it? 

Truth be told no one knows for sure what happens to you when you die. It's why religion exists, to give people peace of mind over something we have troubles even comprehending or knowing as the experience itself is usually permanent. Some people believe we are nothing more than flesh and blood, spawned here to do nothing but reproduce, pass on our traits, and die. Others believe we are more than just meatsacks and that there is a purpose to all this. Religion at least shows some openness to the idea of spirituality, or at least a willingness to think about and discuss it. Why is that such a bad thing? I ONLY LOVE ALLAH NO OTHER RELIGION, I AM ALLAHIST  First humans didn’t come from Africa mate Buddhism is a teaching not a religion. He was a man, not a god. Do not judge that which you do not understand. You missed an important word .. Fuck all ORGANIZED religion. Just because people us religion as an excuse doesn’t mean the religion is causing those terrible things. Evil people will do evil way whether they have a religion or not. Wow so edgy and deep Atheism is a religion, so fuck atheism as well Fuck you nigga The cringe is real. ye and i will fuck you and your stinky indian mother XD ""This ONE fairy tale, this one is real."" Is how I feel about religious people. well fuck u too bitch This is the edgiest post I've ever seen. Fuck you asshole stupid indian Cocaine is fun but you need to cut back some Fuck you This guy has clearly never done dmt. He also speaks like he knows anything. You dont know anything and your claims as to what happens after you die are unfounded, ignorant, and unresearched. Fuck you, you know it all pseudointellectual twat. Also, inversely I love you and your teenage mind. You're ignorant to believe that. You know how fucking insane it is that's we're even here right now? You know what's more unbelievable than an afterlife? Fucking LIFE. THIS LIFE. You don't know shit, I don't know shit, nobody knows shit except for the ones who have died. Best not to go around being a piece of shit if you can't ACTUALLY back any aspect of your argument up. STFU stupid ass!! Looks at atheist north korea, soviet union, china.... well that did not go well. Cringe You know all these so called facts are merely hypothesis. I know that I for one am genetically a descendant of Neanderthal who were in Europe for at least a couple million years. And those same people had already discovered fire.... In fact research shows that homo erectus could use fire. Cringe bro, all the shit you said is such uneducated garbage, I actually started to believe you were going to make a point that made sense somewhere. It's due to fear of the uncontrollable. Every single human wants to have control over every aspect of their lives, so that they can prevent bad things from ever happening to their loved ones.

The idea that bad things can happen to them, for no fault of their own, with no way to control or prevent it is terrifying to people.

So terrifying that they'll rather believe anything else - including fictional omnipotent beings (god), fictional omnipotent forces (reiki, vaastu, feng shui etc.), karma, multiple lives, rebirth etc.

It's a widespread, unacknowledged mental health problem. All of these people have severe anxiety and fear, and need counseling/therapy. Wow you’re so edgy You’re not an atheist. Your religion is shitting on streets. Well, angry... In all honesty it's great to have an opinion. Although, religion itself has caused nothing, It's used to justify why people murder, otherwise it would have been over other reasons like land, money or power. As long as there are bad people, acts of hate and crime will forever exist. Some people need a beleif in a higher power to help justify a reason to be good, a reason not to murder or steal.

Thank you for reading my crappy comment and have a fantastic day! Wouldn't accept such an emotional speech. Religious people can use emotions againt you too. So much ignorance in one post and the comments below. God (or whatever) save the future of this planet with such wannabe fools. > You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe.

That's literally a part of Buddhism. You can't just lump all religions together because a couple of them piss you off.

I don't disagree with you. I just can't agree with you either. Who cares, fuck you [deleted] So , to anyone reading this one out of thousands of comments . Hey ! I would like to tell you that you matter . Never let stuff get in your head . Your faith is yours , you have the right to practise ,profess and propagate it . Religion is a concept that helps cope millions in their time of desperation and about the blood . People have killed each other over food , do you stop eating it totally ? No , because its a savage (man this word has lost meaning nowadays) humans instinct to kill . And they will believe in any bullsh*t reason to do so . sheesh, op is trying to compensate for a super small dick here so hard it's funny I agree 💯% with you.But here's a little known fact: There was no such thing as religion in the Indian culture. You see, there's no such word as ""Religion"" or ""The God"" in Sanskrit. Hinduism isn't a religion, it's a culture. What’s in it for you? Let people live how they want, no one need to listen to your sorry ass So do you happen to have an explanation of how such a complex universe came into being or do you happen to believe the theory of random reactions causing this? Although it is the most plausible theory for scientists but it doesnt make sense at all to anyone who isn't desperate to find a reason that proves that god is a lie. The way you speak is how a suicidal or depressed person speaks, perhaps it's time you should see someone for it. What did Buddhism do? Pretty sure that whole thing is just based on “This dude chilled so hard once that he he ran out of fucks to give” Jesus fuck, who pissed in your cereal #FUCK U TOO how people are free to type long messeges 😂 I don't agree.

Until today I will never understand why people cannot live and let live because everybody is allowed to believe in what they want and also to practice what they want.

Religions have a personal meaning for every human being and this should be accepted because it is also okay if you think that there is no God and you just want to talk yourself into believing that there is no God. This is also your own opinion which you should keep for yourself and not try to convince everyone as the right one. Although what seems to be right for you doesn't have to be so for the other person. In my opinion a religion serves the people not only to form something beautiful after death - there is much more to it. If you believe there is no God then you feel this personally and you don't have to shout that all this is stupid and nonsense.

I myself am religious, but I also accept people who do not think that way, several people should do it slowly and understand and not rush against everyone. How do you know all this? What’s so bad about having faith? You just look depressed af. There’s no need to knock anyone because they choose to believe in something based on faith. It’s not like religion is the only thing that has caused war in the past. In the past, humans found whatever reason they could to kill each other, the world is undeniably more civilized than it was hundreds of years ago. Nothing is perfect buddy, religion is not perfect. Science is not perfect. Just let people believe what they want to believe and maybe there would be less polarization and less violence in the world, how about that? This smells like a copypasta. Keep calm and carry on. No one would fuck with you for being an atheist in India. But a Muslim friend from India told me, abusing Islam would definitely get you killed. Okay, I think we can have interesting talk here. I know the bible very good, and I AGREE with the complaints you have against what the other religions are teaching about.

Death

 For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all, nor do they have any more reward, because all memory of them is forgotten.  Also,  their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, and  they no longer have any share in what is done under the sun.

  Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might, for there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave, where you are going.  

## Ecclesiastes 9:5,6,10

**Reincarnation Phenomena Explained**

ONE of the objections to the theory  of reincarnation is that the vast majority of people on earth have no  recollection at all of having lived before. Furthermore, they do not  even think that they could have lived earlier lives

Hell

 The Hebrew word *Sheol,* which referred to the “abode of the  dead,” is translated “hell” in some versions of the Bible. What does  this passage reveal about the condition of the dead? Do they suffer in  Sheol in order to atone for their errors? No, for they “know nothing.”  That is why the patriarch Job, when suffering terribly because of a  severe illness, begged God: “Protect me in hell \[Hebrew, *Sheol*\].”Job 14:13; *Douay-Rheims Version*)  What meaning would his request have had if Sheol was a place of eternal  torment? Hell, in the Biblical sense, is simply the common grave of  mankind, where all activity has ceased.

 **The Little Flock**

 Who,  then, make up this little flock having such a wonderful prospect? The  followers of Jesus Christ who receive an anointing with holy spirit. (Acts 2:1-4)  Seeing them as heavenly singers with harps in their hands, the apostle  John wrote: “I saw, and, look! the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion,  and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his name and the  name of his Father written on their foreheads. These are the ones that  did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins. These  are the ones that keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes. These  were bought from among mankind as first fruits to God and to the Lamb,  and no falsehood was found in their mouths; they are without blemish.”​—Revelation 14:1,4,5

Great Crowd

  What does John see? “A great crowd, which no man was able to number, out  of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the  throne and before the Lamb.” **(Read Revelation 7:9-14 We have seen the gathering of millions whose hope is to live on the earth forever.\` God's original plan for mankind**

Religion and War

  Christians  are not authorized to fight against their enemies. The apostle Paul  wrote to fellow Christians: “If possible, as far as it depends on you,  be peaceable with all men. Do not avenge yourselves.”​—Romans 12:18,19

Instead  of sending his followers to war, Jesus told them: “Continue to love  your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you, so that you may  prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens.” (Matthew 5:44,45) Even when the nation in which they live goes to war, Christians should remain neutral, “no part of the world.” (John 15:19)  If God wants his worshipers in all nations to love their enemies and  to remain separate from the world, how could he support either side of a  violent conflict today?

Free Will

 God also gave us the mental abilities, such as the powers of perception,  reason, and judgment, that work in harmony with free will. These enable  us to think, weigh matters, make decisions, and distinguish right from  wrong. Hebrews 5:14)  We were not created to be like mindless robots that have no will of  their own; nor were we created to act primarily out of instinct, as were  the animals.

 Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are going in through it; [ ](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070144/23446)whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it. Matthew 7:13,14

This is why we are different than most because we are on the Narrow road.

. >We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion

220,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki would beg to differ, only if they were alive. What is this hateful trash Hurr Hurr im a edgy atheist hurr hurr. Fuck off. I dont believe in any religions. However, I dont think we can simple say that all religions are bad, the world would be a better place without it.

Bad thing happened with or without religions.

Religions are something happened in human history, fit for the time when they was created,  with their own value and limitation.

They are still alive now, which means their historical misson are not finished. The time has not come. Accept it. Religion without science is blind
Science without religion is lame - Albert Einstein.

Just my two cents. If you cant prove that God exists, you certainly can't prove he doesn't. 

Atheism is in fact a faith. A faith that there's no God.
And sure some really bad things are done in the name of religion, but some very very bad things that happened were irrespective of religion. WW2 for instance, or Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
Downvote if you want, but this is reality and there are a few true atheists, majority are just sheeps following what's cool and after the idea their actions have no consequences. What so ever. Watch what your hatred has turned you into, the exact thing you hated. And I obviously speak only philosophically. The only difference between them and you is that you hate just one more religion than them. If I were to extrapolate your being into a more agressive and affirmative one, you'd be with them with your guns and shooting them both. 
Belief and disbelief are equally harmful. It's not the belief in their god(s) that makes people kill in the name of religion but the disbelief in other's. 

I'm disappointed in you. Fuck ALL religions?

Oh how egalitarian of you.

Ok enlightened centrist.


Edit: please continue to downvote me while awarding centrists. Keep doing that. That's why we are here and why we will stay here for a long time. Even if we get out we will eventually come back to this place. Good work. Nope. Violent people will be violent regardless of religion. There's no shortage of violence committed in the name of atheism either (communists etc). Definitely should be here r/unpopularopinion Religion solves real problems, traditions are smart solutions to old forgotten problems, idk I’m from America so it’s easy to say this, but this is one of the least “speak truth to power” things you can say, you’re on reddit after all, the utter home of atheism. Dude, don't apply the same label of Sanatan Dharm on other ideologies. Or, rather, specifically, Buddhism. Yes, I'm a Buddhist and I claim that you clearly haven't read anything about Buddhism to be whining and shaming the ideology in this manner. And no, Buddhism is not a religion. It's just an ideology. And no, I don't give a penny's fuck about what Wiki says, what Dictionary says. As someone who has been following Buddhism for her entire life, allow me to inform you that it is not a religion. Keep your stupidity away from its name. my sympathies Anyone who thinks religion is made up be it any I am talking about the concept of God or a maker here explain what's 0+0 ?? 🤗😂🤦🏽‍♀️ Yup that's what I thought I entirely agree with you however the deeper question is not what is after death. It is why the universe is here and how/why it was formed. I agree crediting a god for the phenomenon of existence is low effort. Science will ultimately work hard give us concrete forms of an answer. However from a philosophical point of view there are certain questions which will likely always remain unanswered. If time is a construct of the universe being in its current state, what is the universe's true form and can we know it? Where did it come from? Why? These trouble people and I agree that religion takes the mind away from the question and life. Your post was so well written and I hope you'll enjoy this point as well.

^(I want be explicitly clear that I am not referring to question of why an given human is here but rather the universe ) It's clear OP follows Judaism. He didn't mention it. I think I saw this same rant in Ready Player One. I understand that you're pissed, I am too. But blaming what happened or whatever bad happens is like blaming Biology for Coronavirus. 
I don't know if you go to college, office, school, etc, but people of different cultures, religions, regions, etc work/study together. You don't normally see them killing each other over religion. Why do riots happen? Who participates in riots? First analyse the situation, people involved, people who started it or provoked it. 
Look I could have taken offense when you wrote ""F* Islam"", but I didn't because I know that you're pissed and me giving you the finger on the internet is childish. Religious extremism is really bad because it distracts you from the actual religion that you're following. Extremism teaches you exactly the opposite what the message religion wants to convey. It would be more appropriate if you abused ISIS. 
Those people who think that by killing people of other religion is okay will be acceptable by God, they couldn't be more wrong. They will be punished. Everyone's time will come.

I see many comments here who are against religion and calling it a scam. Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong, but I'll say this, you go your way, I'll go my way, whenever we will meet, I'll greet you with a smile.

Jai Hind. op are you okay ? Lol, another angsty teen. How do you know there is no god? Your hate in religion is a religion in itself. Cool your jets bro. You are probably at the lowest part of the social triangle, and you probably deserve it would you look at that ! baby's atheism phase Dumbass energy flows, and time only grows. It would be kinda stupid if there is nothing after life, so all this shit you wrote is nonsense A higher power exists Atheists and misled orthodox are both toxic to the truth if you ask me Brother, I’m a muslim, i may be corrupt but my religion is not! Please stop taking wrong people as the ambassador of any religion. There are good people in all religions! Lmao at the atheist cope. Buddhism is not a religion. Look know angry you are! You realize that atheism is a belief structure in itself, right? 

I used to be constantly amazed with evangelical atheists until I realized this. Lol so you know there is no god. What a fucking joke. What did Christian ever do to you? May Allah have mercy on you. This is clearly coming from someone who is mad all the time and has a sad life. Nothing to see here Fuck Hinduism Hinduism is not a religion Stupid hindu piece of shit with your bullshit rhetoric of hate. You're not any better than these hindu nationalists for thinking exactly like them ""fuck islam"" is the root cause of hate in this shithole country and you come to reddit to preach this. Have some common decency you fucktard As a Muslim reading about what is happening to Muslims in Idia right now, you really want me to believe we are the bad ones? Or I could point out the genocide happening to us in China or the countries taking turns bombing the crap out of the middle east.

But none of that would compare to the evidence that the Quran has to offer about the perfection of Islam. Haters gonna hate. Isn’t science technically a religion? May God open your hearts. “They all just want to believe in something good after death.” 

I think you’re forgetting about the most terrifying prospect imaginable - an eternity of torment separated from God and the possibility of relief from suffering. I suppose many religious believers begin their spiritual journey preferring total annihilation after death to a belief system like Christianity that allows for such a horrific potentially.

The fact of the matter is that you know that God exists. You simply do not wish to accept him on his terms. You want your sin more than the truth, so you rage against God and all who follow him (however imperfectly) hoping you find comfort in likeminded individuals, of which you’ll find plenty on reddit.

That said, we’re all sinners in need of forgiveness, and it’s never too late for a living person to ask Jesus Christ to open their eyes to the truth of his gospel. There is a way to escape God’s judgment, and it is in the person of his son, Jesus Christ, who lived the perfect life you and I could not, went to the cross and died as a substitute sufferer of God’s wrath that you and I deserve, and who rose from the dead, having satisfied God’s wrath against the sin of all who put their faith in him and submit to him as Lord. It’s only then that a person can expect “something good after death.” Fuck atheism. Fuck all of those who do not believe the truth. Jesus Christ died For you too, but you refuse to believe it. You See the truth but you decide to ignore.

Also the reason for most of the wars that were because of religion actually weren't. Most of em came to be because of resources. Religion was nothing but a made up reason. Human is a greedy being

Atheism is evil. Religion is good. But why do you care so much, couldn’t u mind ur own business and just let people live Religion is a belief... as is Atheism. \>  Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension.  

Nope, fuck off. Crazy bastard. Cringe You mad, bro? > Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so

Hey Atheist hypocrites, how about take your own advice. 

> You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.

And stop acting like life matters. Stop complaining about suffering if none of this shit matters. Lolololol

For us life matters and the kind of life we live matters because that’s the ideology we believe in. You tell us it’s all man made. Ok let’s say we believe you. Now tell us exactly how you can objectively prove with evidence that life matters and all of your bitching about suffering isn’t just an emotional and subjective rant. Prove to us with evidence that your morality itself isn’t a product of your surrounding and the times we are living in i.e man made. 

It’s quite telling for a movement to claim rationality by appealing to people’s emotions. How does that work exactly, you know because emotions are biased and subjective. You can't exactly use them to prove or disprove anything. Lol soyboi is mad How about no? Fuck aww wewigion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Iswam, fuck Chwistian, fuck Buddhism.

I don't agree with people calling for religion to be eradicated though because it generates belief and people in times of need and desperation need something like that to latch on to for hope Pro-Atheist trying to convert Religious people into Atheist is same thing .   
What you can do is never bring religion into governance , Keep it at your home .   


Government job is welfare of all people that's it . The main issue is identity politics. How Avicenna ‘prove’ God/Allah/Bhagwan exists

“The full argument is a bit complicated, but here is a somewhat simplified version. Avicenna’s proof actually has nothing to do with design, he doesn’t need the idea that the universe is intelligently put together. Instead, he argues from the idea that the things we see around us are ‘contingent’ or merely ‘possible’.

“The idea here is that a contingent thing is something that may either exist or not exist; its nature does not guarantee that it exists. What Avicenna wants to do is show you that although all the things we experience directly are indeed contingent, there is also something else that exists necessarily, in other words, whose very nature guarantees that it exists.


“To do this, Avicenna points out that since a contingent thing on its own merit could either exist or not exist, it must have some external cause that made it exist - like ‘tipping the scales’ in favor of its existence rather than its non-existence.


“So take me, for instance. I am contingent, meaning that I am the sort of thing that could easily have failed to exist. In fact, at one time I didn’t yet exist, and in the future I will cease existing, that proves I’m not necessary.

“So there must have been a cause, maybe my parents, who brought me into existence. Now Avicenna observes that the aggregate whole of all contingent things – in other words the physical universe – is also contingent. After all, everything in the universe is contingent, so taken all together as one thing, it too must be contingent. Thus it also needs an external cause, just like I do.

“Since that external cause has to be outside the whole aggregate of contingent things, it cannot itself be contingent. So it is necessary. Hey presto, we’ve proven that there is a necessary existent which causes all other things! And this, of course, is God. I think there is a place for religion in our world. However, we are humans first, a brother/sisterhood, a country, a species and all the way at the bottom of the ladder of relevant quantifiers do we find religion. You want to curse organized religion.  The construct of personal religion ( or god for that matter) helps a lot of people get through life. It’s a framework for them to rest their unrest due to the unexplained. 
It’s almost like people never took the science fiction books ( the religious decrees) with a grain of salt.
Then somewhere in the history of time, the organizers solidified their positions and it’s been a shitshow since then
Edit: I personally don’t give a shit about any god. It’s pretty fucking rational and clear to me. The things which I cannot explain are the gaps in humanity’s ability to understand. Doesn’t mean there’s an invisible god out there Is this a copypasta r/copypasta Fuck athiest too /r/justneckbeardthings Dude chill The big bang started out of nothing by nothing, makes sense U really wrote all of this to promote a subreddit 🤦 Who cares ? People have different tastes. You need to chill... Christians saved your country from islam. Might want to show a little gratitude. [removed] That how China survived over 5000 years. Religion is a believe, not a social norms. preaching to the choir buddy Seems strange to me anything exists in the first place, it's just a bit wack. Even with our understanding it doesn't make sense so I like to think theirs a higher power at play, I don't tell people their going to hell or anything like that, I just  like to believe in what I do, i mean if I'm wrong it not like anything bad comes of that, religion has started   to make me a better person so it's not all bad r/copypasta material maybe God is real and there’s proof, sorry I can’t just do what you say and believe when there is tons of proof to the contrary. Go back to r/atheism you cheeto dusted edgelord [removed] Ohh wow a cool progressive person bashing the religion, wow claps claps. So what did religion give you ask? Ohh you dont even ask you just bashed it, again super cool but in the spirit of debating it in unbiased(lol does it exist in debates?) manner let me speak against the motion:

*  **Meaning to Life/Things**: While in todays world it must be irrelevant to most of us but in the past when reddit did not exist and they did not have u/pking3 to guide them through the mysteries of world ,What gave their life a meaning ? What explained unexplainable world to them? What calmed their curiosities , what prevented them from going madand just live like a hunter gatherer always without any other purpose in their life?  
*Downside*: *While it soothed the basic nature of humanity to question things and move forward to other things, it arguably might have might slowed down the development*, but slow and steady wins the race, it was more important that they identify themselves different from animals rather than estabilishing error or noise corrections in the quantum computing and harvesting its quantum entanglement property. Remember how you are first told that sun rises in east in 1st class rather than how the combined result of rotation at tilted axis and revolution of earth around earth gives you days and seasons. I bet you still dont know basic science of why seasons exist, but that is not the point yes sorry.
* **Identity:** Next is giving them an identity, it was required to provide more stability to their life. What provided trust among two random beings at that time? *""Ohh hey bro! I see you are from Meet nagar in Shahdara as well which is thousands of years yet to be, me too, lets grab some beer*"". Trustng each other was the first step towards to give rise to settlements and what promotes trust faster than having same school of thoughts   
 *""Hey bro I worship nature""*  
 *""Ahh i see you are a man of culture as well, join in! Loot us later we are yet to have NRC to ascertain your full identity""*  
*Downside: Ohh you understood already, as population grew , clashes grew on whose imaginary friend was better at protecting them while they died more because of him/them.*
* **Development:**  While necessity is the mother of inventions, who is the mother of necessities? Yes! The competitions, the wars.   
*""Bro i am oldest religion, we have paper manuscrpits and shiz""*  
*""But do you have weaponised stones bro?""*  
*""Bro now we do""*  
*""But but do you have metals and shiz bro?""*  
*""Bro now we do""*  
*""Bro do you have RDX and ammunitions bro? ""*  
*""Bro now we do but bro do you have papers now?""* ..... Only change is it is no longer for religion but for region now. Religionism gave rise to crusades and we had wars anyways without religion reasons as well. Wars are terrible, but they put science on warp speeds.  
*It took 1900 years to find electron in the atom but 50 years to perfect it to ruin the prefectures with Nucleur bomb.*  
*Again it took 1900 years to make the first flying thingy and just 10 years afterwards to make it fight worthy in WW1, or 50 years to reach moon.* and many other examples  
Religion gave rise to groupism which gave rise to competitions which gave rise to development.   
*Downside: No need to repeat*
* **Moral Policing/Accountability:** While cinema is witness that no one left someone ""*Bhagwaan ke liye*"". But then what have made masses to conduct themselves in order within themselves? Who did they fear before our hero u/pking3 came here to spread truth. Somewhere in sometime BC  
*""Bro no one pleez steal it behind me""*  
*""Why bro wathcu guna do""*  
*""Well I have 24 x7 CCTV surveillance, and i will submit it as proof to Police/CRPF to whoever necessary and they will punish you accordingly""*  
*""Huh?""*  
*""I meant God bro, god is all watching and all just""........*  
*Downside: Moral Compass seemed to break during wars with others, this is not a fault of religion though but the followers. No religion asks you to wage war unnecessarily ( i want my comment to stay and not get removed)*
* **Teaching How to Live:** Religion gave us a sense of wrongs and rights, dos and donts. While most of it helped,  few are useless in todays world yes. It prevented human beings from going back to uncivilised culture. Spread harmony ( atleast within the religion) . Gave people a space to grow. Defined a set of rules of conduct, became the parent to parentless, teacher to teacherless.   
*Downside: Regressive rules, few wrong teachings or wrong interpretations.*

There are more reasons but 5 points suffice.  I tried to stay away from religion while pointing these. I agree there is a lot of hate between people now but then Development/ Science can only come after religion whenever Earth is restarted. Fact that you can rant about it now is beacause it helped you and your civilisation to reach this place in the first. It is not all harmful the same way as Science is not all useful. Make everyone atheist and you will see people forming religion again because until Science explains everything, religion will exist. Religion is not religion it is snyonym of hope and beta ""Ummeed pe Duniya Kayam hai"" Wait til you find out why you're just mad, and there is spirituality out there that isn't toxic. You dont really know what happens after death same as religious people. 

Religious folks and atheists are two sides of the same coin as far as I'm concerned. This kind of cringe ngl Yes, a world full of atheists will be truly perfect... LOL. Humans will be humans regardless of faith. Either do something good for the planet or stand out of the way of people that are. Hinduism is not a religion. Your argument is invalid BTW atheists have their own “religion”... Get a grip dude! Seriously, some therapy, a glass of wine maybe? Some weed??? I dunno????

Dilip Ghosh, this is the same moron who said Desi cow milk have gold in them. Good. Hope their God protects them, if not, then *insert shrug emoji*. Agreed that BJP is flawed and not perfect (no party is), but why does r/india always resort to Modi Party bashing? 
To the best of my knowledge, I've not come across any post appreciating steps or courses taken by the government towards people's welfare.
Incessant dissent towards everything done by the Govt only lowers reliability of the accuser. I don't know why we are painting BJP as dumb people here. Religion and faith provide good fallbacks when science and technology fail.

It's very normal for people to turn to god's when perhaps science and technology seen incapable. It's a very common human feeling to seek comfort in belief in God or technology and when we feel abandoned by one we naturally gravitate towards the other.

I don't see why this very human stance taken by these people needs to be put up as a BJP stupid meme.",2020-03-15 10:38:29

-_- Indian Cow NUMBAH 1!!

> Buffalo will start giving milk on seeing any buffalo calf or a statue of buffalo calf 

This is gold, OP. Nice find Is this a sarkari institute? Is my tax money funding this? Is not having sense of honesty means taking thousands of crores of  'loans' from banks and not returning them back. Damn you buffalo.  'Has Surya Ketu nerve to prepare gold minerals'

DAFUQ!? Some other propoganda from this site:


Fresh cow dung kills bacteria that cause malaria and TB. Cow dung is used for protection from atomic emission. Cow urine contains copper which transfers into gold in human body. Gold has power to destroy all pathogens. Cow urine also contains iron, calcium, phosphorus, carbonic acid, potash and lactase. It contains 24 types of salt and several useful medicines are made from cow urine.

> SSIAST Trust **in collaboration with National Institute of Plant Health Management** jointly makes significant contribution to promote environmentally sustainable plant health management practices through **training and research** for the developmental activities **to enhance the knowledge and skill of the volunteers and progressive farmers**.

> **The National Council for Organic Farmers, Govt. of India has approved SSIAST, of The Art of Living, as an authorized Regional Council for certifying our farmer groups with the status of Organic Farmers**, under the PGS system. SSIAST will now be able to **train farmers** in the Govt. of India's PGS (Participatory Guarantee System) and **certify them as such**. Who knew Indian cows had so much honesty. Maybe we can elect a cow instead of Modi for next term. Buffalos are a new minority now. Smh Fucked up part is that many would agree that this is true. We're fucked right to the core of the country arent we? Barring a few patches of sanity which involve less than 10% of the country, this is what the rest of India is like isnt it?  bhains = tan kaalaa aur man bhi kaalaa Looks like his videsi gai left him for another guy.
His desi gai stayed though What's the criteria for being declared honest? Shouldn't it be said as racist... Poor buffalo's being discrimated ...  As I veterinary student, it is my experience that the opposite is true in almost all the points. Exotic breeds have a friendlier temperament than indigenous ones, while also having higher production and better feed conversion efficiency. Local breeds are much more aggressive and a nightmare to treat.
And Buffalo milk is much better suited for making products like ice cream, butter, etc due to more fat percentage while buffaloes themselves are more disease resistant in general, and cleaner as they have almost no hair and love bathing in water.
Also, there is no 'surya ketu' nerve. Well none that I've ever read about in any anatomy textbook. M.Tech. Gau Rakshak Last 3 points for buffaloes are sketches of Bollywood villains. Lol at the milk point being mentioned after a statistic on the intestine. UNSECO has declared Indian cow (Gaumata) as the best in the world.

FUCK YOU FIITJEE. It's a shame that we don't have laws governing who gets to use terms like ""University"" or ""academy"". >FIITJEE

Fuck IITJEE
 FIITJEE is the most fucked up institute. Their math books start with equations. Like wtf. They know how to make simple things tough. They produce top rankers only because of large enrollment numbers and a handful of south Delhi teachers. I remember last time they referred 'Ram Rajya'.
Edit: I forgot about their mentions in Paradise papers. And yes these Institute do not teach science. Science is not sitting in a room and solving questions for two long year. Krishna killed a bunch of people after lyying to them. I doubt he gives a fuck about shit like poaching faculty. नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः ।

उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः ।। Salem Hypothesis - People who believe in God(creationism) and are men of science are likely to be engineers than Scientists.
 If I hate this ad... Will I go to hell ?  +1 on fiitjee is cancer. Studied there full time for 2 years only to realize that my time and self confidence was wasted Meh, its advertising. End of the day they will still teach science only Its a private company, it can do what it wants, right? People can just choose not to go there. The ad is deplorable. But Fiitjee is way better than narayana and chaitanya. Atleast where I studied. We live in a 1.3 billion society where 50% of the population is under 25. Blame the competition and lack of resources to educate the students. Peer pressure just adds depression into this primordial soup. 

When I studied in fiitjee (did not clear iitjee but got into a well known college) . There were no extra classes and we were taught Just the subject and given phase books. (8 phases in 2 years). You get into a good college if by yourself are motivated to study harder. Peer pressure kept us on our toes. Their material is good. More importantly, I learned to practice self-discipline. Something that was very useful when I entered college. I saw so many burned out people in IIT tanking their GPA from other  pre-university institutes.  Dude every iit jee Institute is like that all are fuckin pricks and sometimes even teachers are racists  Kalyug isn't an *idea*, it's a cosmological time-frame described in the Vedic literatures.

Science/Technology,One of the good effects of lockdown is that air quality has improved a lot.,56,friwew,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/friwew/one_of_the_good_effects_of_lockdown_is_that_air/,31,"One of the positive effects of lockdown is that air quality has improved a lot and pollution is going down.

It should be noted that worldwide more people die due to air pollution than what the covid19 has claimed till date.

While we have been very serious about tackling the virus threat we have literally done nothing to tackle the air pollution threat which claims more lives.

Let us all support reduction of pollution be it air,water or soil.

Edit : I am using technology to put my thoughts out to everyone. I am not anti science or anti technology nor development, rather my point is currently whatever we are doing has been causing more harm than good. So let us strive to make more informed choices in future be more wise , make sure we try to change tracks for cleaner technology.

Maybe consume less, support clean tech., work to clean out rivers and lakes, plant more trees and not cut them ,use less plastic ... there can be many small things we can start with and go forward.",manofsteel911," Humans are the cancer Dude yes.

I start panicking when I read the damage done to children's lungs just by living in Delhi and I have to distract myself from thinking that because it's frankly depressing I'm pretty sure in the long run pollution would have caused more death than the virus. God knows how many cancers have been caused because of us not respecting the environment. Maybe the world can initiate a movement to hold a weeklong (or two) lockdowns annually so as to give nature a breather.   
We can also use this time for meditation and reflect on our lives. Operation success.

Science/Technology,"Scientists of India, ministry of science and technology wants you for research on Yoga & meditation",95,70mzlx,https://imgur.com/NF5ee1Y,23,,pakaomat," [deleted] Though myself vehemently oppose the zabardasti ka superior kulcha line. I have no issues with proper scientific research done to prove the benefits or ills of said kulcha.  The only problem I see is that the research will be done in a shoddy manner and hence be a waste of money. This is actually much needed. There are so many neuroscience studies on the effect of drugs, videogames, sex, tv, facebook etc on our brains - but different forms of meditation are not as studied. Each one would yield different results. It's time these were scientifically scrutinized.

 The only question is whether unsatisfactory results will be allowed to be published. > SATYAM

This government sure knows how to spin creative acronyms. Very welcoming! We should do more research on this rather than Harvard or Stanford.
There is a lot of research that these two institutions do inspite of yoga being an Indian thing. We should try to match them. Where's the problem OP? There are already many international universities researching the benefits of meditation on the brain. Why shouldn't India do it? Don't expect me to spit on something just because it's connected to religion and you have problems with it. *Disclaimer: If the paper shows yoga and meditation have no major impact on health The Truth Ministry will make sure the researcher get Vyapamed™. Please read the terms and conditions carefully before applying. BMJK. OP you are a scumbag.

Stop dissing on Indian culture and arts just cos they dont fit your worldview, you goddamn pseudo-secular self-hating commie fake-liberal fake-scientific thinker. I dont mind the request from the ministry , what i worried here is how much of these research are going to be genuine , as there is more chance , few of the research later on can be used by this govt to support yoga and meditation being implemented ...like say while watching a movie in a theatre...

At 30 years of age with no set path for a career, I am utterly useless. I can't even provide for myself, let alone take care of others.

I am a 30-year-old, so-called general category lower-class family, man. Haha, how pathetic, isn't it.

&#x200B;

I was a good student till Xth, and then the slow downhill started in my scores. Struggling to pass 12th in state medium with 70% with just pass 50% in mathematics.

&#x200B;

Then, coming from a lower-class family, there were not enough choices for me to go through - either Medical or ENgineering. I prepared for Medical taking a 1-year gap. Nothing substantial came out of it. In the end, I had to go to engineering. Because sadly, in our country, gap years are a strict no-no for any of the stakeholders and I could not waste 1 more year.

&#x200B;

Did [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in engineering in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation from one of the 'good' private colleges in Bhubneswar, Odisha. Yes, here in Odisha - so you might have guessed my economic conditions. Passed with Average CGPA of 7.1.

&#x200B;

No jobs came in the engineering field. At last, I was recruited by the service company (name starts with I) and had to go \\ for it.  This was 6 years back.

Why?

Because there was no alternate way for me. I am now the sole bread-earner of the family. My dad has retired from his job.

Trained in Mysore - I was not from a programming background. I found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters. I had to take a retest for the final exam since I failed in the first one. In the retest, I literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers. I passed with a retest with minimum pass marks.

GOt posted to Mangalore. Here, literally at the opposite side of India from where I cam from - I felt alone. Loneliness became my best friend. I avoided getting into any projects there -  be it support or development. Because I knew in my heart that I could not do it.

After a gap of almost 1 year there, I was forced by some managers into a support project. In this team, seeing my utterly bad skills, they put into a 1st level support person - a triage one - someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers, records their issues, creates incidents, tickets and passes onto other teammates. Literally this for 1 year.

Then, slowly they put me into an application support where SQL work along with a niche technology called TM1.

Being absolutely weak in any other technologies, let alone niche technologies - i could not really improve upon my situation.   Thus, they kept me in a bare minimum work state in this one too. because frankly I could not doa anything else.

I remained in this project for 4.5 years, then took a transfer to Bhubaneswar. Here, I avoided again, getting into projects for 1 year or more and then was again forcibly put into a support project where Informatica, Unix, TM1, Cognos is being used. I am in this one, at present.

HEre as well, seeing my lack of skills, I was put into a bare minimum level. My lead has literally scolded me so many times that I have become numb.

Below are not excuses or points to validate my inactions - they are just plain naked truths.

NOw after all this, you and hell, I would have asked myself -

what I am doing about it?

What I am doing to learn new skills?

What am I doing to even get into another job?

The answer is nothing. NOthing.  Why?

because I am listless.

I lack the memory right now to retain anything at all. I keep forgetting common things or points let aline study and become proficient in a programming language.

I lack the logical reasoning a person has to learn to actually code.

I lack the mathematical skills.

Now would you believe me if I told you I had scored 100/100 in my Xth Computer Science exam - consisting of OOPS, and Blue Java.

But now, I know what utter waste was that - not worth 2 paise in India and in this hyper-competitive world.

&#x200B;

Since these 6 years now, I have remained severely depressed with OCD patterns coming in as well. My memory has faded. My enthusiasm is gone for anything. Nihilism in my mind. I have tried to come out of it - I am not saying this lightly. I have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for a person to get some enjoyment - songs, podcasts, movies, etc.. But nothing works. I, after doing any of this, feel an existential dread as to what I have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to a movie or hearing to some podcasts. Guilt-tripping at its finest.

Sometimes in the middle of a day, I see something or think of something and I break down. Tears and only tears even on a bright day. At night, tears are my only friend.

You might think, where are my friends or family who can help me. The answer is I really do not have any such friends whom you can call at 2 am and speak your sorrow and get a shoulder to cry on.

My family, well - they had high hopes for me. My dad and mum had put everything to get me a good education and now I am in such a state. They are slowly coming to the conclusion that I am an utter failure.

My lifeline has been shredded by my inactions, my lack of skills, lack of intent to improve my situation. And now, too much time has passed. And I honestly don't see any point in it.

Sometimes I wish in my loved one's mind, I cease to exist - their memory of mine being faded in an instant - so that they do not have to go through the pain which they would feel when I take away my life.

What a sorry, pathetic, selfish piece of shit stain am I? You are thinking this, aren't you? Yes, I am that. I am all of them and much more.

But there is literally no way to go on any further for me. I do not see any career paths for me, I am not good at anything, I lack memory, I lack any interest in any field to be proficient in.

All doors are shut for me now.

Today while walking down the road, I suddenly wished what would happen if I just walk right into a front of any ofo the trucks which are passing by.

At least people would be spared seeing such an utter wastrel of a being which I have become to fall down further.

Thus, I have prepared everything to end it swiftly - I have put nominations with my mother's name on it for the 1 account I had. I have everything which they would need in one email - which is just waiting in my drafts to be sent.

I have written my goodbyes to them and prayed to them - they please forget they ever had a son. To erase my memories. I am written my farewell to my loved ones.

Now, thank you, dear readers, for going through this post. You have empathy and I pray for it to grow in your heart.

Bye.",Snoopyrun," You seriously need counseling. These thoughts are no jokes. 

What really blows my mind is how our lives are similar yet different. 

I didn't get any decent job for about 2 years after I finished my B.Tech. When I got one after a year or so my company decided to close the unit and everyone lost their jobs. 

Then I started to teach few students and decided to try for government job. Even cleared all the exams but failed to get into final selection list. 

Then I joined another company and there I got into an accident. 

I severely damaged my arm and doctors told me to avoid heavy work for at least 2 years later. I took few steps back and started to teach in a college as a part time assistant lecturer. 

Even after all the bad luck I never felt hopeless. 

I am still in search for a decent job but I always try to be optimistic. 

I recommend you to get professional help before hurting yourself. You sir, are not a failure. You have managed to persevere till this day even with the constant downs in your life. Better things await you in your life from here on. 

Try getting a professional help as I have heard many people here saying that it really helps. And lastly don't lose hope. Please dm. We can talk. I can totally relate to the post. Don't take this step and take some counselling ASAP. You should try giving highschool students English tuitions. People from small towns will pay good money. Your writing skills are really good. You don't even need a degree to open private tuitions. He is not responding to any of the posts here.....I hope he is alright :( There's millions of others who share your story my friend. Even worse situation than you. Also think about those illiterates ones as well. You know what those illiterates would say to you "" Atleast you are educated, one day or the other you will find a job, whatever it will be, but for us there is nothing else."" 

I'm not stopping you to feel frustrated. But it has no solutions. Saying goodbye here won't change your life soon. It will always be a struggle and even if you find a job, the struggles won't end there. You will be forced to drop all your morality and education into the gutter when situation arises you to do things against your policy and wishes. Cuz then you would call it survival for the fittest.

What you feel right now won't be the same in the future. You have to understand this is real life. You will face this situation when you feel completely lost and in vain. Happens to the best of us and even to the worst. 

Without giving my old cridentials, I'll tell you I used to Manage a floor of 300 employees worldwide. Now for the past decade I work at a local wineshop as a manager. My team consists of uneducated asswipes who steal and behave as if they are hardworking fellas. They think I'm a fool, when I know every angle of their stealing from the shop. But I stay silent and cover their ass cuz they really are hardworking fellas. So do I feel sad that how my life changed, yes. But is it worth it, definitely not. I realized my circumstances and did whatever I could find to survive. Sucking up my standards and ego. If you can do that, you are a winner. 

All the doors aren't shut like you said. Because even I thought all the doors was shut 10 years ago, when I was at ICU battling for my life for 3 days. After 20 days in the hospital, I got discharged with an heavy bill and payments to others. Almost lost my home and family back then. Suicide was the only solution for me. Because my ego didn't allow me to accept failure. Now, I'm here replying to you like a future. Think about it man, 10 years ago, I was you. And I wasn't lucky, it was worse even after backing out of suicide. Nothing changed, I was still the same frustrated man. But there's something called as TIME. it changes things man. It really does. For every living beings. It's the law of the nature. 

You can be anything, only if you want it to be. It is the only truth. Dude, firstly stop whatever you are planning to do.

Just read this thread, one of these suggestions might work for you.

Secondly, don't relate your worth with how much you wealth you have, or even how many friends you have. Remember, at the end of the day, we have to save ourselves. 

So please take care of yourself. Start doing things you like.

Don't like anything? Think about yourself as a child, what were your dreams? What did you like to do? Do that. Watch the clouds, breathe the air, go to any park, sit there. Look at nature, feel that you are alive. 

Listen to your heartbeat. Put a mirror in front of you and cry your heart out. And keep looking at yourself, tell yourself ""it's okay to cry, it's okay to feel down, but this is not the end of me.""

Call your parents, talk to them. Ask about their day, just listen to the sweetness in their voice.

Eat whatever you like. Think of all the good food that you like, go buy some fruits you like, eat that.

Get a new haircut, dress yourself nicely. Go for runs in the morning, exercise or play a sport.

The idea is to keep your body moving, do things that you like, take care of your mental health and tell yourself ""it's okay, it's okay to feel down""  this too shall pass. [And it's not your fault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQht2yOX9Js). 

Take control of your life! Live! “Man’s search for meaning” by Viktor Frankl - PLEASE read this book. It might give you some encouraging perspectives on life. Please don’t take any impulsive decision. You are strong!! Hi, PM me. 


My fiancé said he will find you get a job in his company, if that’s the issue. We could help you out financially if that’s an issue as well. Whatever you need, we’ll help you. I’ve already lost a brother to suicide, I will absolutely not let you do this. 

PM ME.   We’re here to talk to you. 


Don’t be dumb. Don’t do this. 


Reach out. I’m here for you. Buddy, you should hone your skills in some other field when you have the free time, even if it doesn't reap any financial benefits. Reading this post, I feel that you should give writing a shot. Just because you do not have the skills to do well in one isolated field does not mean you are useless. It is a very childish reason to feel any sort of guilt. Hope you see things the way they really are. Have a good day. [deleted] This is the state of mind of all non successful IT guys, trust me I have seen few of my useless colleagues getting 2x package jump in new companies and I am still at the same company , it feels bad to see non talented people getting good jobs, but life is that way , just be happy with whatever job you have , just don't compare yourself with the guys getting better pay, compare with those who don't have job at all Hey man. Life is a long marathon. You haven't even completed the first set of laps. It sounds like you have a job but you're not motivated at it but you don't want to quit just yet and try a career change. That's fair. Why don't you throw yourself into learning something relevant to your career? Go back to the basics and re-learn things again. You'll be impressed by how much you've learnt that you've put into practice. There are lots of free courses out there.

It also sounds like you are having a difficult time at work. We don't talk about our emotions often in India. Why don't you ask your team lead out for lunch on a weekend or something? Say you have something important to tell them and ask them to meet you outside work. Be honest and tell them about your challenges and your hopes and ask them if they can help you in any way. You would be surprised at how people react to honesty. Frankly, it might make the person relieved because it's much easier working with an existing employee instead of finding a new one and training them from scratch.

The other thing that seems to bother you is the fact that you seem to be the breadwinner. If that's the case then why don't you have a discussion with your Dad and figure out how much the family needs monthly so that you don't stress yourself out by thinking you need a much larger sum than what you actually need?

All in all, it sounds like you're aware of your problems. That's a good sign. Never underestimate the power of self-belief. You just have to do better today than yesterday. Friends are not disappointed in you and they don't want to avoid you. They're just waiting for you to reach out. Hey, yes you! Listen to me dawg there’s nothing in this world that’s not achievable and I mean every word of that sentence. I think it’s right to tell you that I know how you’re feeling and what you’re going through as I was in the similar situation just like this where though of taking my own life also struck my mind. Everyone around me thought that I was an abomination but little as they knew, they’re the same people telling me what a change I made in my life towards a better future. I know what it feels to have no friends or family to talk to. I was an introvert too so making new friends seemed far too unlikely.

Let me tell you few changes you need to start making in your lifestyle starting now to achieve the set goal. And remember these are just baby steps which will make you feel good about yourself and think positive.
1. Always go to bed before midnight and sleep at least 7-8 hours every single day.
2. Wake up, jog for half an hour, get back take a bath and have breakfast.
3. Go to work thinking what an amazing day it is and do listen to few melodies on the way.
4. Start from basics and learn your way upwards. Never think what your companions might say or do.
5. On your way home from work stop at some local market and get some fruits/vegetables for you and your family.
6. [MUST] Visit nearby temple of whatever religion you believe in and spend an evening there daily.
7. Meet new people, have a little chat about how their day was and tell them about you.
8. Get home spend time with your family, have a dinner together if you could, watch some TV.
9. Attend social gathering as much as you can.
10. Never be alone, be with someone always.
11. Don’t drink/smoke/drugs. Never become addicted to something. Try once or twice but don’t let it consume you.
12. Stop binge watching TVs and movies, I used to do that a lot and it just ends up wasting much time, Haha.
13. Last but not the least, never stay at home in your spare time. Go out wherever you want. Just be outside. Do whatever you want. It helps to cultivate your mind for new possibilities and improvise.

God Bless you! You have an amazing life ahead of you waiting for you to just explored.

P.S. If you ever need to talk to someone about anything don’t ever hesitate to message/DM me.  Before you take any steps, please teach out to a counsellor. Just as a last effort. I can understand the stagnation you must feel, but know this a lot of people are in the same boat, including me. I am 36 and as lost as I can be. I dont want to pursue my earlier career path and have been unemployed for depressing long. No idea what I want to do anymore. I know the feeling when at night you think that you were simply not to wake the next day, it would be no loss to anyone, including yourself. Please, please reach out to a counsellor. Man if you change your decision (I think you should) try to understand not everyone is going to win the race somehow my parents taught me this very well and I have learnt to be content of what I have even before I started graduation.
You are just looking for happiness in wrong places.
Quit everything go and talk to old monks and use your physical health to help in whatever way you can.
What is stopping you? You might stay poor for the rest of your life but you will be a 'Brave poor' ending your life is only gonna bring more misery to your name and your parents.

If you really care about them do something with your life.Literally anything trust me deep down all parents just want their children to be a good human being over being rich.

Trust me if you are not doesn't mean you are a coward.I agree some people are born intelligent but that doesn't make you a coward.You have to develop the will to fight by yourself.

And I ll say it again not everyone is destined for being rich and all.If you're not succeeding in your life then you are just going on a path which is not yours. Try and be optimistic my friend. Start changing one thing at a time. Damn. I felt that hard. I'm doing medschool and I thought depression was not that big. How utterly wrong I was. 

As suggested by many about counselling. Go for it. What you'll get are anti-depressants and good sound advice. That'll make you better.

As for finance, now that you won't be listless enough (anti-depressants and mood stabilisers kick in in about a month) you can start developing new interest in your work.

Once you are out of it, as a 30 y/o, you'll have a lot of experience. Use it to start loving your job. Or finding new one later on. 

Don't be too hard on yourself. You are educated. You'll do fine. Hi, I'm really sorry you're going through all of this. Please please please consider going for counselling/therapy. These are signs of depression. And it's no joke. You're not being pathetic at all. As someone who was once in depression, I partly understand how you might be feeling. But therapy really really helped me.

Please consider going for therapy. DM me if you want to talk. Take care. Just saying these same things to a psychiatrist could help immensely. Right now, the thoughts have overcrowded and want to be let out
Always remember these words ""nothing is permanent but change""
 
Believe me, if your head is clear,  the solutions will follow. Maybe you've neglected your wellbeing until now. That needn't be the case henceforth.
Life is learning. And the initial stages are difficult but essential for growth. If you just seek for help, youd be surprised how others are willing to help you. You dont need the whole world to care for you to get out of your rut, you just need a few good ones. 

Please seek help for the sake of youself and for the sake of your near and dear ones. A good you, mentally,  emotionally is all they ask of you.
Economic situation will follow. 

Learn to cultivate a positive mindset.
Get a hobby, pastime and spend time on them regularly. And now, you owe it to redditors here too to take care of yourself

Its never too late. Dear OP, the company you mentioned do provide some sort of help for people with depression and such thoughts. Even though that company is not the best, this is a really good initiative. Do reach out of those people in your office, talk to them. Help is within your reach sir. And having worked in same company, i have seen people with far less communication and writing skills than you being in top positions. Dont lose heart Mate you need counseling and help with mental illness. Please stop, suicide is not a solution, and I know life feels hopeless.

Do you have anyone to talk to? If not then pm me and we can talk.

The first step here is to seek professional counselling. Dm man if you need help. You have some work experience. You were just in a shitty situation. Any choice will be better than suicide. So it's better to talk The biggest privilege is we are alive and have access to unlimited information. Taking breaks is very important life. We think our life bound to our employment and we judge ourselves invariably. The truth is we are all not good at everything that we do,  its supposed to be that way but we are certainly good at something. We need to find what we like. Live our life for ourselves first and nobody else. That is when we will discover what we mean we are much more than the cubicle that we slouch in. Life is much more than a soulless job. Been depressed for about 3 years, On meds and improving. I don't have any elaborate words to teach you about life,but just wanted to say one thing. What your mind is suggesting currently is just a way to get out of all the mess, there are thousand others and maybe better ways. Hang on, it will pass. Hey at least your vocabulary is good. You'll be good at litrature try writing sometime. Nihilist Indian here as well. My mind boggles at the fact that a sizeable population of our country continues to dredge on with their meaningless life.

I have seen the people in IT, they're not useful for anything apart from projecting a really bad image of Indian IT. Many of them don't have the aptitude for it, so it's not their fault, I just feel something like the army, or B. Com. followed by the thousands of niche careers (I know a person who's into SCM, and pretty good at it, I can also imagine how shit she would be at something like coding). People mindlessly going into, medical, engineering, MBA and the institutes encouraging them to screw up their entire life for profit.

Alcohol and weed numb the pain only temporarily, my mind then again starts asking if the purpose of my life is to build something for a firangi, who can then sell it to another firangi, to get this coupons that I can exchange for a lifestyle that tries to emulate the firangis, but a low quality version of it?

I then try to convince myself that there's some redemption in living for my family, but in the end the only thing I'm achieving is the continuation of this mindless drudgery. Hey bro...dont do this...please reply...there is 288k people reading your story and worried about you...we can talk and make ur life better... believe me we can..just reply Sounds a lot like me except I have only a handful of months of work experience but that particular part doesn't bother me as I have zero interests or goals let alone the desire to build a career.

I hope you stumble upon something joyful to live for before it's too late. Am. In a government job.... Less pay and long working hours.... But i have developed hobbies and all... I read a lot and play basketball everyday... So make new passions if this one doesn't serve you well... Easy to say and all but don't give up.... This will all. One day be a learning for you... Dont give up at all.... This is the best advice I was ever given, so I will pass it on to you:

Which college to attend, whether to buy a car, should you get married or not...for any big decision in life, you should wait at least three days.

What you seem to be considering is an irreversible decision. There is no going back. Since this is a very big decision in your life, which will also affect all the friends, family and loved ones in your life, you should take at least three days to consider it.

I am not giving this advice lightly. I have been in your shoes many times, and this is the advice I take. I know you feel extremely low right now, but that feeling is not permanent. After three days, I assure you this feeling will pass. But you cannot be rash. 

I also want to explain to you that there is such as thing as brain chemistry. For people like us, certain neurotransmitters may be low. This is not anyone's fault, it is how we are. I strongly advise you to see a psychologist, and also consider seeing a psychiatrist. When you have a stomach ache, you take medicine to heal your stomach. When there is a chemical imbalance in the brain, taking medicine can drastically improve your life.

I am not a doctor, so please, go see a psychiatrist (these are people who are therapists but also have medical degrees, they are literally brain doctors) and they will help you deal with this.

You are not alone, and if you need to talk to someone feel free to DM me. Dude, I empathize with you since my life has been eerily similar to yours. I just wanted you to know that you write really well and that's something I wished I was good at. Try to use that skill. 

PM me if you would like to talk about anything. Please talk to us. Please. 

We are all here for you and we all care. If you want to vent and you want someone to listen, PM me. I won't offer advice or sympathy, but I'll listen attentively and empathetically. If you don't want that, tell me how you want us to talk and we'll do things your way, at your pace.

I would urge you to seek counselling. It isn't for the weak and the stigma around it is false. As someone who has talked to a lot of people with problems, therapy can and does help.

There is always hope. Promising that things will get better seems disingenuous, because the future is unknown. But, hope remains a constant. And, one more thing remains constant: there are always people who care. You will never trade your place in those people's hearts because your place is permanent and you are irreplaceable to them. Nothing changes that.

Please PM any one of us, myself included. Lay your expectations out and we'll be there for you in the capacity you think you want.

Edit: If anyone reading this feels like you don't have a friend you can call at 2AM, I am ex-London Nightline volunteer and am trained in handling suicide/self-harm calls, along with the heaviest of topics. Don't worry about bogging me down. PM me and I will talk. I will try to ensure that your messages reach me. Alternatively, please go to Nightline.org.uk and use their free IM service. Hey there,

if you want to talk to someone, you can PM. we can talk it over the phone. 

I can guarantee you , you are looking at this the wrong way.

Give me chance to change your mind. 

You got nothing to lose and everything to gain if you just talk to me. Think about parents. Dont leave them alone. Atleast try to live for them. First things first -- SEEK HELP. The kind of thoughts you are describing perfectly fit the clinical definition of depression. I'm sorry that you are going through this, man.

Secondly, look for opportunities that you can do to keep going for now. Since you're on reddit, I suggest looking into /r/slavelabour and other subs. The flow of money will keep you occupied and give you some financial stability and allow you to access more resources.

Lastly, connect with people who are/were in a similar situation and made it out. Hope this helps, good luck to you. Please reach out for some counselling, please think positive, lime many have suggested, you have skills you might not even realize are of great value to many. Like you English composition is way above average and something that you can tap into. Some people might say that you have nothing to loose at this juncture then why not take a risk and do something on the business /freelancing front and see how it goes. Have a positive attitude, don't worry about the world, never think people are out to judge you for what you are in life. Being a ""failure"" (your word) doesn't mean you have to give up, the whole world is out there, go do what makes you happy. You just need a good therapist bro. There are better replies here than mine, so i just hope you find peace man. Bye. OP, you need to stop doing this. Go get some basic checks done. Like thyroid etc. Sit down, make a plan, pop a modafinil every few days and go to work like a madman. You'll be better. Maybe you are not meant for computer jobs..is there anything nelse you are passionate about Try to accept pain.It may not make sense but if you’re able to channel your pain you wouldn’t go through like this.Try to think less and work more.The world is an insanely unfair place and I’m sorry that you had such a difficult life.Just do it for your parents maybe but ending it now will not account for the pain you’ve already faced.People will torture your parents and you’ll be branded useless for the remainder of your remembrance...Just for your parents go through this everyone dies at some point naturally or otherwise.Don’t do it because the moment you’re in the middle of dying you’ll regret it but you’ll not be able to undo it. If you look at the grand scheme of things, the universe doesn't really care about who has achieved how much, and who hasn't. We are all just a speck of dust in the cosmos, a blip in the timeline of the universe. So comparing ourself with other so called ""successful"" people is useless.

On the other hand, there are people in this world who are worse off than you. You at least have a job man... You were once smart, intelligent. 100/100 doesn't just happen.

I have felt the same way in life, and I know it's a shitty feeling. But that is no reason for just giving up. Once you reach rock bottom, the only direction left for you is up.

Think about it this way: Do you really want to be the reason of your parents' sadness? Or do you want to start again, and fight your way through?

Don't go by the norms of the society - So what if society thinks everyone should have a decent job? Fuck that! Make your own way, make your on goals.

Career is just one small part of your life. I don't know why everyone is so fixated on just making money. Find something that truly brings happiness.

Don't be so judgemental on yourself man, you are so young, you can  always start again. Bring back that old you that was cheerful, and smart, and dynamic. I KNOW you can.

DM me, we'll talk more. OP don't do it. You're not a failure, no you're absolutely not! My dear friend. When you read this (I sure home you do) know that you don't owe this fucking world and your parents a thing. You are not trapped even if you think you are. You have what it takes the tell the world to fuck off and make your own rules. Do not get bogged down with people's expectations of what it means to be successful. You are the only one who can define and know what makes you happy. Spend time and money on yourself. Think of what you'd miss. Pets, your favorite foods, tv series, the ability to travel, see beautiful places and faces 

I hope you see this friend. Loads of love to you. Is there any way to know if he's fine? Friends are social investments where time is the currency and a little bit of luck is the seed. You will make some and lose some. I am glad you put your thoughts here and people are helping you out. Stay strong. You need to look at the better side of things, life is not just about a job. You will get other job or can do some other things in life. I will suggest you to take total break for few days. Take 2 weeks off from work and go travel and spend time for yourself. 
Most importantly talk to people you trust and seek professional help. Hey. Seems like we're on the same boat. 

DM me ASAP. 

I talked with several people through Reddit having almost Same issues as you. I don't know I can help you or not but please let me try. I also used to and still alone and unemployed. So I think our aloneness can be togetherness. 

please don't take any unnecessary steps. If you read this, send me a DM. Let's talk. These feelings are not exclusive to you, many people have them. You need help and support, not an ""end"". I hope you get better. Please don’t take any extreme steps dude. Just read the replies here for once. Life is much more than this. Just talk to us; talk to someone and it will all feel better. People do care about you! PM me, I was in a worse situation than you but have sorted my life out. I'm sure I can show you something cool ! OP, listen to this guy. I did not get job for 4 years after engineering in my domain, then changed domain and started from scratch. Never lose hope. OP please don't do it please. It's not as hopeless as it seems to you right now. I've been there. So glad i didn't do it. So much happened and now it seems so stupid that i ever considered it. The world is huge and there are so many possibilities. Please come and talk. I'm here to talk with you, please message me. I am in the exact same situation. Also did my Engineering in Electronics and Instrumentation and my skill set sucks. No friends and nobody who gives a shit about me and I believe I'd take the same route as you in the next 4-6 years. I am saving this so I could use this in the future. First of all, you should immediately seek counselling.

Secondly, your language skills (not your strength in English, but the way you form statements and put it down) gives me an impression that you're not as dumb as you've described yourself. In fact, it shows a very well developed mind who knows how to use words and write. I just checked your post history, it shows a couple of posts in /r/WritingPrompts and also in /r/SuicideWatch. I don't know what to make of all of this. If you're not making this up, I repeat you have to seek counselling immediately. I am trying to report this post anyway. Dude, atleast you should've talked to us once before making up your mind.

I hope you're still there.

Reply to us. We will help you. Talk to your parents man. Just give them a call and  tell them about how you feel. They will surely help you out. Please don't end your life. Its ok to feel these thoughts my friend, Take care of yourself and I hope you don’t do what you intending of doing. This might be the point in your life where things finally turn around. Don't give up!!! OP you could easily pivot your career path in software testing be it Performance testing, API testing ,Selenium Automation testing etc Please think about your family before taking any decision. You going away makes matters worse for your parents.

If not about yourself, think about the driver of the truck the next time when you have such thoughts while on the street. Imagine the guilt he will live with. 

Please please talk to someone, anyone of us if you feel alone. Just went through OP's comments and posts. I am so sorry you have been facing these issues for a long time now. Hang in there, everything will be alright! Hey man ! I have been through the same and come out of it too. All I can tell is to stop comparing with others and start pushing your limit . It feels like shit for a couple of years straight (It did for me) but then I improved. I got better and realised a pattern to pushing myself. You too can do it. Don't do it. Just give life a chance. Don't have too many expectations from yourself. The purpose of life is not to be successful or happy. The purpose of life is to observe and experience it. If you can do that, be it by singing a song, reading a book or talking to a person, do it. 

Do this : If you can, go outside right now, and give 10 rupees to a beggar. If you can't find one, just try to help anyone you can, with any small act possible. Then think about the decision you were making. I’m sorry but don’t do it, there are lots of startup’s looking for different kind of people and not just engineering. I would ask you to take a vacation for yourself and think about all the good things happened in your lives. Stay strong my man. Pls listen to me, this may be a far reach but have you heard of vigyan samagam, search for it, there are 7 mega science projects and out of those 7, at least 6 or maybe all of them need instrumentation engineers who can start afresh. CGPA doesn't matter, they need actual talent which can be applied in those projects. they need people who are fresh, as in who can appreciate the physics and provide the engg skills needed for those projects. Please visit them, apply for jobs there, you may have a chance. I myself am a b.tech student, so I do know what is the placement scenario. Do not give up my mate...
Especially for your parents ....

Every other kid in India has a story exactly like you...infact you might have had a better life as you got placed into a good company...some are still looking for jobs..

The grass is always greener on the other side..
So value what you have..and maybe change your job and get some perspective before deciding anything...

I remember a similar post here from some time back...not sure if it was you..

Take it easy... Bro please reply I am scared for you. I wish I had the words that will make you feel better right away, but I don't. 

I know things might seem a little blurry right now but it will get better, just don't give up. 

If you think you are out of options, trust me ( and I've learned the hard way) there are infinite possible options that will make you feel better and motivate you to better yourself. 
I also know, that you can't think of those options right now, but I don't blame you. I just want to assure you, things can get better. 



Does anyone know if he's alright
Seriously OP if you are reading this, you need counselling, but  if you can't afford it right now,  don't hesitate to DM me, I am sure I can help you in some way, at least make you feel better. Is it possible to report this incident to some authority so as to check up on him? It’s all self pity and disdain until you see someone in a worse situation pull through and ultimately emerge victorious. If anybody knows op then please let us know why isn't he updating. Or if anyone here had a talk with him then please do let us know. I'm worrying for him. Don't do this. Trust me. 
You've forgotten what you have. 

If you could not achieve more, learn to live in less.

Job is just a small part of life. It can be changed. 

Find another passion.

There is so much more to be seen. 

Don't do it. 

Instead, kill your ego.. Read some philosophy. You will find peace. Trust me, I've been there. There isn't just one way to earn money. So many things you can do. I believe in you man! You can do great. Just focus on the right things! It's not too late! Find something in life that you like. It can be hobby  or an interest.  Job is to fill your stomach and unless you have interest in it, you will feel depressed and you need something to look forward to.. It will get better. Just talk with someone. Call your parents. Go home for sometime.
Maybe being away from family is not for you. [https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoopyrun/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoopyrun/)   


Please stay hopeful brother. We love you just the way you are. In the end everything will be okay if not it is not the end. Did anybody hear back from OP?  I hope he is OK. Dude do meditation and start your medication on OCD or go rehab if it helps. Join other jobs like call centre and start small fuck other people who just talk stay connected to people who provide some important info on jobs and creativity. Bring your hobbies into action it helps mentally and try to make money from it. Start trekking get close to nature and others too its good and fast money.

Life ko happy rakhna sikh lo bhai Friend, you are not defined by your failures or successes. You can turn all this around, you can be happy -- I promise. Don't give up, I beg you. We're all in this together, and you can look to others for support. 

Please don't give up. Are bhai I too feel my education has failed somewhat in logical reasoning. I'm starting small with learning pure maths and related books. I suggest you the same, it might be hard to find time but find whatever time and do it. Also.. take the meds. I am probably in a worse situation (in terms of career) than you. I am 28, with family and social situation similar to you. I have been taking exams for government jobs without success. I do not have any job experience. 
I have been depressed for so long that it feels like a part of me now. I too have suicidal thoughts almost on a daily basis. I can relate to the nihilism and OCD pattern you wrote about. I have no control over my negative thoughts. But, there are times when I feel nothing at all. 
You clearly need psychiatric help to deal with it. You should at least watch mental health related videos and talks on YouTube. 
Please, just stay strong. Here is a Frank Herbert quote that always helps me - ""The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience."" Hope you feel better soon. [deleted] [removed] Ignore the other comments.

You are making a decision that affects you and only you. 



If this means that you won't suffer anymore, then I'm happy for you.




I don't understand why the holier than thou commenters think that life is absolutely worth it.


If you are literally so broken then you don't have to go on. You can end your suffering once and for all.

Science/Technology,India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology,16,7tahs2,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-must-shed-intellectual-colonialism-to-excel-in-science-and-technology/story-wfbhX71Evf9ilqqUKkjAQL.html,6,,s18m," Language is least of the issues with science and technology in India. The entire education system is based on the Sharma ji ka beta ko 90% mila tereko 89.9999 kyun mila ? system. The rat race is for marks and not for imparting basic education irrespective of the language.  LOL, fuckers really like tampering with education. How about saying to no to learning *vaimanika shastra* and *gomutra yagnas* etc?

Science isn't intellectual colonialism.By teaching it in Enlish, you are just ensuring that children are able to hook up on research at a global scale directly rather than be mediated by translators. 

Also, fuck your hindi-speaker employment schemes.

 How about NO.  
We need English and it needs to be promoted further.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology** 

 ______ 
There is a major power imbalance in the world, which comes from the language
that dominates the world of discovery, innovation, and science and technology.
Today, that language is English. The intellectual domination of the West comes
from the building of communities whose power comes from their deep connection
with their native language. The language which they use to think, dream and
shape the world is their own. This results in ideas that can change the world.
If you do not use or have a mastery over your native language in science and
technology, then, mere facility makes you a great follower and never a leader.

While overthrowing political and economic colonialism, we have failed to
overthrow intellectual colonialism. In making English the sole language of
intellectual discourse in science and technology in India, we have lost on
many fronts. First, exceptions aide, as a community even our best institutions
can never lead globally if English is the only language of high-level
intellectual discourse. Our best minds will merely be eloquent paraphrasers of
the ideas of others. Second, we close opportunities in intellectual leadership
to huge sections of our population. In other words, as intellectuals we cannot
be the best in the world. In addition to this, we lock the doors to even the
second- level positions we occupy as elites. One of the many consequences of
this is a poor connection of professional leadership with our society. Thus,
we fail in being great intellectuals, we exclude and do not share a sense of
purpose for society. In turn, our society responds to this elitism by
undervaluing learning and the intellectual enterprise.

There have been many examples of countries which have successfully addressed
the twin-challenges of developing communities of intellectual leaders in
science and technology and are yet deeply rooted in using their native
language for churning ideas. In Germany, science students would have had their
principal language as German and yet be fluent in English. Many of the best
German labs are international and the language of discourse may well be in
English, yet, the advantage that comes from the ability that German scientists
have to think in their native language, in the most advanced scientific
subjects, is not small. Conversely, no country, including India, that has
chosen English as its primary language of scientific discourse, ignoring its
local languages, has become an intellectual powerhouse.

Whenever there is a discussion on this subject, two arguments are made against
university education in one’s native language. The first is that English is
necessary in today’s world, which is valid. The answer is not to diminish
English, but to enhance the use of one’s native language at every level. The
second argument is that the task is impossible to implement. This argument is
both a cop-out and false. It is a cop-out because not taking this up forever
makes us an intellectual vassal-state, while maintaining an elite that is both
dysfunctional and disinterested. The argument is false because the task is
entirely feasible with focus and investment.

What, then, is to be done? Currently, the bulk of our college education in
science and technology is notionally in English whereas the bulk of our high-
school education is in the local language. Science courses in college are thus
accessible largely to the urban population and even when this happens,
education is effectively, neither of quality in English nor communicated as
translations of quality in the classroom. Starting with the Kendriya
Vidyalayas and the Nayodya Vidyalayas as test-arenas, we can ensure the
training of teachers so that students in high-school are simultaneously taught
in both their native language and in English. This already happens informally,
but its needs formalisation. The student should be free to take exams in
either language or indeed use a free-flowing mix. This approach should be
steadily ramped up and used in all our best educational institutions in
college and then scaled to be used more widely. Public and private colleges,
in STEM subjects, for example, can lead and make bi-lingual professional
education, attractive and economically viable. Technology, can of course
assist implementation, but the primary driver is a will to change.

Our international partners envy the facility many Indians have with English.
Without losing this, we must also have the ability to think deeply about
complex and difficult subjects at the level of the best in the world. This can
come only when communities in Rajasthan, Kerala or Odisha can wield, in their
minds, their respective languages in the frontier areas of science the way in
which the French, the Dutch or the Germans do. We should not conflate the use
of English as the vehicle for communication and commerce with the use of
language as the basis for the power of ideas.

I know & respect Dr Vijayaraghavan immensely, but this is just bollocks.

Science/Technology,Calculus created in India 250 years before Newton: study - Technology & Science,145,2p81f0,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/calculus-created-in-india-250-years-before-newton-study-1.632433,146,,sjain75," Awesome! I read about this sometime back, but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study then.

Anyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read The Indian Clerk, a book about Ramanujan and his time in England. People are arguing that the Taylor series was proof of invention of calculus. Bitch pls. Be proud if you want to but get your facts right.

While I understand that the Taylor series is a very important concept in calculus, it isn't necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences, convergence, divergence and limits to get to it. The form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts (as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work).

So no, in the true sense, I wouldn't call this the invention of calculus. But it's an absolutely important step there nonetheless... something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on, so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing.  These are REAL Indian achievements. I have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tom-tomming the Taj as a Shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of.  Really, this is new? I thought Madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now. Newton wasn't even the 1st European to develop the calculus.  A better title would be ""Medieval scientists in Kerala invented Infinite Series centuries before the West"".

This is indeed admirable, but please do remember that calculus isn't just about infinite series, the concept of limits, infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial. Infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculus.

Regardless, this is definitely something to be proud about. It's interesting to see proper research into the Indian history of the maths, sciences and economics; since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history. However, using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous, but to be expected. It is a 2007 article, going by the date.

>""There were many reasons why the contribution of the Kerala school has not been acknowledged,"" he said. ""A prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the Non-European world, a legacy of European colonialism and beyond.""

>However, he concedes there are other factors also in play.

>""There is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of Kerala, Malayalam, in which some of most seminal texts, such as the Yuktibhasa, from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written,"" he admits.

I think Mr Gevarghese George, who sounds like an Indian, has got his primes mixed up. The Brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed, if the Journal of the Asiatic Society is anything to go by. I would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as 'other factors', something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feet.

I think we have done much more than just this - in Advanced Mathematics and Astronomy. And then let it all go to seed ... This is mentioned in Wikipedia. 

>In the 14th century, Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the Taylor series and infinite series approximations. However, they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today

The researcher of this article is George Gheverghese Joseph from Kerala. 

 V INVANTED CALCULUSS [removed] Shocked that I haven't seen a **so prod v invant** comment here so far. 

Anyway, now that Western scientists have put this matter to rest, I am sure our fellow randians are convinced. Otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines. Secular feathers will be ruffled. Kya ukhaad liya calculus invent karke Everytime someone comes out with statements like this (especially if they are right), the natural question that arises is - then what the f*** are we doing with our garbage heap of an education system, rote learning, utter absence of creativity, and spectacles like a daytime drama queen (literally) as the person in charge of education, chokehold of bureaucracy, anaemic support for higher education, and research (0.7% vs. 3% of GDP that all of our competitors have)? It must have been invented we had a very skilled and glorious past. Even scientists today r baffled by indian architecture which was created in past. The ashoka pillar is the iron pillar standing in open since years without any rust, and taj mahal ajanta ellora paintings etcetc. But sad truth is today we are a third world country with poverty population explosion and corruption. Just coz ur father was a rich n successfull businessman doesnt mean u keep on doing nothing and encash on his name hope this is clear Not sure, why we always want to compare our civilization with western one. Seems like we still have the inferiority complex because western one ruled over us. 

We know  India is one of the oldest and great civilization. A lot of was discovered and invented in India. But can we focus on how what we are today. Even if Calculus was created in India, no one can deny that Leibniz, Newton and western civilization reinvented it, documented it, promoted it, applied it and made it part of math curriculum. 

So even if India  created calculus, stop finding reasons for how great we were, and discuss on how can be great today.
 Calculus is INDIAN^Mlecch_Certified where is the anti kulcha people now Doesn't matter, because Issac Newton was Indian too. He was kidnapped from Yamuna vaidhshalaya (university) and brainwashed by white people. His real name was Isayu Nathuram. Look it up on Subramanian Swamy's facebook page if you don't beleive me. So we inveneted calculus either way. so prod of r kulcha Doesn't matter. Issac Newton (Ishant Nutan) was actually of Indian origin. His father had emigrated from India.  That is why his father forced Ishant to learn Sanskrit which was responsible for Ishant creating Calculus. ITT : not history not a lot of math, does not compute at all.",2014-12-14 09:36:33
Science/Technology,"‘The most terrifying moments’: India counts down to risky Moon landing | If touchdown is successful, Chandrayaan-2 will be the first lunar mission to explore the south pole.",1733,czf5wi,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02587-4,217,,I1I8I1I," Fingers crossed! but I am sure it will be successful. Wishing all the very best to ISRO! For people asking why ISRO is doing this:

We need to explore moon to find if we can set up a base. So that it will be like a pitstop for deep space missions. To escape earths gravity we need more fuel. But moon's gravity is very weak so we can carry more fuel and more cargo.

To set up the base we need to find if we have sufficient water and other essential minerals. Also to check if we can extract rocket fuel, so that we don't have to transport from earth. 

For ISRO along with all this, it's the first step in sending Landers and rovers for deep space missions like Mars. Sending rovers and landers to moon is relatively cheap compared to Mars if it fails. So they are doing it step by step.

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for my first silver.

Edit: Why we need to do Deep Space exploration:

Because we have such a big universe with so much energy and resources. We are fighting for limited energy and resources here, but if we could tap into the energy and resources of the whole universe including our own sun by building a Dyson Sphere, we will have unlimited clean energy. Then all the climate change problem, everything can be solved in an instance. We already have technology to convert carbon dioxide air into solid carbon but we are not doing it everywhere because energy requirement is high.

If you go back in history, the last dominant species of Earth Dinosaur died when an astroid hit, because they were not technologically mature. We have the technology to track astroid, but it's too difficult to find all astroids in the dark space. It may not be the astroid that will end the human species it may be something else, so to change our fate we need to explore to find a new home. For that deep space exploration is important. Also we as a species are explorers that is why we have colonised the whole earth, next step is the solar system (May be Mars and Titan-One of the Jupiter's Moon)

If something were to happen to earth it's impossible to save everyone at least with the current technology, but we can definitely save the human race. Here is the thing about space exploration: if you aren't doing it yourself, down the line you will have to pay exorbitantly to someone who did. It's simple as that.

If isro wasn't doing its thing all this while, we would've been paying some other countries to launch our satellites and stuffs, military tech and for million other reasons.

So if you are questioning why it's important to explore moon and other places, it's not for you. Maybe it's for the next generation, or the one after that. Or 10 generations from now.

Do we owe it to them? Hell yeah! Why? Because whatever shits we are enjoying right now wasn't created in our own generation with our resources, and so onus is on us to be not Dicks and handicap future generations. *Mereko aisa dhak dhak sa horela hai* *Bhai lund kara de, 500₹ extra le lena* Thanks for posting an article from Nature instead of garbage news sites. The lander of chandrayann 2 named 'Vikram' will land on lunar surface on 7th of September when its rover 'Pragyan' will roll out from 'Vikram' to carry out experiments on the lunar surface for a period of one lunar day which is equal to 14 earth days.The lander has already left the orbiter and is descending toward the moon's surface. I wish everything will come out well as most of the citizens have set their hopes on this mission and their hopes and expectations will do wonders. Fingers crossed. Since I am seeing a lot of negative comments on why we are doing this,  Wouldn't it be better to use this money on education / other things. 

Dude, this is not much money. And education and other things already have budget allowance. We aren't even using that money optimally, so throwing money to other things is not an answer. 


Also, what do you want from our high iq scholars? Work in banks or become IAS instead of becoming scientist, or migrate to NASA? Which most of them are already doing. You want to stop brain drain and want those NASA scientists to return to India, but don't want create jobs for them. 

Also, our satellite and space data can predict cyclones, weather and other things. Should we shut down isro? 


We spend more on Mayawati statues, cricket stadiums and politicians foreign trips then on isro. So the reality is, ISRO budget is not enough, and we need to increase it to support science. ""terrifying"" ???

Why is this word being misused in many chandrayaan articles. Who is being terrified/terrorised and frightened ?

It gives the impression that the scientists are just blindly doing things without confidence, hoping that it touches down. Or Like a student who has not not studied at all & appearing for exams

A more suitable word could be challenging, suspense etc.. Astronomy noob here. Please elaborate what's the context of exploring South Pole? Moon's South Pole or Earth's South Pole? All the children in the comments who are arguing whether this mission is needed or not, it's adorable. Fingers crossed. If they lose contact,just tell tapsee pannu to switch the control system on and off once. /s

All the best! A major question in the comment section is how will space exploration help common people or why is space exploration necessary. Here's my two cents

Space exploration is the pinnacle of science and technology. It is the region where we push the frontiers of knowledge, wisdom. Why push stuff you ask? Because pushing is what generates something new. It's about creating a necessity which then causes inventions. Our cameras, computers, batteries, jet fuels, propulsion systems etc all of them are direct beneficiaries of space exploration. Satellites are behind internet, TV, GPS, cellular network. Not even one of those is dispensable.

Parker probe (the one sent to sun) necessitated the invention of materials that could withstand huge thermal loads. Mars rover would eventually result in more efficient helicopters. Coming to this particular mission, the landing site is unexplored. ANY finding there is going to result in better understanding of our universe.

Speaking of purely monetary terms, ISRO launches satellites of other nations which brings profits. The reliability to price ratio of ISRO is very high which brings many customers.

Take out all of this. Space exploration provides employment.  The money spent on a rocket is not going to waste, it is going back into economy and coming back to the government too in the name of taxes. 

If you can think of ANY other field that could provide inspiration and employment to millions, better our understanding of universe, push for a better technology, be my guest. You know it's scientifically important af if Nature is covering it. Full power to the mission control team and everyone involved. This has been a wonderful project that has really put is out there as one of the stronger nations when it comes to space exploration. Hope it all works out well and we are able to execute all that has been planned for the mission. Godspeed and Jai Hind! It carries the hopes of more than 1.3 billion people. I hope it's a success [for interested people](https://imdb.com/title/tt1772240/). It involves lunar south pole. On 7th September, India will be the first nation to land a machine and study the south pole on Moon. Moon is the 1st step for the interplanetary human civilization of the near future. 1st Moon, then Mars and the NEO asteroids, then the belt - it will unlock unimaginable wealth for mankind. The cost of space exploration is going down with advanced technology. Hopefully, in the near future we would be able to remove our polluting industries and mining to space to make the earth and the ocean pristine again. Best of luck ISRO. Asking out of curiosity, why doesn't India has a ISS lab / module ? Why is it suddenly ""If touchdown is successful""? Have we lost faith in ISRO already? Let's not be so pessimistic. Hope for the success! Veery very true that Indians are unique and doing awesome things with this unique ness The opening words are  ""countless setbacks and delays"". Not sure if that is entirely true. I really never understood the purpose of such mission.

I mean why they want to  explore moon, for water and minerals ? But why ...isn't earth is enough for discovering that. 

Why we need water on moon, we can't civilise million of people like earth ,and even if we find minerals what can we do with it. Like mining them.  ? Is that easy.. economical. It's extremely difficult and I don't think it's economical too

People want to occupy Mars, i never understood why we need Mars. 

We have on earth sufficient minerals and forests , we just failed to properly exploit it without affecting environment.

Millions of people are dying of hunger and many diseases, education has pathetic standards.

For me it's just a show off thing , so that we can show off to rich nation that we also can do same. But we failed to understand Europe USA Japan China are far more developed than India, it's like hobby for them to explore moon Mars Saturn with extra pile of cash.

We have far more important problems than mere spending money on useless mission, it's okay we do such mission when we get developed fairly well then it makes sense 


Health, environment pollution, disaster management , sustainable energy are to be focused more and we need more research on these issues. 

We are spending millions of dollars on finding water on moon , while millions of people don't get water on earth.

Thanks for downvotes  😇 #sillymilestone Can we navigate this unmanned object to the location of the US Flag and debunk the Moon conspiracy once and for all? Please? So, India is going to explore the South pole of the moon.  I bet they find a bunch of dirt, rock, no trees, no grass, no life.  WOW big science.",2019-09-04 11:03:10

1: I used Samsung pay here for the first time. The POS machine was a traditional MST machine. I told the waiter I'd use my phone to make the payment and he just stood back and watched. I just put my fingerprint in, held my phone next to the machine and it read the card. All I had to do was insert the pin and I was done. Waiter didn't react much, probably because he was tired. 

2: I used it at a gelato shop. Same POS machine. The cashier said that they don't support mobile payments (lol). I asked them to hand the machine to me, held my phone next to it and boop. It worked. He was super impressed and had this big grin after the transaction. 

If you have a Samsung phone that supports Samsung pay. Sign up ASAP!

I'm voting for Modi, but seriously this manifesto basically says ""V vill sol all prablem"", without mentioning anything concrete except in the infrastructure development section on page 40.

Well, it's not too bad compared to Pappu's vision of ""Roads don't help poor people, poverty is anyway a state of mind DURRR HURRRR."" I'd be very angry if BJP won the majority and didn't enforce Uniform Civil Code. They have not used the word Mosque. SO , they are only going to support Hindus.

 I will forever be grateful to BJP if they let Hinduism alone. But who am I kidding?  But 2002!

Modi's haters will keep scaremongering about how he will start an orgy of Muslim blood and destroy India.

And whenever he proves them wrong(which is always) they will desperately go back and rake up 2002 again.

This will be their fate for the remainder of their natural lives. They will still be talking about 2002 in 2052. Fuck the elections. You want to see who wins? See who's the friendliest towards the West. Which almost always means they ignore the people. The US has all of their telemarketers and troubleshooters here, they dump all their plastic garbage not far from Chennai, and we provide Trillions in education money and then we stay back there to fill their coffers. 

Meanwhile ours is rapidly a dumping ground of the dregs of the human gene pool. The intelligent procreate less, or emigrate, therefore they will be evolved out of the gene pool.

Basically we're fucked whoever we vote for. So, get yours, or kill everyone in your way. Chances are, you're killing someone stupid. [deleted]",2014-04-07 13:48:59

[Mural graphic drawn by Karthiknathan S. to represent the Fundamental Right to Privacy ](https://preview.redd.it/2ser7nm2x2d41.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fea5aa1425c06d6d3d5119d9318cf9cc6394e16)

Today marks our 71st Republic day. It's been an [annual tradition of sorts](https://internetfreedom.in/a-republic-day-letter-from-iff/) at IFF to use this occasion to reflect and also indicate what small role we hope to play in support of our constitutional ideals.

## India stands on the edge of a technological precipice

Over a year, IFF's work has strengthened on the basis of the generosity and support of many volunteers, collectives and organizations. In many ways  our advocacy has merely been a top-dressing to a richer foundation prepared with the time and labor of others. Today our mission is stronger both in our ability to do our work and cause impact due to these networks of sharing.

To  cause change over the last year IFF has done substantial institutional  engagement on issues ranging from net neutrality, free expression,  privacy and innovation. These are publicly documented on the website and  I invite you to go through them. As we grow capacity, our work will  become more technology, campaign and public centered. This is not to  say, there have not been attempts over the past year. IFF has become  better at collaborations with other individuals and organizations  primarily in the fields of community building and public talks. We would  like to believe we are contributing to greater partnership in the  domains of design, law and computer sciences which are talking to each  other more regularly than ever before.

We  have tried to swiftly respond when citizen needs have arisen on issues  such as intermediary liability, malware hacks, surveillance drones,  facial recognition and internet shutdowns. This has been followed up  with persistent representations, RTIs and even court challenges. Our  greater realization is that much of this work interacts with Government  institutions. It often requires a fresh set of regulations and by its  very nature the results are tangibly felt in the medium to long term. To  accelerate timelines, one of IFF's missions has to be to complement the  power of movements with building resilient organizational capacity.

Financial  sustainability is vital to make such policy victories a practised reality. We have approached fundraising and our expenses with, civic  legitimacy, discipline and transparency (*transparency is major component of our website re-design that will roll out in May, 2020*).  We have focused on implementing a model of individual giving and  recurring donations that provides five membership tiers and receives  funds only from Indians. These have helped us achieve a marginal level  of predictability in fund flows and a continuous channel of feedback and  co-ownership. All of this is a process of iteration and learning.

We  need to do more to come close to our projected revenue targets that are  accommodated by the generous buffer provided by organizational donors.  Many of them have donated to IFF after learning about our work through  our members who have championed our cause to their management. We are  thankful to each one of them, for helping us do our work independently  and even providing us an opportunity to have conversations with them to  explore how digital rights can help improve user trust in their  products.

Today, donations help fund 3 staffers, an off-counsel. Soon 2 more people will be hired to ""*secure*""   the values of the Indian constitution as put forth in the Preamble.  All IFF volunteers, staff and leadership are guided by a sense of  urgency, recognizing that each day is a call to action to defend your  liberty, equality, fraternity and justice in our digital republic. Dr.  B. R. Ambedkar, put it best, just before the Preamble was put to vote  and adopted, “*I say that this  Preamble embodies what is the desire of every member of the House that  this Constitution should have its root, its authority, its sovereignty,* ***from the people***. ***That it has***.”

We are committed to serving everyday Indians like you.

If you would like to support our mission in 2020, I invite you to[ become a IFF Member](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/) today.

Apar Gupta, Executive Director",InternetFreedomIn," Thank you for starting this effort. I hope everyone contributes. More than anything else I’m happy that people are contributing. It shows that they are some people out there who give a damn about what this government is trying to do with data. Thank you for this. Good luck with the contributions. Can someone add a general tag for the sub I'm tired of hate and protests Appreciate the effort to raise awareness about and improve privacy, among other things, in a country where *WhatsApp from Facebook®* permeates the digital realm.

Another topic I have strong (negative) opinions on is pornography, and since www is the most popular medium for it, I decided to look up IFF's stance on it and found a couple of relevant articles that I'd like to comment on here since there is no ability to do so on the site itself.

* By the way, is the ability to comment on articles being considered for the upcoming revamped website? Perhaps this would fall under ""feedback and co-ownership"" mentioned here.
* Along with the publish dates of articles, it'd be good to see the author's name somewhere as well to be able to compare their views over time in different pieces. It's not exactly clear from the positions listed on the [About page](https://internetfreedom.in/about/) who the editor is.

Following quotes are from [https://internetfreedom.in/porn-is-complex-we-call-for-further-study/](https://internetfreedom.in/porn-is-complex-we-call-for-further-study/):

>While porn is problematic for a multitude of reasons \[...\], the principal regulation in India for it originates from victorian sensibilities. 

&#x200B;

>Why should our lives be governed by British era laws on obscenity? Help us fight victorian sensibilities in 2020.

&#x200B;

>It criminalises healthy adult behaviours and represses desire.

&#x200B;

>More worryingly existing criminal provisions on obscenity are being used for criminalising political dissent.

All are unsubstantiated claims presented as facts.

* How was it concluded that porn regulations in India come from ""British era laws"" or ""Victorian sensibilities"" (I'm assuming the ""v"" was intended to be capitalized)? AFAIK, they were only blocked in the past few years, and if anything, Victorian influence on India and its people would be decreasing over time. Are you saying that porn would've been a-ok in the society of pre-colonial India? The language used here seems rather manipulative to me.
* ""healthy adult behaviours and represses desire"": so, the thousands of years that humans spent without pornography were unhealthy and repressed?
* ""criminal provisions on obscenity being used to criminalize political dissent"": I'd be really interested in seeing an instance where political dissent was *criminalized.* Did it mean to say suppressed? Would still like to see where that happened.

On to [https://internetfreedom.in/why-is-porn-being-blocked-in-india-whattheblock/](https://internetfreedom.in/why-is-porn-being-blocked-in-india-whattheblock/):

>Finally, we recognize the concerning psychological impact of porn production and consumption but we do believe that when viewed privately, it falls within an individual’s right to free speech and privacy. This certainly does not include pornography which has minors present in it, or is created in the absence of consent. To make and view pornography belonging to both these classes is not only a crime, but a deep moral stain that results in long lasting physical and mental harm to the participants who are exploited for its production.

Minor meaning physically under 18? How would you determine that from watching a video? What about cases where an actor is physically an adult but lacks somehow in their mental capacity? Would their consent really count? What about videos where all involved individuals are adult and consenting to the act, but are unaware of being recorded (so, a lack of consent there) but it's not apparent in the video. I've personally come across such cases IRL, and on the web.

>We acknowledge that the ethics of mainstream porn production, particularly the portrayal of women and other minorities, merit study and examination.  
>  
>At present, we maintain that pornography production requires greater diversity and strict enforcement.  
>  
>These are issues beyond the scope of our expertise and we look for leadership from feminist and sex workers’ rights organisations

""other minorities""? ""greater diversity""? Feminist leadership to deal with porn related issues?  It's sort of ironic that both articles complain about British/Colonial/Victorian influence in India *in 2020* (!). Why admit that these subjects are beyond the scope of IFF but then push for porn when it's apparent that there are many issues surrounding it.

>IFF will do what it does best, which is fight for internet freedom and the choice of individual internet users in India. This includes the private consumption of content that is deemed obscene under antiquated, colonial laws which should not find space in modern, progressive India.

The content is ""deemed obscene"" even in modern Western world, let alone India, which is why there are 18+ age confirmations on the porn websites. If it weren't deemed obscene, you wouldn't need the ""private"" in there, so the statement contradicts itself, really.",2020-01-26 15:57:13

Science/Technology,Chandrayaan Moon Landing,501,d0ffgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0ffgv/chandrayaan_moon_landing/,1435,"ISRO's Chandrayaan 2 mission is a significant technological event that has kept space watchers in India and across the world riveted. The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

[Everyday Astronaut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQyV2WGmvOs)",freddledgruntbugly," At the ISRO press conference Did you guys hear the angry journalist barking "" where is the chairman, why is he not facing the press"".... As if he has fled away after a scam. Such a scumbag. Ok so some retards are already out with ""wAstAge of PublIc rEsoUrces iN a CountrY oF PoVerTy"" rhetoric, here's the thing.  
  
Total mission cost was 900 cr, a minuscule portion of total budget  
  
India doesn't actually spend that much money on the space program. BJP spent 27000 cr on their 2019 election campaign.  
 
India's space program actually helps in alleviating poverty, by creating jobs, by helping farmers and fishermen by tracking weather activities, by educating poor people through EDUSat etc. It is so painful to watch the ISRO chairman crying. No matter what is the outcome, I will stand by with ISRO, and I will fight internet battles on their behalf, fuck anyone who thinks ISRO is not competent enough. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.

A quote form INTERSTELLAR [removed] What makes it all the more hard to swallow is that the country has (naively)   come to expect a near perfect track record from ISRO 

Sometimes its easy to forget that what we're experimenting with is quite literally ""Rocket Science "" Getting a nation full of people who say space programs are a waste of money to be glued to their TV sets at 2 am in the morning is an achievement in itself. 

ISRO has just inspired a lot of young minds to take up space science as a field of interest. 

Instead of youth saying I want to work at NASA, we might find them saying I want to work for ISRO.

Wake up Vikram. You have a lot more people to inspire. :) [deleted] That journalist Pallava Bagla was a complete asshole for being so rude at the press conf Well done, ISRO!  The lander didn’t work out, but you’re still in orbit, and collecting data.  That’s a big win in itself.  Your flag will be on the surface soon enough. One kid is literally asking how to become President Personally I’m still hopeful. All the banter, name calling and vitriol aside, Godforbid if communication doesn’t get restored, you guys should really be proud of the monumental and prolonged effort and skill that went into reaching as far as you have reached. This is no small feat for a nation. Every moment of this mission has provided your scientists valuable information. Information that which was not handed to you by another country. These sort of attempts contribute in building a culture of making attempts in previously uncharted territory. We all know success greets those who make attempts. Everybody who tries something for the 1st time will be at a disadvantage, learning from it is where it’s at. Success after such setbacks is sweetest and much more meaningful. Imagine how many Indian kids in school will be inspired. Imagine how many more Indian young adults will be part of the next mission. That is how you teach a nation to dream big. Having ambitions that traverse petty human squabbles is what gives a nation its future. Today *is* a historic day for you all. It’s another chapter added to the story of India. 15-20 years from now many of you will be sharing with your kids the story of today. Be proud guys Did anyone else see the short de-briefing? The journalists absolutely hounded the speaker because the Chairperson didn't show up. Why should they act like this? [2019 so far](https://i.imgur.com/sVOzjat.png) Goosebumps moment when Pragyan's tyre tracks showed the National Emblem. I mean in the animated video explaining Pragyan's mission.

Edit: It's there in ISRO YT channel. Did a kid just ask a question about reservation? Dear scientists, we are proud of you.  🇮🇳 Space is tough. Only the Vikram has failed, the orbiter mission was successful. That too, it has lost contact. It might set back our manned moon mission a bit because this is what ISRO was trying, a soft landing. I'm sure there will be another mission soon. GG. Damn Chief do not cry. You did the best! Hopefully this teaches people that failures are part of life and should be accepted.

What an absolute cunt of a guy he is. People on the pakistani sub are also embarrassed by his lack of ingenuity.

There have been other Pakistani trolls who now see this as an opportunity to confront India. Let's make this clear, it has nothing to do with politics, its just jealousy, and hatred that can be seen embedded in their hearts.

One Pakistani guy replied to a post mocking India's achievement saying:

>***The thing is dusron ki nakamyabi pe khush hone wale log mujhe mentally healthy nahi lagte hain. Chahe koi bhi ho india k ho ya Pak k ya world me kahin k bhi. Jo bat hai so hai***

>Dear folks who are reacting to a senior Pakistan Minister’s tasteless comments on ISRO. Please don’t respond to him. He’s behaving like a troll. Poor man stayed up all night to watch the moon mission. Their India obsession continues. We don’t have to obsess in return

A lot of other people have flooded his post with lip-smacking replies that would have made him reflect on his lack of judgment.

This also goes to us, as an Indian, as a citizen of a mature nation, we must not indulge in blatant mockery of anyone just out of bitter spite and envy. I know for a fact that the intellectual elite in Pakistan would not stoop down to this level, but seeing a Federal Minister for Science & Technology gives me a sense of incertitude. Feel bad for K Sivan. His voice was literally shaking. Bollywood: Chaand sifarish jo karta hamari deta wo tumko btaa...

ISRO: We'll get his personal statement just hang on. Bruh I am legit feeling bad for the scientists. I have a question. Doesn't orbiter have a camera attached to it? Can't it show what actually happened to the lander? 

PS dont know much about it, was just speculating.
But literal chills. So proud!! To the people who are calling it a technology demonstration, it is not exactly a technology demonstration. Chandrayaan 1 was more of technology demonstration even though it had some good payloads. 

Chandrayaan 2 is not a technology demonstration. The orbiter is carrying many payloads and is a full fledged lunar mission in itself on par with either ESA or NASA. 

The lander too has some good payloads and the landing mission is in and itself one of the engineering target.

I've worked on the rover movement. The rover is the closest to a technology demonstration even though it carries a couple of payloads. If landing on moon was this hard for a lander, just imagine landing 3 people on moon and that too in fucking 1969 and bringing them back home safely...

How the fuc... Neil DeGrasse Tyson speaking live on Times Now. Never expected him to see on Indian television If Kerbal Space Program has taught me anything, it is to try again. Learn from your mistakes and keep at it until you succeed. I hope ISRO can make it in anothet mission. Best of luck next time! Don't cut off the feed for fuck Sake...let people see the harsh reality!

May be success or failure but let us see that! We are still proud of out scientists and everyone working on this project! [deleted] Reasons data can be lost

1. The lander malfunctioned ,went in too hard and crashed thus destroying the transmitter
2. The transmitter malfunctioned but the lander did manage to carry on and survive

&#x200B;

most likely its Number 1 , but even if the lander did manage to survive  it can't really function without data transmission ISRO Chief, K Sivan to ANI: We've found the location of #VikramLander on lunar surface and orbiter has clicked a thermal image of Lander. But there is no communication yet. We are trying to have contact. It will be communicated soon. 

https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1170611250054627329 [removed] Windows is now rebooting to apply updates... Neil deGrasse Tyson being an absolute person of positivity. His words are so motivating. I am feeling very bad for him :( [removed] [deleted] Think of what a momentous achievement this is: to have come from a smattering of diverse cultures , pedigrees and kingdoms exploited by colonial masters to maintaining a most diverse and robust union. From being a vessel of the worlds pity to being able to emulate and in some aspects supersede the achievements of Soviets and the Americans with both our arms tied behind our backs. What we as Indians achieved here today is still significant and more than any other nation can lay claim to. The object of science is progress. We successfully launched an efficient and cost effective mission to the moon. It was ambitious and indigenous. That in itself is worth a century of pride. The certainty that we will be able to learn move on and get there next time makes me happy. The nat geo host seems to be good! Putting this mission on Livestream should only go on to show how difficult the work that the ladies and gents over at ISRO do. Immense respect for every single person involved and hope this brings more of the bright folks into the field. GG Listening to Neil Degrasse Tyson at 3 am

I count this as an absolute win Didn't feel this bad even after my math board exam ...And that exam was a fucking tragedy Bhai ₹500 jyaada le le bus land karaa de Some kid actually asked about reservation lol. F That falling short of 2.1 odd kms made me cry! Can truly understand what the ISRO scientists and staff may be going through Non-political, just an ISRO fanboy. Where can I find official ISRO merch? We need to commemorate Chandrayaan 2 forever. Ya it failed. but brighter side is that orbiter is still working absolutely perfectly. The moon is India’s backyard- Neil deGrasse Tyson From twitter @AksharPathak

[Everyone's like ""oh why is Chandrayaan landing so late in the night I won't be up to see it"", what else were you expecting ki day mein land hoga how is that possible din mein moon hota nahi you idiots.](https://twitter.com/AksharPathak/status/1170012859658489856) An expert on DD says the velocity was supposed to be 2m/s when we saw around 40m/s. Doesn't sound good. During the live descent trajectory plot that was displayed on screen it can be seen that the green line represented actual trajectory and the red line represented planned trajectory.

Could someone theorize (or attempt to explain) as to why the green dot representing the lander proceeded (and eventually stopped) until \~0.5 Km but the official announcement mentioned that communications were lost at 2.1km above the surface ?

How exactly was ISRO measuring the vertical altitude of the lander ? Might be little off topic, but i really want watch this on big screen. Portrayal of failures is as important as success. I believe they can be more inspiring considering success is build on layers of failures.
Failures are often stereotyped, i really hope someone comes up with it. Heard one of the scientists say ""kya btaogae ghar pe ?"" (""What will you inform at home ?""). This hurts man. We are proud of our scientists. They have created history. No need to lose heart. Our scientists have done a great job. 

Jai Hind!

- Arvind Kejriwal It's hard to see, after so much anticipation that we couldn't reach the mark. This would be a remarkable takeaway for ISRO and for it's quest in doing something valuable for the country. 

The mission was allocated at a cost of Rs 978 crores (which is around 141 Million dollars). 

The prime minister was there consoling the scientists. Social media has been supportive.  Every citizen has backed them! And we continue to do. The PM mentioned the moment, when the announcement was made about the 'lost in communication', the scientists received a major shock. The Pm consoled them and the emotional Chairman Mr K Sivan which was heart breaking to watch!

*..Mahn that for me shows the amount of dedication our intelligent minds put to explore the world.*

This, as I mentioned will be a major takeaway. ISRO is still trying to access communication, and we hope for the best as always.

Some have said that the whole mission should had undergone in secrecy and others object to it by saying that it takes a lot of courage to show your failures. 

*There were also people who commented on the downfall of the economy stating that India should get it's priorities right.*

We as a nation's intellectual minds proceed relentlessly towards development and major breakthroughs in the STEM field. There will always be ups and downs, like these, and it is the fundamental duty of every citizen to encourage and motivate anyone on the quest for the incredible! 


Mera Bharat Desh Mahaan! JAI HIND!!! 50 rs extra lelo bas land kara do 😒 Looks like it crash landed. There were two other communication systems in place outside of India and all three of them (ISRO+2) lost communication. Most probable cause is hardware malfunction of vikram. I hope I'm wrong though. I hope it just comes back when everyone is about to leave like in hindi movie We go again. Space is hard guys, we go again. Hope those kids don’t lose morale and take it as a challenge and pursue career in astronomy and get us success in future. group hugs y'all I am not certain but I think it was Curiosity or Opportunity Rover where NASA tried and made the rover fit inside a huge ball, think it was? And the ball just absorbed all the entry impact in Mars and then opened up for the rover to explore. Could we have tried something of that sort or am I too Naive? So the landing was guided or non guided? What bewilders me is the fact that people are so dejected with the lost communication as if it is all over. For starters, let me tell you such missions are fully automated so there is a significant possibility that the lander might be sitting duck on the moon. I strongly believe that our scientists would have a contingency plan to relay communication using the orbiter. For that we have to wait till the orbiter is in the right position. Otherwise, if the lander has crash landed on the surface then its debris would be captured by the orbiter. Till then there is hope. Did Vikram die? :( I hope he is alive up there Please don't give front row seat to the Isha Yoga guy or any one who feeds on gullibility, spreads misinformation, showcases utter disregard and disrespect towards science. Not because, I hate those kind of people; but because you're insulting hardworking people of ISRO and other people who have contributed to the mission.

IMO, front row seats should belong only to scientists and journalists who have dedicated their life towards progress of science. Motherfucker mujhse pehli try mein code compile nahi hota and these guys are landing shit on the motherfucking moon. I feel so stupid Did we lose contact or shit? We might  have some bad news, it looks like  lander should have sent confirmation by now. [This was the first moment which made me feel something has gone wrong.](https://i.imgur.com/iESr1nG.jpg) Semi final wali feeling Stop hitting him, he did the best he could, maybe next time better :( Not bad from kaka. Good thing to hear for the scientists. ""I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless. It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same."" :( Orbiter is still fine. Let's hope for the best what exactly happened? is the rover landed but lost communication? or no status known of landing? just want to say, i am proud that we tried it and did it the best possible way. hope isro has better data now to do next landing with more precision. ""jeevan me utar chadhav ate rehte hai. Lekin ye chota achievement nahi hai. Aapne bahut kuch sikhaya hai hame. Himmat ke sath chale. Mai aapke sath hun. Wish you all the best""- PM to ISRO scientists Loud angry question by NDTV reporter Pallava Bagla about why chairman wasn’t here to announce this instead of a “junior” spokesperson. 

Some uncomfortable stares. 

“Data is being analyzed” 

:(

(More awkward than that lander failure) Why is the green line moving away from the red one I hope that is not the case but I think that the spacecraft has crashed. At ~12-13 mins the data stopped updating and the scientists starting getting concerned.

When looking at the numbers, the last update was that the craft had a horizontal descent velocity of ~48m/s at a bit under 400m height, which is nearly 170-200km/h and vertical descent velocity of 59m/s, which is around 240km/h. To put it in perspective, the craft was descending at a speed faster than most if not all trains running in this country. Reading Modi's last tweet, Seems like there is no revival and the Vikram Lander mission has failed...

More power to the scientists though,worked like crazy hard for everything! Last 1.2 km and bam...right in the feels man... Indian Parents will hate Neil uncle for his tips given to the students. I wonder what happened to Vikram after we lost contact, did it drift away from the Moon surface or crash land on it.. [https://twitter.com/fawadchaudhry/status/1170073327324545024?s=20](https://twitter.com/fawadchaudhry/status/1170073327324545024?s=20)

  


He is s&t minister of Pakistan [removed] I have grown up with ISRO. I have seen more failed mission live than successful ones. ISRO really struggled post-1998 sanctions. It was a time when our workhorse PSLV also used to fail but I never saw such negativity back then. Of course, there were not much of social media back then and people were not so invested either. Only Door Darshan TV channel used to broadcast some snippets during launch. Hell, I used to find launch timings buried deep into newspapers. But ISRO always came through. They struggled through cryogenic engines and GSLV too but look how the tamed those naughty beasts. Rocket science is tricky and history teaches us that it can be perfected only by trial & error. Look at DRDO's missile programs, its rather high failure rates is an assurance that we are indeed doing our own R&D and not just C/P imported tech. Today we have a comprehensive missile program which, I can say proudly, is mostly indigenous. And we have ISRO to thank it for. Just this week, IAF placed unfaltering confidence on our own ""Akash Defense System"" over much sophisticated Israeli system, a true joyus occasion. ISRO will come through, have faith.

&#x200B;

The important thing is we must not get demoralized. We have to try again. Next decade is important and we might see a ""moon rush"" again after NASA's Artemis mission. To the infinity and beyond. 🚀 #ISRO [@ChrisG_NSF
If Vikram failed to land - which it looks like - REMEMBER the ORBITER is where 95% of the experiments are. The Orbiter is safely in Lunar orbit and performing its mission. This is not a total failure. Not at all. #Chandrayaan2 #India #MoonLanding #VikramLander](https://twitter.com/ChrisG_NSF/status/1170072433115762688?s=20) Finally some good news for us. I hope ISRO nails the landing. Shit. Modi's leaving. Itna to boards k results k lie tension nhi hui Their body language is saying it all. Feels bad man they have worked so hard. Ight imma head out ""Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment. Full effort is full victory.""

Mahatma Gandhi A bit unfortunate, but it's still something to take pride in. Not many countries can even attempt something like this. Hopefully we will learn from this and will successfully land the next one. It's official now. Lander communications was lost around 2.1 Kms above surface. Data being analysed. The last data was like .335 km altitude and 45 m/s velocity i believe when they lost signal. Thats a quite high velocity. Everyone can bask in success and offer congratulations , Its in times of adversities like these when we get to see who is truly supporting the Space Mission and who all are just bandwagoning for success. [Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity](https://genius.com/Eminem-lose-yourself-lyrics#note-57553), 

back to the lab again Happiest person right now is Akshay Kumar... He, now, doesn't only have a patriotic script but a patriotic emotional thrilling suspense script. The only bad thing about this is DD's broadcast. That shit is old af. Good guy Modi consolled Sivan before finally leaving. The greatest success with this mission was that how many people will now aspire to study STEM I'm a bit out of the loop here. Will we see live video of the landing streamed ? I didn't even know if that's possible but wasn't the moon landing seen live in 1969. Bruh why the fuck is Gaurav Kapoor hosting this on hotstsar 

This is funniest thing I've seen in a long time Not receiving data it seems What is going on right now? Seems like a chilled silence... Did it crash? Fuck this is nerve wrecking I don't wanna go Mr. Stark.... I think we still did good guys. May be we will do lot better next time. The orbiter will still collect the data. So that's good news. The faces say it all.  It's gone splat. </3

I always liked space explorations, I used to have one small step as a ringtone, this was my chance to witness 1969 :( I am so nervous. I have no idea what happened, but at the same time the faces on the screen tell me that I know what happened. Damn, everyone looking sad as fuck. F for respect and GG for the efforts. That kids from Bhutan looked so scared Oh plz this is the starting of memes #Statement Coming! Watching the opportunity time lapse video on the surface of Mars made me jealous, there could have been similar videos of the moon from C2.  So close, yet so far. 😭 [Everyone at ISRO rn](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDzvyKLUcAAxqg6?format=jpg&name=900x900) A kid is asking him about reservations and he fucked right out of there. Lol. Complete switch off karke switch on try kiya kya? Sonakshi Sinha knows it. 


/s Need the bollywood twist, come on Vikram! ISRO CHIEF: If he pats me on the back one more time.... Any of you feeling bad for working for corporate and not some organization like ISRO? omg, the commentator is about to go down on modi We're in the end game now Stuck in DRS?  Cmon, the suspense is killing me! i think they've told the PM that its failed A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to the computer What data Issa okay. Shit happens. Efforts, people. It would've been wierd if the PM had bolted without giving this pep talk Livestreams ended on all platforms.  
I'd say that's the confirmation I saw the last distance from the surface as 330 m. But the contact was lost at 2.1 km from the surface. So, how was it tracked till 330 m?

What am I missing here? Am not gonna lose Is there going to be a livestream on YouTube? What if instead of water Chandrayan 2 finds oil on Moon, and we see a Press Conference by Trump that they will bring democracy to the Moon. Chalo koi nhi. Boys played well Space is hard man...unknown shit, walking in dark, nobody to give hand, once lost, lost.... rare unscripted speech from modi Just try again. It took hundreds of billions for US to land person on moon. India spent only 150 million yet Modi looks visibly annoyed with the kids. Poor scientists look scared...

Fuck this shit man, The pressure of mission success and on top of that the pressure from Seniors and Politician for their PR...Fuck this! Can we absolutely not get political and shift the attention to the scientists? 

Bruh they were made excited for this shit and y'all busy commenting about how Modi needs to STFU. What else can he do at this moment to be really honest. I hate his politics, but respect to him for the speech and answers Guys, the orbiter is still there and will remain there for another year, meanwhile Pragyaan was supposed to be there for 2 weeks. This mission was not a complete failure like some people are making it to be. Hopefully our students will take this in a positive manner and strive to achieve more in science. Our country needs more scientists, doctors and engineers. Akshay Kumar probably crying as he can't make next film... [removed] It crashed because lander ne paao upar nahi kiye they I'm abuzz. It's almost 9 PM here and we're having a ""Moon landing party"" between roommates. Granted most of them are Irish who just want a reason to drink, but we're buzzed nonetheless.

What's better is that my whole extended family seems to be up, I've already talked to uncles and cousins, even got sharma ji ka beta'd from my mom. This is the time to stand with the scientists, not abandon them!!! /r/yesyesyesno? At least it will stay on the moon forever and was the first object to land on the south. Bhai 200-500 jyada lele...buss land kara do Did modi just took an unscripted question ? Modiji: In bachon ko hi ab se interview dunga Getting super scary. It’s was travelling around 200kmph 😰 If it lost contact at 40ms, did it go splat at 40ms into the ground or was the trajectory preprogrammed It's so fucking crazy seeing all this unfold live! Houston, we've a problem. A huge F for our boy Vikram :( ""Telemetry is lost and no RF received"" were some faint voices near the control panel. Looks like a crash. Fuck why does this seem so scripted. did they get the data back? Did anyone see the lander doing a flip right before landing (during fine braking phase) on those illustrations/visuals? Chalo bhaiyoo Friday night kaafi wild Rahi. Ab sojaate h First mudiji fucks off.
Then they cut the live isro feed.
Dafuq is going on? It looks bad guys .. Aaah man... Anybody has an idea that how much time goes into analysis of the said data? Aliens got to it Mera Vikram aayega people said there would be some announcement. Link? So when we will get first update from orbiter? AS ISRO REACHED FOR THE MOON, ITS SCIENTISTS FACE PAY CUTS

As the nation gets hyped with praise pouring in from all corners, ISRO scientists aren't quit happy with the recent decision of the govt to reduce salaries of about Rs10,000/month.

This is the absolute opposite of the 1996 decision that approved for double hikes in salaries. 

The appeal has been penned by the chairman of SEA (Space Engineers Association).

""The government order talks of the performance-related incentive scheme (PRIS), which it says should not affect the 1996 decision of the double increments for ISRO staffers, because PRIS does not affect the basic income of any government servant.""

Akshay kumar has a nice script for movie Can we stop showering attention on every move Modi makes and actually focus on the scientists ffs. Theres plenty of time to bash him,but this isnt one. Im legitimately feeling sad about this:( Here is the first line of the control module's code:

    /*-----Om Shri Ganeshaaya namah-----*/ Yo this looks fooking interesting - probably some kid who watched this these guys are no nonsense , If they knew 100% it has failed they would have announced it by now

There still might be a sliver of a chance Fingers crossed that we can emerge stronger from this and funding is not cut. If i am not wrong Nat Geo is actually airing a show in which the channel will telecast chanderyaan 2 landing on moon's surface and the show will probably be shown around 11pm, perhaps? [BGM for](https://youtu.be/m3zvVGJrTP8) those terrifying 15 minutes ready. SPACE & UNIVERSE ([YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZiJMW5AdHY)) seems to be the one stream showing live feedback, is it from the orbiter? Even official ISRO is not showing that stream.

Update-1 | 1:07 AM: None of the mission control screens, seems to show what SPACE & UNIVERSE is showing. It seems very suspicious, are they just showing some old pre-recorded lunar video?

Update-2 | 1:19 AM: Yep, what they were showing till now was old video from some lunar mission. They have now switched to mission control video like all other streams. Is that Internet Explorer lol? Matlab!!? Im so excited, fingers crossed. From their looks, feels like scientists needs a good sleep...all with the puffed & tired eyes...

Hope all goes well and they get one! Doesnt look good. Not receiving telemetry from Mauritius no signal coming in from mauritius station ...The longer it goes on the worse the chances of success Doesn't look good guys. massive klpd BC, fuck. We all jinxed it. Pls pls Fuck modi is going down # F [So close...](https://i.imgur.com/IVYsgCI.png) Why it feels like this is a drama and soon they will celebrate... they r fuckimg with everyone... Mil gaya data Wait....Did someone mention SSR is receiving data?. Damn they cut the feed. Looks like a attempt only Bois :( why are the tables squiggly rather than straight? Genuine question +19 minutes since the link was lost. Listening to Man on the Moon in memory of our boi Vikram and lil bro Pragyan.. Heartbreaking. :(  I’m so sad Has this mission failed or there is still some hope?

Modi leaving is giving mixed signals. Unrelated,but why are so many of those kids wearing glasses Looks like failure in the late stage of the lander. We are gonna come back for sure but this is gonna hurt for a while... Word from ISRO, in next 12 minutes...Wait! Joe ""Rahul ShivShankar"" Rogan Bhai 500 lele bas land karade Yeh PUBG wala hain kya! F This is like the climax of a movie scene fuckkk plssss Kaka bhaag gaya? While it's sad, at least it was not a manned mission. The only loss is material. Neil deGrasse Tyson on Times now...never thought I'd say that Good job lads Remember that state of unity costed three times more than Chandra yaan 2 Why has everyone in this thread given up? Vikram is automated and loss of signal doesn't mean that it crashed. Go to sleep guys.. There probably won't be any big updates till the morning

They'll corroborate and confirm the landing malfunction in a few more hours I can already see the Akshay Kumar starring biopic. MISSION SUCCESS: 95% (So far)

Orbiter is the main mission. Lander and rover is like tech demonstration and a milestone that we landed on the surface. 

Hope we wake up in the morning with good news. 


Crash Landing is landing too. 100% ^\^s Ground Control to Major Tom  
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong  
Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
Can you....  
  
  
....Here am I floating 'round my tin can  
Far above the moon  
Planet Earth is blue  
And there's nothing I can do.. One small step for Vikram. One giant leap for 1.3 billion. Let's go. Amit bhai kuch karo.. halat tight h It reached till 400 meters...Seems like it lost the projected path there after and hit ground on uneven level... 

Hope, the rover is still okay and does its work! But first communication with lander is must...

Oh you 4 crore Gods, wake up...Wake up! Modi said bye... Mission failed we'll get em next time Can anyone sum up what's happened? Really lost here. RIP YouTube Stream as soon as Modi left PM to address nation at 8am from ISRO control centre Rahul Shivshankar on Times Now World looks out of his depth lol.
Edit : Misspelt his name. Why do they have hindi and english in the same stream, i dont like to hear the same thing 2 times , are there english only streams anywhere? The descent phase begins ....Almost like watching a thriller. Good luck guys... Will we get to see the real live stream from the satellite? History in the making. I like how everyone is in formals but this one dude comes in a jacket Man that people at ISRO are excited as kids. Their so much hard work is finally paying off. Oh, fuck. what's happening ...fuck me Something is definately off rn. Patience, thoda patience Looks bad guys. The orbiter will still be running so at least there's that Did we lost the communication with the probe? F Bhai panga ho gya ITS RECIEVING DTAA!?!?!? Hang in there, mates. the ""RF to orbiter"" is for the orbiter not Vikram Arrey koi confirm karo. RF! Bhai, Terror wala phase khatam hi nhi ho rha Hopefully the orbiter can carry on with its experiments even if Vikram has issues feed re-started !! Live stream announcement just now said only that the vehicle was observed until a certain altitude then communications were lost. 

They have not specified loss of the landing vehicle, but it is implied.  

This is sad. Peetega kya saley Ya looks like a crash... Modi giving pick up speech. Damn... Man i feel so sad.... When is the next moon mission?

November? is this a first major failure? It is taking so long because IBM is doing the RCA. Was landing automatic or manual? Did the lander take commands from here at each step of the way or the process was completely handled by itself with all the commands on it already? ﻿ Yo introvertedguy whatever...

Can you go 5 secs without making some cringy reference... Nobody wants to see it Well, ISRO does have the balls to livestream it though I'm watching India Today Live and they are doing everything they can to not admit that the lander crashed. They keep saying the landing is ""delayed"" and reiterating praise for Modi for not shitting on the scientists, as if that's a high bar. Rocket science is fucking hard, they shouldn't be ashamed to admit that this is a setback. [deleted] I think the PM left. We all know what that means boys. Modi: Ight imma head out! Experts at Home: ""Solar battery phook gayi"" 😂 [removed] Remember to play this as it lands

People who grew up in the 80's will understand scenes if the computer bluescreens Need more practice playing Kerbal Space Program it seems I need a cigarette Data is being analysed!! Modi is leaving. that's it boys. Can we see our scientists, please?
They matter the most, here! Loads and loads of mud sledging will happen...But just remwber your every word and criticism will be directed towards those hardworking Scientists!

If had it been Success it would be shared among all, but when its failure it will be of scientists. That's just how it is.

So just be careful. :( LOL, just watched the PM dodge a question on reservation. [removed] Neil Tyson ne Times Now ki TRP bada di Idk why but i am feeling so sad right now and i can't control it! Hope i will get to hear good news on the morning. ✌ So is it confirmed dead? Well guess no new movie from Akshay Kumar. Yo idiots ...You'll have plenty of opportunities to shit on Modi and the gov later

Some unity and compassion  right now wouldn't go amiss Most of the scientists looks like my neighborhood kulcha uncles and aunties Whatever the agenda maybe, but kudos to kaka for being there and talking to all the people and asking them to be courageous. Fuck, it looks like it crashed Wait Modi leaving? Why?? This is just like Dhoni waiting till the end saying not yet, to hit those 14 runs in last over...

Fingers crossed! All is well... If Vikram has crashed, how will we know it? at least we tried Seems like a crash boys.
Martians got the landing craft. The raeson for feed cut might also be partially that some passionate folks might have started crying.

Modi alos said ""Be courageous"". Yep it's over. That be courageous line confirmed it.


F. Lander landed on the moon, and the communication between lander and orbiter is back...We will need to check the whereabouts of lander from orbiter. 

Lastly, the rover can still be activated and made to do his walk...Let's hope for best! Wrong question at very wrong time girl. Good man Modi...First time since he became PM I am happy by his words for those Scientists...His words will lift their morals! Be courageous. Economy ka kuch dekho ""Be courageous"". Man this is one time when I didn't want to hear any pep talk :( Why did they cut feed?
Gimme my right to information Pondicherry ko wadakkam! [Neil deGrasse Tyson is live on Times now](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/live-tv) >This is Mission Control Centre. #VikramLander descent was as planned and normal performance was observed up to an altitude of 2.1 km. Subsequently, communication from Lander to the ground stations was lost. Data is being analyzed.
#[ISRO](https://twitter.com/isro/status/1170086810006900736?s=09) Regardless of the mission's outcome, can someone shed some light as to why we were focusing on moon instead of mars where there's a possibility of sustaining life? I get that no one has explored the dark side of the moon or whatever it is called but is it more important than Mars? We do have plans for Mars but I suppose if we focused more on that instead of moon then that mission will have a greater chance at success. About time people.. Why is this thread dead It's happening!! Ruh oh Something screwed up or what Signal's not being received God damn !! Has it landed ? Telemetry lost ??? 
Mission control center looking grim No celebrations so far is bad Only Madrid station is replying to the signal. It finished fine braking correct? Is everything alright? It seems something is not alright . God!!! Plssss. Damn my heart is racing, hoping for the best.... Worried. The mood is looking terrible, across the room Looks like its crashed. 😭 Yo Data pack recharged!! They have communication with the orbiter Did she just say, ... confirmed ?? Receiving data...was that a question or statement? They cut the feed!! Oh god! The uncertainity is getting unbearable :( why is the feed showing a still image? I'm so confused, what is going on? If it was a hard land or crash, what's the odds of Pragyan being OK? Data being analysed Hmm.. Stating the obvious. But what can he do. Can the orbiter or a satellite capture image of the landing site? Who is the astronaut on the hotstar stream? Hotstar stream is  slow compared to YouTube What happens to that spacecraft debris there? Cool This is why you don't need to turn this into a fucking promotional program, space is hard. First thing that crept into my mind was wow they must be so confident they are literally live telecasting the event. Still waiting and hoping that it's just some communication error >	Till date, only three countries - Russia, the US and China-have successfully soft-landed on Moon. Windows update ? Well, F's in the chat for all of us who are going to be late tomorrow to school, college, office , sigh Also F for Vikram RIP RIP RIP [deleted] They should hire an astrologer to use his divya drishti to see what happened [deleted] The livestreams ended when PM left. That's sad. Makes one think if it was all about his visit. 

A debriefing from a scientist before ending the stream could have helped. Why is Modi shown so prominently in a lunar landing event? How are the kids not posting stories smh, is this digital India? Now this is cringe. Please Stop. Guys can you updoot this thread to 200 What’s with grown men giving red roses to modiji? Scientist Aunty is announcing something .. lets hope for the best ,  but it doesn’t look good at all! oof ISRO stream cut It is still a proud moment for us guys. We will come back stronger.  :’) The best thing Modi can say is that we are going to try again. Chandrayaan 2 landed, just not the way it was supposed to [deleted] They're clapping a lot. That's good right? it crashed right? Shit! Come on. We need a win here after all that's happening looks like they exhausted their claps early. Who is going to give Modi the bad news? #F The police walked by the cameraman,and the camera cut off to another one. Hmmmmm /s must be a bad feeling  for the kids ... Kaka is back. [Mission failed we'll get em next time](https://youtu.be/Le9sLw2VdUg) I feel like he says the same things everywhere Has it crashed? Or no signal? Modi kaha gya? F ? Not to worry, Modi ji is now on the floor. [deleted] Maybe it landed and was attacked by the Israeli tardigrades? Watching it live on hotstar. It all seems so scripted. I do hope it is and they announce that the mission is a success like it happens in movie after almost failing in something. Modi is not ready for questions lol This hitting is getting annoying, Mr. Modi. Alright, Clap Clap Clap! Almost there! Vertical descent shortly Why is everyone tensed? What's happening?! Suspence guys...Suspence! 

Do no worry! All will be well... Boys played well, better luck next time. It would be great to be provided an update on if/when the orbiter can 'scan' the landing site and provide an assessment - assuming the onboard systems of the lander are knocked offline by the landing maneuvers... Looks like the orbiter is receiving data? Or was that a question? feed cut? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvloHsmi_vg This duffer Modi spoils my mood. He wants to use everything for PR.

This should be only and only about ISRO scientists. Modi came to take credit... Leaves when landing fails.
But honestly respect to Modi for handling the response well, I think that pep talk was much needed for the scientists at ISRO.
May we reach greater heights! Now I am really worried about the manned space mission.  I'm blaming the inauspicious presence of Modi. Chanda mama so gaye suraj chachu jage....seems very relevent now!!! [deleted] ISRO chairman briefing kaka. Kaka must be saying *Amit ko call lagaun kya? kuch jugaad kar dega.* Nehru you son of a bitch you've done it again! Neil Armstrong was so damn lucky man! Agla wala Mars me bhejo, it should walk more than Opportunity rover. It likely failed, they just want to wait for the signal to confirm it. Social media is like its not a module . Kisika bachcha kho gaya ho lmao.

Maybe people should give two shits about issues that they actually can influence. Is Wikipedia down for you guys too? 

Likely not the cause, but it _may_ be us Indians looking up shit

Edit: it's up When modi came... felt like he was bit off.... thinking about something else..... there is shit about somrthing which makes him stressed oit.. Fuck i am getting panic attacks now . God plss .. let something move . I think it crashed, but, I am still very proud of ISRO. They have done amazing work in this mission too. NDTV ka kehna h ki bht tez takraya isliye Singal toot gya!. [deleted] Yes modi lol Yo Sathvik this is awesome. Glad that other countries explore space other than US, Russia and China 2.1 km, the distance between success and failure. Feel sad for the scientists who have worked hard for so many years. Also, Modi is such a bad omen. [deleted] Nehru is responsible for this. I guess all the praying and astrology really does not work

https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-opinion-was-isro-chief-right-in-offering-prayers-ahead-of-chandrayaan-2-launch/334944 WTF. Why does it look like a PR exercise with the PM now. We want to know the status in the control room. C’monn modi wtf that’s his speech !! Wtf
A person so well at giving speeches. Really those two words ???? Modi is so ready to fire off a tweet like :  The cost if this mission is less than the budget of Avengers Endgame [deleted] [deleted] Oh god here goes gobhi with his pseudo philosophical ramblings again Reminder that 'wAStAge oF PuBliC reSourCes in a CounTRy of pOverTy' is the same type of rhetoric used by sanghis to discredit PhD scholars like Kanhaiya, Shehla Rashid etc. Where did Modi go? Now... where it all begins? **Fake News** Ngl she's kinda cute doe

What's her @ I was up all night😩 nvm
Props to ISRO for attempting It got done oof'd There is no official announcement yet but agar it fails then Modi credits kaise lega saare. Now is the the time we put some money into some real research and development, we have to learn from these mistakes and improve ourselves. It’s a bit irritating to hear the mission was 95% success. For almost 30 years ISRO has been putting payloads into orbits, of  various kinds. 

This time what was different and unique was the payload had to descend and be soft-landed with baby hands.  And then the rover part , which was huge ( If the descent worked) . Both the new and unique parts of the mission didn’t succeed. So you could argue that the mission was a 20% success. 

I prefer to say that this shouldn’t be looked at a binary way. They’ve got to be learning from this experience.

What failed? - thrusters  or some other subsystem ?

Or what failed - the mission itself was strategically wrong - you were trying to land in an area where it was impossible to nail a proper landing ... or you wanted to be ‘1st rank/Guinness ‘ - that peculiar Indian need to be first in something ( first people to land in the hardest spot on the lunar surface)  And whatever happened to “walk before you run” - why not try an easy landing on an easy area. ( hindsight tells us even that’s not easy) I hope bhakts doesn't blame it on Nehru.

Edit : LMAO. Bhakts triggered ""Pragyan will not stray too far from the Vikram lander, given that its maximum range only extends over 500 metres.""

Bit of an anti climax or klpd this.. I have a strong feeling that they'd lie to us now \[**Unpopular opinion**\]

I'm very disappointed by the way ISRO, govt. is handling this failure, they should have come forward with actual data. Every amateur astronomer and enthusiast found that the lander was moving at a velocity in which it is not possible to descent safely, just by looking at the parameters on the mission screens, so why lie to your tax-payers which made this mission possible? 

A-least they didn't do a Balakot and lie to the world that the lander had landed and rover functioned as planned.

Failure was expected, it was a hard mission, kudos to the every person involved, but I have lost faith that any public organization in the country would provide factual data as long as this govt. is in power. Perhaps, future govt. will follow the suit as well, considering how well this strategy works to sway the public opinion. [deleted] [removed] PM Modi obviously hasn't left.

He's just praying to god jee 🙏🏻❤️😍

Whatta wonderful man [deleted] Modi and his speeches, sigh What if it crashes like the Indian economy? /s

Edit: Had to add the /s. Even I don’t want it to crash smh [deleted] Well the real question is whether the lander was tested in all scenarios with the right sort of stress tests, of course the intent here isn't to question the abilities of scientists but to understand why and hopefully futuristic missions learn from it . also there was an initial snag and then they deferred and then they again changed it in a short while. As general public we are obviously proud of frugality of isro but accountability can't be overlooked. It just blows my mind the Soviets did it in 1966. More than 50 years before. We are so far behind. Ab toh Modi phas gaya. Sab kuch live stream pe hai, koi surgical strike type exaggerate karke bol bhi nahi sakta. Is this lady telling or asking data received? So confusing. 10 minutes of lost communication and the entire bjp machinery went into panic mode.  
  
Kashmir has been without communication for a month now. [removed] Looking at the bright side, atleast Modi the braggart didnt get to take the credit for this big a mission..if this was successful, you're certain he'd have built his entire election agenda on roaming around the world boasting about his credentials taking credit for this..ironic for someone as anti-science as him Didn't Dr. Sivan perform puja for the success of the mission? What happened? Why did Modi give that speech ? Have we succeeded ??? Please somebody inform. The news is nonsense It performed oof Not a rocket scientist here but, shouldn't ISRO gone for something like parachute landing with protective bouncing covering like NASA did with Mars rover? Wonder what the logic was to land it with powered engines. I believe 2-3km is a doable height for parachute landings. My 2 cents.. [removed] [deleted] Probably lander ran out of battery, maybe just need to be recharge by solar light [deleted] [removed] FFS! I don't want modiji's lecture now 😡 Did they try turning it off then on again?  F F Technology in India is not there yet 932 crores  of tax payers money wasted . Thanks Isro Welp, a huge failure. [deleted] Well, now we can focus on issues in the country hopefully we're running out of ground water. [deleted] What a failure [deleted] Why the hell is it taking such a long time to land this damn thing? 

I mean it was launched some 40 days ago, wasn't it? PM in ""boys played well inshallah"" mode [removed]",2019-09-06 19:32:53

Science/Technology,India needs to invest more in education and health care or else the future of India is doomed.,191,e6ekhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e6ekhy/india_needs_to_invest_more_in_education_and/,53,"Why doesn't the govt invest more in education? 

Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak. 

However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable , How will india progress?

Investing in education(and healthcare) is one of the best ways to raise the human capital(skills and expertise of the population).

Currently, india ranks 115 in human capital index. Having high human capital is crucial to economic development, increasing productivity, making progress in science and technology and innovation.

According to a report from world bank,[source](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00811/WEB/OTHER/9C8ACC61.HTM?OpenDocument). More than half the children in india are malnourished, 30% of newborns are underweight and 60% of women are anemic. Malnutrition costs india atleast about $10 billion or about Rs. 700 billion(Rs 70,000 crore) in terms of lost productivity , illness and deaths, which is about 23 times the cost of statue of unity.

If india doesn't invest more in education and health care, reforming education and health care system, improving the quality and infrastructure of govt schools and hospitals too, then we will hundreds of millions of unskilled and unproductive people in the future, which would be a disaster to development and progress.",thruaway593," The priorities of the people and (so) of the government are wrong. The government wants to invest in Bullet train. Their priorities are Ram Mandir, Ram Setu, Ram Lalla, Cow Mata, Yoga, Havan, Yagna, etc. It is a clueless government elected by clueless people. They won't invest in education and healthcare. In fact the people of India will not elect a party that sets healthcare and education its priority. They will elect a party that promises to bomb Pakistan or throw the Muslims in the sea. You should not have great expectations from 1.3 billion simpletons. I will keep it simple, when people don't have jobs and education, they are easy to manipulate. That is not going to change because its profitable Basically, we need Kejriwal as the PM If the govt. Invests more in healthcare and education, it is leftist, communist, marxist and what not. If we go by the ammount of young population here, good education will change the country (in a goodway ofc) in no time. If you invest in education, where will you find new bhakts? The education  budget used to me more. 

The govt. Has been gradually reducing it since 2014.  

Priorities. We invested 1% of our GDP last year on health care

&#x200B;

Let this sink in. >Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

The priorities of a supply side regime has always ever been in cutting social expenditure on the side of people.

Why so? Now you can look at classical economics, and try to find what the supply side economics really stand for.

An auction market, where people have ""fair idea of wages and price levels and rights""

Now, you have to question where from can the source of such exploitation be? 

In any case the classical position is that demand will balance itself out (which is a pretty bad argument, I will say), and the effect of government spending is crowding out of investment (which is again a problematic position). So, it has to be G = T, if the equilibrium has to be maintained. And in classical supply side economics, the only way to spurs growth, is to shift the Ns and Nd meeting point far eastwards, with maximum N and minimal real wage, given Y = F (K,N). In order to do that, you need to provide tax cuts, to the richest. Government intervention is doom for them and their market system runs of ""no rights for the employees"" because it is a supply side constraint.

Now you will ask me why am I saying all this, because its really not relevant.

The source of exploitation in the auction market situation is highly imperfect knowledge on the part of the employees (am not saying this, Alfred marshall said this). Now, even the best of capitalists knew that the access of the average worker to the ""education, knowledge, and henceforth rights"" would remain constrained and he would basically be entrapped as ""a labour"", albeit skilled one, with low negotiation power in the face of industry.

The idea of vile maxim and goodwill of the entrepreneur thus was put in the graveyard along with adam smith. Only invisible hand remained.

Public access to education being low, always enables a supply side oligopolist/monopolist to enjoy huge control on the labour. Education, as in education and not just being skilled labor is antithetical to capitalist interests. Little wonder victorian era education wanted man to be an educated slave. Not a leader. Little wonder leadership crisis is real, across nations and across industries.

>Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

>It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak.

Beyond it, its also very gendered. Like take the PLFS and NSSO surveys, the degree of fall in WPR of women, was almost 18% from 2005 to 2018. (Above 15 y of age). Now the average ""bhagwa"" apologist reply is that, see, people must be earning better so girls are in homes. Thus, I decided to look deeper into indices, and an article too confirmed that unemployment, in the poorest expenditure decile fell from 30.8 to 16.5%. 

I took rural women and the lowest expenditure decile to clearly show, that how the lack of education directly affects employability. In this case, lets find out how a govt intervention holds a decent case 

For one, the avg woman selling sabzi in the mandis would rather want to save the extra penny rather than send her daughter to the ""private"" school. She simply cannot afford. And the tragedy of the govt schools is that most lack any decent investment and govt spending. The solution is not privatisation. The solution isn't tax cuts. But to increase govt expenditure per GDP to schools.


>However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable

See, firstly let me tell you this unemployable thing is a horrible joke. India has seen a jobless growth for years. Since 1991. The interest of the firms is profit maximization. So they would retrench people for suitable technology and ask for no minimum wages. You have to understand whether there is a definite need of

A. Corporate accountability fixation? Wherein you should be answerable for the tax cuts you bag in the name of skilling and run some namesake skipping programs, mired with fraud?

B. Corporate entity as a social entity. A corporation must yield to the social contract on the basis of which it exists in the society, or it should have no existence.

C. Prevention of corporate centralization. Or rather monopoly or oligopoly. In which case they fix the norms. 

D. Corporatization of education. Here you have to ask a lot of things, beyond the top 3

One, the affordability of the higher education system. In case one takes away grants, we will literally see the IITs being super expensive wherein the average bloke won't be able to afford it. 

Two, keeping the education sector as free space,as spaces where criticism is allowed. Nowadays, the idea is that you can freely bash the non majoritarian idea (political, economic anything) but whatever comes in direct contradiction to the interests of the cronies is censored out. It might be your book on baba ramdev, or some documentary by chomsky or anything.

Three, killing the art of questioning. This is definitely missing in our syllabus in india, as the most important virtue that's expected of you, is to obey. Now, corporate centralization will be a massive danger, as AV classes with animations become the norm and teachers become obsolete. The students will be required to learn what comes with the package that some company is making. That might be dangerous. Because that doesn't tell the full story. 

Fourth and most definitely this, is the rampage for marks. That's also very equal to what we do in economics, regurgitate growth, as if it is the panacea. No it isn't. The time has come to move on towards better testing procedures that test your ability to analyse what you have studied. Open book tests. Adaptive tests. 

Fifth, and lastly, the threat to critical analysis from corporatocracy. That's exactly what you see when you see when people say 30 year phd in JNU and news channels run it. Par Mandir kahan banayeinge? But first political parties have to save Hindus from Muslims and vice-versa! Eat

Science/Technology,A place to discuss scientific and engineering research for and by Indians? [Science & Technology],9,5jscfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5jscfe/a_place_to_discuss_scientific_and_engineering/,3,"I've been thinking about this for a while. It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

I would like to hear suggestions from randian researchers and non-sci/tech folk alike on this. ",Glorious_Comrade, make linkedin or google groups? you always want to link all these with Twitter/fb pages to harmonize and point to the real source Let everything happen in r/india ,2016-12-23 03:04:49

Science/Technology,Is the Dream of Kalam dead?,83,ei5wg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ei5wg9/is_the_dream_of_kalam_dead/,17,"2020 is finally on the doorstep. For most Indians who grew up in the last two decades, this was a year we were awaiting for, with hopes. Well, it was even more popular than scary-end-of-the-world predictions of 2012 among others! Well, for once hope won over fear!

Now that 2020 is on us, are we the India 2020 that was popularised by Dr. Abdul Kalam? 

That dream is officially 24 years old. Kalam and his team at TIFAC prepared a vision document for the country in 1996, a decade after TIFAC itself was born, incubated under the Dept. of Science & Technology. Kalam took as much pride in the document as in his successes with ISRO and DRDO.
TIFAC laid down a roadmap for sixteen sectors the country should focus on, with numerous sub-areas of technology assessed as the means to acheive it. TIFAC certainly inspired many govt. funded programmes and missions, including TIFAC-CORE which gave a major push for research infrastructure and Industry-academia interaction.

But will 2020 be the year that Kalam and others dreamt of? Most probably not, we are most likely just halfway in that journey. But on the optimistic side, haven't we grown in all terms in the last 24 years?

But it doesn't stop here, and we needn't dwell in regret. In 2015, TIFAC came up with a renewed mission Technology Vision 2035, a sort of version 2.0, in tune with the changes within India and around the world- a fresh technological roadmap for the country's progress. It's a document prepared with so much love, and all lovers of sci-tech should look into it. As the document says: 
""... while TV 2020 spoke to an aspiration of a developed India in 2020, TV 2035 speaks to the realisation of a developed India in 2035""

https://tifac.org.in/index.php/activities/technology-vision-2035

So lovers of science and the country, let's keep dreaming- this time more vividly and work more vigorously to give our tiny bit to it! :)

Happy new year ! let the dreams keep going!",SOCH-staymoderate," Next vision after 2035 will be for 2043 But if we concentrate on technology, innovation, progress and economy, then who will drag us backward with religion and hatred? Shangi already gave us another vision trillion dollar economy. India eej da besht beta! Am I the only one who completely forgot that India was to be superpower in 2020 and just got reminded today cos of the memes?",2020-01-01 01:29:14

The work here is repetitive, with an outdated technology stack and that's why I have been planning to leave it. But I am confused whether to switch the job or do post graduation?

Some background - I graduated from a private college with a BTech degree with average marks. I had some interest in coding since school days that's why I opted for Computer Science. But in the past few months I have come to realize the work I am doing right now is menial and I don't have the skills required to get a job in a good tech company. I have been trying to study to improve them. But without any set target or deadline, I have just wasted the time procrastinating. Also a couple of failed job interviews has made me to think to stop planning about switching and do something else. Like post graduation. GATE and CAT are the only options I have been thinking about because I don't want to study abroad. I have been more inclined towards CAT because syllabus of GATE is vast and since I feel I am good in Logical and Verbal problem solving, given a 8-9 month preparation period I might crack the CAT exam with good percentile. But then I am not sure whether I should leave the tech side for good and switch to management instead.

Please give me some advise about what I should do now. Also please share if anything else comes to your mind that can work for me.",shadow-sphynx," IIITH applications for PGEEE are currently open if you are looking for an Mtech. Exam will be on 26th April. Hey!  You are exactly at the point where I was ten years back. Don't go after the CAT or MBA because it sounds fancy or easy.  You might end up being where you don't want to be.  If you are certain to an extent about what your interests are, it was always better to put more efforts and pursue it, rather than starting something from scratch.  DM me if you feel like you need to talk to someone regarding this. If you have basic CS skills, why not try upskilling into a high demand area like Data science.

I have question about document verification.,6,ex4nis,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ex4nis/anyone_from_infosys_or_any_mncs_i_have_question/,6,"Hey there , greetings of the day. I recently got placed in two MNC's first is 'hexaware technologies' and second is 'infosys'.
I have gap in my education does it matter when they perform background verification and terminate me afterwards?
 
My story is :- passed ssc in 2012 and 11th in 2013 , HSC in 2014 
But i got only 60% marks so i wasn't getting any engineering colleges so i decided to go for direct second year diploma for year 2015 and i failed in it. So i had to make exit from diploma and tried for HSC improvement for year 2016 . Got 62 and choose ""Computer science"" Btech . I'm expecting to get graduated by 2020. Now i have 2 jobs in my hand . Both are MNCs. There was no gap criteria mentioned for hexaware but i am not sure about infosys. But if it had been i wouldn't have had been selected. ( I mentioned 1 year of gap while giving first round of infosys, i got that round cleared too ) 

 Backround check usually happens with third party companies.   And as my portfolio looks life this
2012 SSC
2016 HSC 
2020 Btech 
We can see there is timeframe of 4 years between my 10th and 12th, but that is not even gap as first i gave HSC in 2014 , for 2015 i was pursuing diploma ( which i left )  and 2016 again got through HSC .

Does that show any discrepancy in my educational journey? 
Or background verification team just checks for your graduation marks ? Or will they ask me for more information before terminating me? If that happens :(
Please tell me 
Thanks in advance",kallu2u," Just be honest and give the exact dates and what you were doing in those dates — a timeline, in other words. Given that you have graduated I can’t see them getting too worked up about your schooling.

If they ask mention that you re-sat your HSC to be able to get into engineering and were pursuing a diploma in the interim. But this should be clear from the timeline itself. As long as you declare the gaps properly as per your records you have nothing to worry.",2020-02-01 19:08:46

Science/Technology,1st year ECE graduate who again wants to give Jee Mains. I'm confused and in need of help.,11,exhpcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/exhpcb/1st_year_ece_graduate_who_again_wants_to_give_jee/,2,"Please, I literally don't have anyone to talk with about this thing which is eating my head. 

I passed 12th in 2018, and gave jee for the 1st time. Faired miserably and repeated a year and again gave it in 2019. Again didn't study properly and faired badly. Got into an okay okay private college called Heritage Institute of Technology in Kolkata. I'm studying ECE(Electronics and communication engineering) out there.

I've always wanted to study Computer science. With that in mind, I started trying to study discrete math from online resources. However, after finding the road too steep, I gave up. I thought, it'll be better to get a CS degree.

With that in mind, I decided to write Jee again.

In a private college, cracking GATE is my best option to go to a better place, but I doubt if I'll be capable enough to crack it and get into a better college. So I thought, better to write Jee again and try and get some private college with better placement opportunity so that I won't always be in uncertainty over my future.

But now, I don't know if this is the best decision. I don't know what to do. Whether to give up with Jee or continue. I sometimes feel embarrassed to give the exam again. I hate myself, my choices. I don't really know what I want from life. It's like I'm just doing things, not going anywhere - life has no direction. 
It's a rant, I've no one to discuss this situation with.",introvert_southpaw," Please dont lose heart. Research good colleges in US where you can do Masters in CS like government colleges which will give you funding. Concentrate on your studies and get good grades. r/Indian_academia

I'd keep about 30% for the sciences and for technology. Why this number? Because if I had a 100 Rs. to invest, I'd think it prudent to invest about 30 Rs. in future technologies.

Of this amount, ~30% would go to space exploration and other space programs. Because final frontier and what not. ~60% would go into technologies and applied sciences. And ~10% to the pure and basic sciences, because if there aren't those, then future technologies would stagnate. 6% of total budget is enough ## Union budget of India - 2013

Science/Technology,IITs and IISc elearning Courses in Engineering and Science. The technology is a little dated but the content is generally good.,23,17yxb3,http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/,6,,sig-seg-me," Oh yes, I've used these quite a few times. Some of them are excellent and there was a time when I had to learn some subjects by myself for my research and it either wasn't offered in my university or I had to pay out a ton of cash for that course. NPTEL turned out to be very useful then. They have a lot a advanced as well as fundamental courses on so many engineering topics, it's great even if you're just looking to refresh your concepts. 

That said, I have to mention that not all the professors are good teachers. Some of them put you to sleep instantly with their boring voice and others are not very fluent in English and at times I felt like pulling my hair out. I know that's true for all teachers in general but I think there should be some quality control when you're uploading stuff onto the web for everyone all over the world to see. I tried some courses from coursera the other day and the presentation and stuff in general was a whole lot better, even though there isn't a lack of people with a boring voice. But all in all, NPTEL gets an A+. Sound quality has a lot of room for improvement. I became half deaf once I was watching a video on Linked Lists and it's sound would only come out of 1 side of the headphone. I was at IIT B, and I must confess that I passed most of my exams studying from NPTEL. Most the professors at IIT, wouldn't give you notes or presentations they use in lectures  etc. So either you take stuff down from projector at the speed of the light or use NPTEL. I used the surveying lectures they were really helpful. The Linear Algebra course is pretty good. It has more content than Strang. Awesome!

\> The IISc team observed that at a critical temperature of 160 K (-113.15 degree C) and critical current of little less than 10 milliampere the voltage suddenly shoots up and the gold-silver nanostructures no longer exhibit superconductivity as resistance increases rapidly. A superconductor is one which conducts electricity with zero resistance to the flow of electrons.

\> Clarifying about the zero voltage Prof. Ghosh said, “At temperatures slightly below 161.3 K the voltage is zero up to 10 milliampere current. The voltage may increase at higher current, which was not tested. Similar behaviour was observed in metal whiskers where superconductivity is observed at a lower temperature.

It's not like a very good career choice

I'm a fresher and got placed from my college and working for around 2 months now, but wtf is people's obsession is with this field? It's not a field where you are earning a lot, or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful, even after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa, but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, you're still blind by office timing, it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

Also, one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate, 9 hours in front of computer, and 3 hours in traffic for 5 days a week and wait for weekends to complete your sleep.
Also, if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, your career takes a hit 
I just don't get it, the obsession behind the Computer Science field, why parents put this on their children? And how can they be proud of this? Like what are you proud of, that your child is sitting in front of computer for 9 hours, and work like a slave?",ThrowaWayIdkIffy," It might not be what interests you but all things included, it is a better job than nearly everything else out there right after graduation. In most jobs (engineering or otherwise), you have to sit in front of the computer for 9 hours and you cannot take a vacation when you want and you don't even come close to earning what a software engineer earns. It is also the one field where you can get jobs right out of college. You can say about doctors but not everyone has the memorization capacity, dedication and the amount of time and money required to be one.

The only other alternatives are having a business or working as a freelancer on a contract basis. In the first, you are your own boss and can take vacations but end up worrying about the business 24/7. Also, you need substantial capital to start one and most startups fail. The second option of freelancer is a very unstable one.

Indian parents are most concerned about job stability and finding a suitable wedding match, in both of which Software engineering takes a prime spot (unless you have an MBA of course) Hey one doubt... I became project manager but did not get the 50-60lpa.. kahan complaint karoon? I hear what you are saying. I work around technology, and the completely temporary nature of the skills, and how often you have to start all over and learn all-new skills and technology makes me really stressed. 

I want my kids to understand a bit about tech, but I don’t know that I want them to do it as a career. Assuming OP is right (and he's fucking not) Professions where earning more than 50-60 lpa is possible after 8-10 years are:

1. CA
2. Politician (not sure legally though)
3. Own business
4. Actor (at least TV show lead)
5. Doctor
6. Cricket

There maybe more, but let's look at these first. Now compare the contacts, influence, money, luck and most importantly, time required to do moderately well in any of these fields, as compared to engineering.

Hence confirmed, OP trying to be edgy. >It's not a field where you are earning a lot, 

Wrong. maybe you're not earning enough. Your compensation depends on your negotiation skills and your technical skills.

>you are not your own boss 

In which job you are your boss when you're fresher?

>your not job is respectful, 

Wrong. Maybe your job is not respectful, don't project your own on others

> after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa

I don't know if people earn this much if they become PM

> you may earn 50-60 lpa but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, 

Wrong, you've poor money management and investment skills.

> you're still blind by office timing

Wrong. You work for shitty company.

> it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

Wrong. You work for shitty company.

> Also, one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate.

Wrong. That's for every job if you don't know how to take care of yourself.

>9 hours in front of computer

Wrong. 

>3 hours in traffic. 

Wrong. Not every city is bangalore. even in bangalore not everyone spends 3 hours in traffic.
> wait for weekends to complete your sleep.

Wrong, poor time management skill on your part.


> Also, if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, 

Wrong, fundamentals always remain the same.

>your career takes a hit I just don't get it

Yes, If you weren't good at fundamentals.


> the obsession behind the Computer Science field, why parents put this on their children?

Maybe your parents did, not everyone's parents are same as yours


> And how can they be proud of this?

Ask your parents.

>that your child is sitting in front of computer for 9 hours, and work like a slave?

don't sit in front of your computer for 9 hours then. And don't work like a slave. **have some self respect** So, what is a good career choice? I am an engineer too got my degree from one of the best engineering college in India...I have been working hard for last 5 years now I can buy Jio net pack without asking money from Family. This is how success looks like.. Fuck that. I wish I'd made an effort in school and landed up an engineer. The 'least-resistant' path to success. If you wanna hit certain milestones in life (financial), engineering is the quickest. Engineering has provided a better platform for us middle class folks to have a secure & settled life. Which is an aspiration for most of the middle class. Because we have no scope for apprenticeship education like plumbers/electricians. These professions are looked down upon. We Indians despise those who work with their hands ( blue collar jobs). As a result only two professional lines are open. Since engineering is a cheaper degree (  4 years =5 lacs as opposed to MBBS, 1 year = 15 lacs) most students opt for it. Lol. It's an excellent career option. But then, you need to be competent and competitive. One of the things in India is that there is a natural progression for your education. 

School --> Plus2 --> Engg./MBBS/Degree --> Masters (*if applicable*)

The number of students who try to think out of this, and the number of parents who allow their wards to think out of this is pretty few. There is also the factor of not many students getting a good mentor to get a different direction or at least get enough knowledge about the other options.

In terms of the work, as someone said below, almost every profession nowadays demands that you spend time in front of a computer. This is not applicable only if you are in the sales field, or a factory worker/supervisor or really unskilled labor. Anywhere, where you are in an educated position or even at the managerial level in a factory, you will necessarily end up spending a lot of time in front of the computer doing a lot of documentation and reporting work at least.

I think the essence is to get a job which interests and excites the mind, and in addition, try to get a good remuneration for the same, which can support yourself, your family and whoever is required along with. The demonization of Engineering and Stem studies is incredible. Engineering is hard and good jobs in India are scarce. The main problem is, not everyone can be a good Engineer. Then when people are not capable of doing good Engineering, they despise it.

Does not mean Engineering jobs are bad. Perhaps you are in a bad company or in a bad job in a good company or both. If don't have have attitude or interest or both for engineering, quit right way and do a MBA. Mba jobs require more soft skills than hard skills, so you can bull shit away even if you are not interested. The fact that you think of becoming a project manager in 8 years just as you have started your career shows you have no interest in the fun part of Engineering. So I think it is much better you train for project management with a MBA. 

But if you think Engineering is fun or you have the aptitude for it, then sky is the limit. Immigration has been never so easier and there are also great companies in India depending on your interest. If you are looking for just money you are better of selling soaps and chocolates in a FCMG.

The typical IT companies even after their worst working conditions offer much better than other industries and a good possibility to immigrate or to find a great Indian company to help find a satisfying job. 

Please stop demotivating others with such rants Problem with 2 months of work ex : People with 8-10 years of work ex make 50-60 lakhs.

Unless 8 year work ex guys are coming to your office in BMWs/Audis, you’re in for another reality check soon. 50-60 lpm in 10 years...🙄 sure i will like to smoke whatever it is you are smoking 😬 Shitting on IT is the new fad amongst Millennials. Like shitting on Chetan Baghat. 

It is not a very good career choice? Wow. What else is? 

Like u/SerpantSociety told, most aspects of your questions is wrong. IT is hugely responsible for providing parity to the middle classes of semi-urban and rural India, and that is a fact. Earning 50-60 lpa whilst working a 9 hour day job sounds pretty awesome to someone who grew up in middle class mediocrity. I am sorry but our life experiences are pretty different from those with the privilege of being born in circumstances where ""money isn't important"". I need some help guys. I currently have 3 options to choose from which one should I go for? If I am doing Engineering from a Teir-1/2 College ? 

1- Mechanical Engineering 
2- Civil Engineering 
3- Computer Engineering 

I am not passionate about either of those but I will do anyone of them without any problem as I can work hard and get a degree easily. I just want a field which is safe for the future and guarantees a decent job with a decent salary. Which one should I prioritize first and the least? Any Advice is appreciated. This post is ignorance at its finest. Engineering is a key profession for building an economy, from top to bottom. When India was looking to modernize its infrastructure and economy, they need(ed) a lot more engineers to do it. They had 2 options, bring in engineers from outside, or train a bunch locally, which they chose to do. While India has seen improvements across the board in infrastructure and economic growth, they have trained more engineers than they need and now have a bit of a glut of engineers. With how supply and demand works, the average wage of those engineers has fallen.

The US is seeing something similar in health care. As the baby boomer generation dies off, the smaller number of Gen X's aren't filling up the hospitals and assisted living facilities that where built up for the boomers. Now those facilities are starting to close and we have a glut of doctors and nurses, so the wages for both are falling. 50-60lpa = some people earn that much in their entire career while doing much more strenuous physical labour.  
If you're earning that much you can in most places afford to live near your office drastically cutting down your commutation time.  
  
As for your health that depends on the individuals initiative and lifestyle.  
  
Whether you're earning 0 or crores, there's always a risk of you losing everything

  
As you said in 8-10 years you might earn 50-60lpa. If one is talented and ready to keep on learning forever there is no limit. Plus it is slightly easier to get into this field. the indian education system demands an ideal of 

(1) memory oriented teaching, studying, exam taking

(2) not *very* hard to learn, given a decent effort.

(3) no/little *actual skills*

(4) has **some** demand in the market, i.e., there is a greater chance of getting *some* kind of job with the degree than not.

(5) enables a wider variety of careers than most alternatives

(6) (minor) good for visas demanding 4 years undergrad education. (most BA/BSc etc courses are 3 years, which creates a problems for some visas)  which enables

(7) colleges can charge decent (not great) money for such courses, and the investment of setting up a college, acquiring accreditation etc is (a) reasonable (as compared to setting up a medical college say) and (b) has some kind of cash flow positive business model (though recently the glut of such colleges has killed this)

""Engineering"" (as taught in India) ticks all these boxes. And to be fair, given how the rest of the education system fares, engineering is a decent default for your typical unfocused +2  student to choose. It's an easy way to earn a decent salary. Furthermore, being a modestly successful engineer or programmer doesn't take a ton of innate talent. You might have something special if you get into a top-ranked program, but most people going into the profession are ordinary folks with a lot of pressure behind them.

There are other ways to succeed, but I think Indian parents steer their kids away from them because they're not stable, certain or surefire routes to success. The same dynamic exists in other parts of the world. Being a programmer is a better way of ensuring upwards socio-economic movement than being an anthropologist, historian or radio host. If you're from a poor background, you're probably less inclined to take risks when it comes to career choice versus passion. The same holds true if your parents come from a background, or can remember what living poor was like.

Most Indians are only recently middle-class. Even many upper-middle class people do not come from old money and likely had parents who struggled financially while raising them. So in a place as obsessed with status as India, the trend is to go after ""secure"" money in a way that preserves social standing. There is a cultural and socio-economic component mixed together. 

I know a lot of Eastern-European migrants in the United States. For them, money and status are interchangeable. So you see a lot of Russian and Tatar guys who brag about how they have basically no education but earn as much as doctors with trucking businesses and taxi companies. A lot of them are pretty miserable, though, because they only live to make money. 

Indians do the same shit, except don't see all income as equal (e.g., guy who drives a truck in the U.S. and earns 1 crore per year will be looked upon with disdain versus some programmer who makes 1.5 lpm). But Indians have that same we-were-recently-poor outlook that makes them scoff at any pursuit which isn't money-centric as worthless, even if it is fulfilling, based in passion and genuinely contributes to the well-being of the country and community. 

I know many people who studied subjects like history, sociology and and anthropology. They were all very smart people who got into good PhD programs overseas and are now earning more than the average engineer in India ever will. But that path is riskier, because an above-average sociology student still has a below-average chance of getting into a top-ranked program. Furthermore, people who go that route are basically required to get a doctorate if they ever want any shot of earning a sustainable salary. In a country where getting a job right off campus is a challenge, engineering is offering that. I am not saying that ALL engineers get placed. But its easier to get placed as an average engineer than as a  average XYZ stream person.

> It's not a field where you are earning a lot, or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful, even after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa.

Engineers start out at 3lpa for jobs that can be automated. And they grow at a rate of 5-15% every year. For a basic skillset that is the right amount. Most of the jobs in the other fields also start out like this.

First of all, you don't make 50-60lpa in 8 years unless you started out at 25-30lpa, but if THAT is less for you, I wonder which world you're living in and what profession you imagine will pay more than this to a mass of people. Don't tell me startup or business, because they require a lot of fund to start and they're very risky. Very few startups and businesses make good money.

> but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, you're still blind by office timing, it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

This holds good for most of the other fields. And you can do software engineering and get into freelancing which will give you this option. Not the case with many other fields.

> 9 hours in front of computer

That's on you. If you feel its too much, switch. Not all jobs are like this. A lot of jobs give you work from home options and flexible hours. More now than ever with the startup culture kicking in. You're expected to finish certain tasks and nobody is bothering you until the deadline. In newer companies, you're even allowed to pick what tasks you want to do from a ToDo board, set your own deadlines and work. If that's not freedom for you, idk what is.

> if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, your career takes a hit

Literally same for every profession. If you're a CA who doesn't learn how to comply with GST, your career takes a hit. If you're a teacher who doesn't learn how to teach today's syllabus, your career takes a hit. If you're an agriculturist who doesn't employ modern methods, your career takes a hit!

But to be honest, what you read on hackernews and shit where they say technology X is dead and all is to be taken with a pinch of salt. The industry still has requirements for PHP who's funeral is performed every day by people all over the Internet. So, if someone learnt PHP in 2000s and decided not to learn anything else, doesn't mean they're jobless today. And 15-18 years is enough time for you to progress into management. So, this is also not a very valid reason. Simply because even if you are the 40th or 400th best engineer around, you would still get paid. If you are the 40th as a business in your industry, you will end up dead.

It is quite practical and that is why most Indian parents push this on their children. “In India, people decide what to do in life after they complete their engineering”.

-- Unknown Behencho I'm now mad that I never knew about a job that would have gotten me 5 lakhs per month after 10 years. One reason I think is because it's flexible , you can do whatever you want with an engineering degree , but with other degrees your options become limited. Cum-again please To be frank, this does not seem like a bad option in India.  I know this is not a perfect life and maybe not what you wanted, but that""s life.  Not everyone can become a highly successful person in photography, acting, singing etc. At least with an IT Job, you have an option to pursue your passion and a relatively very less risky job, with ample opportunities in India.  It is actually one of the best options out there. It has been good career choice since 90s. Now it is on the decline but career trends take time to change. Got you . Pakoda bijness promotor ! 60lpa in 8-10 years that too in Average service IT companies like TCS, Wipro, Infosys etc is that even possible? When you start at 3.5lpa I doubt you will reach 60 in 10 years in an average Indian IT company. Hmm, too many people got butthurt from this post I guess. > 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa, 

It may be due to lies/dreams like that... kind of like chasing achhe din. As soon as I get home I will make a write up about it.  
Basically every parents think engineering jobs are easy to get and this made the  study it. Later to just realise it's a shity one and the don't have the courage to face kids.  Kids whose time they wasted.  
If you are unlucky to be born in a family who doesn't know what a engineer does and have to do, then you are fucked.   
My parents still things a electric engineering repairs bulbs and fixes wires.  

I passed from a private engineering college and working under a  PWD contractor. My parents wanted me to study and get a government civil engineering job(lol) .  
 I earn just 20k per month.  Might sound low. Let me tell you the perks.    
Work site is just Rs 20 commute from home and I get around 100 per day for travel.  I leave my home at 10 am and get home around 4 pm.  
My work being managing field and bill work.  PWD Office is 5 min walking from home.  
I have zero to no expenditure. I would like to point out that while engineering jobs give good salary as per Indian standards, but on a global level, we have one of the lowest  salary for an engineering job.


The reason for this is that companies come to India in search of cheap employees. In my own experience I have been in projects where I worked with European engineers. We did the same job, but there was a big pay gap.


Now I get that other countries have high living standards and hence the pay gap is justified. But since the qualification and job is the same, it highlights what Indian engineers can earn by entrepreneurship or freelancing!



I have followed what I have written and have been job free for 2 years now.

edit: So I would suggest to seriously consider entrepreneurship after engineering. Mainly because professions are not redirected in india. Take example pf pharmacy, it is only here where you can get prescription drugs( not only narcs but also antibiotics) can be anywhere without any consequences. Also, if you do get to work on your dream, it is absolutely powerful. I love sci-fi and I am living it. Nothing else is as safe Where do project managers earn 50-60 lakhs. If you go by societal norms, you're a failure if you're not -

1. Engineer 
2. Doctor
3. Entrepreneur
4. Government Servant

Did i miss any? Regardless, fuck societal norms. why India so many Engineers even overseas but India infrastructure shit. poor country means more things need to built and implemented. so parents push kids to look at opportunities to build stuff. rich country you can be an english major and still make kick ass money. Why is this post tagged as travel? It's the Indian way. Doctors have such miserable workdays and compulsory deployment but it's still promoted I would want to be ""50-60 lakh not rich"" person over anything else.",2019-08-28 12:34:05

Raised by Mom who worked at a private school.  

I opted for science after the board exams. Realized I won't even pass, had to fight with family members to change it to Commerce and I passed with 57% marks. 

Came to Mumbai to study CA, Estimated around 2.5 lakhs as fees & Expenses.   Couldn't afford that.  I  had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead. 

Learned computer engineering (hardware networking) for one year  and got a job at a MNC, worked in that field for 6 years. I was just 17 when Joining this Job & a Didn't complete my Graduation. 

Around 5th year in my job I realized I had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems. 


I started learning more and more about it, and build a real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money.  But to really make something worthwhile I had to dedicate more time.  

I used to live in Virar and traveling to Andheri (Mumbai) every day for job took 9 hrs + 4 hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didn't want to work anymore.  

So in around 2013 I left my job and decided to move full time into Internet marketing. 
My wife, her parents and my Mom all thought I have gone mad and pretty stupid. And honestly That's pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age. 

For next 12 months I built websites around local businesses in UK , ranked them and sold the leads to two companies. The most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training. The company paid $35 per lead and I made more than $4K per month (around 2L in INR) with it.  

This boosted my confidence and I invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing. 

I used to post my screenshots on Facebook, In 2014 a random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet.   He looked confident and we meet at a Google conference later that Week.  

We discussed what we both has been doing. He had lots of contacts at emerging companies and I had the skills, strategies , and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns.   it was a promising match and we end up forming a company together. 

We built a digital agency, the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue. We quickly built a team of about 40 ninjas and went on to become a very successful company. 

In next 3 years We worked with more than a dozen listed companies, 3 fortune 500 company and made a lot of money for ourselves.  

At materialistic levels, just last year he bought a very expensive car (80 lakhs), travelled to over 30 countries and I bought  a expensive home (3BHK powai - 2.5 cr).  

We are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to. 

At multiple times in my career I had to fight with my own people, go against the wind to make my way.  

Point of all this is, you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public.  There is a lot of people who are stuck at a job they hate but can't do shit about it. Either for family pressure or a dozen different reasons. 

For You, I strongly recommend that in your free time develop a skill - mostly in a area you enjoy doing , and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income. 
Once you are confident enough and have some numbers (revenue) to back it up, take a leap of faith and see where it takes.   


Don't worry about failure - If you fail, getting a job is the easiest thing to do.   

I agree that the being a  entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else.  Just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that. 

Parents ko bus paise chaiye. As long as they see you are making good enough,  they will be fine. Sooner or later.   My father in-law loves to flaunt when I share my photos with a BMW and mom makes dozens of calls telling all relatives whenever she purchase something expensive.  

They just want to see you happy, it's just that their scale of happiness is a bit off.  Trust them to trust you.",alertify," Thanks for sharing - somewhere there is a person that is at a cross road - who will read this and  your lessons maybe the push they need.

Your story is very inspiring, but this piece of advice is quite... indigestible 1 in a million story imo Good story. And really awesome how you never gave up!

Buuut, here's the thing, this is just one story out of millions.

A good Bo Burnham quote about this :

>I would say don't take  advice from people like me who have gotten very lucky. We're very  biased. You know, like Taylor Swift telling you to follow your dreams is  like a lottery winner telling you, 'Liquidize your assets; buy  Powerball tickets - it works!'

Edit : Not saying you got lucky but you get the gist. >For next 12 months I built websites around local businesses in UK , ranked them and sold the leads to two companies.

I did not understand this, Can someone Explain? I was fired from my job last month and currently I am actively looking for a new job. If you could give me a chance to prove my dedication, I promise you that you won't be disappointed. All I am asking for is to just try and test me. I am really eager to learn and grow. All I need is a leap of faith Good for you man. I needed to hear this story more than your willing to share it. Thank you! I know who you guys are :D

You guys rock :) Amazing writeup and congratulations on your success.But how do you convince yourself that you will eventually get that break though? There is a lot of luck assosciated with success such as yours and even a small event not going your way could deter you. It is not our wont to take such massive risks as leaving a stable job. 
You had a talent! Please be warned: ""Follow your dreams"" is not a sane advice for all. 
Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur (and that's ok). This post has made my day. ty for sharing your story. 
I have been trying to do this for a while.  My problem is  I have no useful interests/skills. I'm trying to find one. 

For people who want to hear more about **side hustle** you can listen to this podcast by  *Chris Guillebeau*. I personally found it inspiring.

https://pca.st/sidehustle >I had more interest in building things on the internet **than fixing active directory problems.**

This made me laugh hard.

Mate, you deserve every bit of your success. Hats off to your hard work, perseverance, and success.

Wtf 2.5 lacs as Ca fees? Where?  ***Post saved successfully*** Give job Survivor bias.. Going through the same thing, traveling from virar to andheri, and yes it's really hectic...some time it takes more than 4 hours + 9 working hours.

Hope the condition will get better, trying my best to learn new technologies and also preparing for mtech exam, if you have any advice for people like me who is quite young and frustrated with the current job let me know, and thank you for sharing your story, stories like these give us hope to fight back irrespective of current situation. [deleted] I needed this today. Thank you for sharing 🙏🏾 Thank you for sharing this, and I know exactly what you're taking about. But sometimes, it's a lot harder than you just made it out to be.
I've been really lucky too. I worked for a bit, and realised I hated what i was doing, and after a lot of trial and error, decided to do something of my own.
I too started something with my partner, a video production house, and worked really hard at it. At first, it was just the 2 of us. Doing everything. And we worked our asses off. We did what we think its good work, gave it our all, and put in all the effort we could to give our clients the best deal possible, each and every single time. Even if it meant we made less profit.
We continued and slowly our team began to grow. 6 years later, and after a lot of struggle, we now have a team of 10.
We've done some great work, and brought our clients really good value for money. Even after putting in so much hard work, effort and our hearts and should in to it, sometimes it feels like you don't get appreciated for what you do at all. A month ago we nearly got cheated out of a very large sum of money [for us]. And all because the people we were working with had huge ego issues. We've managed to get out most of the money, but have still lost a pretty big amount.
This kind of stuff is really demoralising. Especially when you work really hard, give it your all, put in everything you've got, and do a good job.
We're trying really hard to carry on and continue doing good work, but it's so hard to stay positive sometimes. Thank you for sharing your success story and letting us know that good things definitely do happen. I'm going to keep at it. And hope for the best. Thanks a lot for this post ! This is very encouraging . This is amazing! Would love to pick your brain some time. This is a real inspiration. Thank you op Thanks for sharing this amazing story of your life ,very inspiring . +1 for making your interest your side hustle to see if it can generate revenue in the first place. Damn!

I wish to post something like this someday. Good one ☝️ What type of websites did you build around local uk businesses?

I am learning it too, but I dont have a chance to test and practise these skills Great post, thank you for sharing a slice of your journey, I love to draw and edit pictures on my phone after drawing it, I also have developed an interest in digital marketing, where do you reckon I start  ? I have been doing a job for the past 4 years which I dont quite like but gotta do something for gandhi, thank you for reading. Yup Thanks but i still can't figure out my future Inspiring and real. Belief and hustle will get people far. You have also bought the internet down to people who do not know how to use them (the example of the heavy transport driving training). The problem with most techies, myself included, is that we stay in the computer space - its fair money, but the real money is integrating with the business world. Not just money, but independence.  
  
Congrats on a well executed life and career! Great post. But how did you contact UK locals? What was the overall approach? Can you explain that in detail? How did you get the exposure? Cool story. It is good to hear success stories ! Thank you so much, man! Just today I was thinking, what I would do after I graduate? Average marks and the fucked up field of mechanical engineering won't take me anywhere, I was thinking. Reading this, gave me confidence that building skills and struggling will take me somewhere surely! What a wonderful story man kudos on your hardwork ...as I was reading this I had a thought that just pissed me off thing just how many would have said ""ahh u made it there by luck u r one lucky guy"" but u know it's not much of luck than being passionate and working hard As a startup, what problems did you face with respect to setting up a company , paying taxes etc.. Was that an easy process ? OP can i follow you on twitter ? DM your twitter id  if you like the idea This is an amazing story.I've always wanted to try new stuff but most of the time my interests were never related to my job which is why I never went ahead.

Can you elaborate on exactly what skills you learnt regarding during the period you wanted to ""building things on the internet"" since it wasn't related to hardware networking.

I also didn't understand what you actually did with ""building websites around local businesses in UK and ranking them""(excuse my ignorance)

I guess success is the mixture of developing a skill (appropriate for the times) and just putting yourself out there to find like minded people who can complement your skills to achieve business success.

Hopefully your success story continues and even though many have failed where you succeeded they can take some inspiration. This question is for everybody

What are the new skills to be learnt as of today(In any field you're aware of) which might have huge impact in future like those related to digital marketing in 2011 and 2012 by OP) Feeling good for you OP!! Hope my life has a turnaround as such one day. Till then slogging and learning it is... [deleted] Don't worry about failure - If you fail, getting a job is the easiest thing to do.

&#x200B;

Trust me this is hard for me Thanks for sharing your story, sir :) Awesome share. Inspired to do more. Deliver more. Really motivating post will try to grab 1% of this. That is so cool! I'm a 22 year old Internet Marketer myself. I got into it during the 12th grade (just before boards) and started by building sites for people and so on but it was mostly on-off. 3 years ago I quit college to do IM fulltime and have made over $300K online since, doing E-commerce mostly. I have a lot of plans for the future and reading your story just inspires me to go harder at it. 

Good luck with your future endeavors man! To all the skeptics saying that no one talks about failure. How wrong, pickup any successful person's biography, it will be an account of their failures and how they persevered regardless. 


The biggest takeaway from OP's advice is use your free time to develop your skills and then use those skills to break the cycle.

Being an entrepreneur is not the only option. You could learn investing and find ways to generate passive income, start by reading some Warren buffet, some Anthony Robbins. You rock boss. That's the right kinda motivation. BC IIT IIM MNC =Happy life ka funda hi chutiya hai. Paisa banao, khush raho Thanks man, I just started working last year, don't know if I have the necessary skills to make it big. Where do I start, what do I learn. Also what exactly do you mean by digital marketing. What kind of stuff can I focus on to make money? Can I get a job saar? I am useless as of now !!! /u/_Floydian",2019-07-18 14:57:01
Science/Technology,Will the conflict between India and Pakistan ever come to an end?,2,eh3s70,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eh3s70/will_the_conflict_between_india_and_pakistan_ever/,9,"Will peace ever prevail between these two countries?

Since 1947, both countries have been fighting with each other over the issues like kashmir and have fought 4 bloody wars with each other wasting billions of dollars fighting with each other while the people in both countries are suffering because of poverty.

It only seems to getting worse whether it be some terrorist attacks from Pakistan or the stupid kashmir move done by the BJP govt. and increasing the unrest in that place.

Religious extremism is destroying both countries. Both countries seem to be obsessed with religion rather than prosperity and progress.

Imagine if both countries actually focused on development and progress rather than thinking of destroying each other.

Combined population of both the countries is about 1.6 Billion(160 crores) which is about one-fifth or 20% of human population. However more than a quarter of this population is illitrate and both of these countries are very backward when it comes to education, science and technology progress.

Imagine if both of these countries focused on investing in education, healthcare, building economic infrastructure, empowerment of women, increasing literacy rates to 100%, improved their education systems, focusing on economic development, building scientific among the population through proper education rather than fighting over Kashmir out of which nothing was gained, it only lead to deaths of thousands of soldiers of both countries and the suffering of people in Kashmir.

It would be so better if this one-fifth population also contributed to progress of humanity and utilized it's potential.

I'd like to see humanity become a Type 1 civilisation and this means contribution from this one-fifth of humanity is also important.",thruaway593," well if the conflict ends then our politicians will run out of topics for campaign. Our conflict always benefits those in power. Whether it's this fascist govt or the corrupt one before this, or whichever will come after. So nope, don't ever see it coming to an end. idealism apart, indo pak conflict will end only if the border question is resolved. Bangladesh, carved out of pak and having similar social and political character is largely friends with India. That pakistan and India haven't been able to replicate it is due to baggage of history.Howsoever we wish, it requires us to face it head on. At people's level, there isn't much animosity. But governments find it hard to ignore history lest they are criticized. 

And as people more sternly start demanding peace and growth in BOTH countries , govts will start abiding by it and move towards resolution . But anyway, the boundary question will have to be resolved. Other things can always be dealt with, as in Indo Bangladesh relations or even Indo Chinese relations the territory in dispute is too large - so no - it's a ""dead-lock"", even if Pak & India becomes ""bhai-bhai"" 
and since at least India will remain an electoral democracy - NO FUCKING WAY even if hell freezes over.",2019-12-29 16:45:29

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

&#x200B;

Here's a compilation of few:  


 1. **India’s Education Budget Cannot Fund Proposed New Education Policy** \[ [https://www.indiaspend.com/indias-education-budget-cannot-fund-proposed-new-education-policy/](https://www.indiaspend.com/indias-education-budget-cannot-fund-proposed-new-education-policy/) \]

> The BJP-led central governmenthas aggressively pursued the policies of commercialisation, centralisation and communalisation of education. It is accelerating the neo-liberal educational policies of the previous UPA government, aimed at deregulating the education sector and increasing the avenues of profit maximisation for the private capital. However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth. The brunt of these attacks is falling upon the students from the socio-economically exploited and oppressed section.

**[BJP Manifesto](https://www.bjp.org/en/manifesto2019)**

**[Congress Manifesto](https://manifesto.inc.in/en/)**

The BJP Manifesto is available in Hindi and English, while the Congress Manifesto is available in Hindi, English, Odia, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Assamese.

I've provided a few highlights from both the manifestos. The manifestos are large and it is not possible to cover all the points. I have covered the points which I believe are easier to judge on implementability.

* Congress manifesto is longer.
* BJP Manifesto doesn't allow to copy text (even though it is a PDF document).

Let's discuss these manifestos!

",rahulthewall," It is ironical that these manifestos are so optimistic and ideal and yet each Government since as far as I remember fails miserably. No doubt, improvements were made but the pacing is so slow compared to the humongous problems - both social and economical- that I feel hopeless whether I look at these parties. At this stage, I am just wishing that these Sanghis just go away. I don't want another social evil devouring this country. This brazen propaganda and shameful communalization must stop at all cost.  we have to wait years when well-being of our countryman is the first and last topic in any political debate. Congress:

>Congress promises to pass the Constitution (Amendment) Bill to provide for reservation of 33 per cent of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies in the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha. 

BJP:

>Reservation for Women - BJP is committed to 33% reservation in parliament and state assemblies through a constitutional amendment.


They seem unanimous, yet the bill won't pass. Or will it? I'm a first time voter and honestly this is a lot to take in. I can't decide whom to vote for. So, how do I go about doing a SWOT analysis, so to speak, that might help me take an informed and unbiased decision as to who deserves my vote? I really don't want to hit the NOTA , I'd rather sit at home then.  
Edit : I'll read both manifestos properly and use my own faculty of reasoning and common sense to decide. Thanks for the input folks! Thank you for this quality post. I really like this apprenticeship point. Training of work force is seriously lacking in India, especially the trades like plumbers, electricians etc. [removed] Looks like the sangh got spooked by the congress manifesto, and the response was to hurriedly put a lot of big numbers together. 25 lakh crore investment for agriculture and 100 lakh crore in infrastrcture in 5 years, just to name two big items on the list.

This might be ok if not for the irony of the sangh asking congress where the money for their schemes will come from. Manifestos of other parties --

I know the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the DMK released their manifestos, but can't find anything on their website. No mention of any manifesto on Aam Aadmi Party, Janata Dal (Secular), YSR Congress, Shiv Sena or Bahujan Samaj Party websites. When no one implements what is written, what’s the point in discussing. How many past governments have fulfilled at least 70% of their manifesto? Am I being dumb or is there something to worry about Simultaneous Elections? Mods can we have this thread stickied? Maybe include discussions of manifestos of other major parties too?

And thanks OP. [deleted] To those of you saying 33% reservation in parliament will lead to proxy women being installed on behalf of their make counterparts: this was the same argument given when panchayats were mandated to reserve one seat out of five for women. This myth has been debunked. Only in a marginal percentage do women act as proxies, otherwise they're always rational autonomous agents (as much as allowed by the party whip). This is a fantastic bill and extremely necessary for all the underrepresented women of our country. Can Anyone please explain what is ""Combating Left Wing Extremism"" in the BJP manifesto is ?
Also why it didn't say much/anything about Right wing Extremism when we have seen visible growth in past couple years ? > Instututions - Congress promises to amend the Anti-Defection Law to provide for instant disqualification of a Member of Parliament or a Member of the State Legislature for proven disobedience to the party’s whip...

No. You can disqualify them for changing sides because that is not what I vote them in for. But you cannot disqualify them for disobeying party orders. That kills democracy.

I vote for my candidate. He acts on my behalf. I do *not* vote for a party slave. It is in my benefit that he can disobey his party. This is the only outlet of a politicians integrity today.

Remove this and we become a farce Amit Shah ki shakal dekh ke toh bilkul mann nahi hua manifesto padhne ka What’s uniform civil code again?

BJP manifesto > * Arts -  **Congress will guarantee artistic freedom**. Artists and craftsmen will enjoy the freedom to express their views in any form without fear of censorship or retribution.

>* Laws -  Omit Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and **make ‘defamation’ a civil offence**;

> * Police reforms - Cause investigations into cases of communal riots, lynchings and gang rapes by a special wing of the State police under the direct command of the State Headquarters of the police.

> * Media - Congress will pass a law to curb monopolies in the media, cross-ownership of different segments of the media and control of the media by other business organisations. Congress will refer cases  of suspected monopolies to the Competition  Commission of India.

> * Laws - **Omit Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code  (that defines the offence of ‘sedition’)** that has been misused

> * Minorities - We will pass a new law in the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha to prevent and punish hate crimes such as mob-engineered stripping, burning and lynching.

NICE!

> * Gender Justice - We will amend the Service Rules to reserve for women **33 per cent of appointments to posts  in the Central Government.**

> * Reservation - Congress promises to amend the Constitution to provide for **reservation in promotion posts for SCs, STs and OBCs.**

Oh. Fuck.

I don't know what to do :( Congress manifesto says it will make the supreme court into a constitutional court, but doesn't the supreme court use the constitution already for its verdicts? Here I can see most of the people are appreciative of the Congress Manifesto as being socially progressive. Never would have imagined something like this 5 years back. 

But many have shown their concern regarding the funding of the NYAY scheme. I want this scheme to work. I just hope Congress gets the funds by taxing the HNIs, like what is being proposed by AOC in the US - **70% Tax on the 10 millionth dollar**. I don't know if Congress govt can pull this off. > * Digital Rights - Pass a law to protect the personal data of all  persons and uphold the **right to privacy;**

Personal Data Protection Bill? I noticed most points in INC's manifesto are measurable goals where BJPs is mostly non-measurable statements... I care mostly about their economic goals. It feels weird when the Congress has more tangible pro-business policies than the BJP. They should’ve included more details around stimulating the economy. Off topic but couldn't the BJP find a better picture for this page? I cannot stop laughing.. [Here, take this pearl of wisdom.](https://i.imgur.com/Beq0IQc.jpg) > Citizenship Amendment Bill - Hindus, Jains, Buddhist and Sikhs escaping persecution from India's neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India.

rohingya muslims have left the chat I have never seen a more whataboutery manifesto than that BJP manifesto I'll gild anyone who does a post of BJP's 2014 Manifesto and list the things they delivered/ did not deliver. BJP's manifesto:
Hindus, Jain's, Buddhists and Sikhs will be given citizenship wtf. Does anyone see major Indian religions missing from this list? Whats with bjps obsession with year 2022?  Can we forget about the manifesto for a second? Went to buy some cement today and was told each bag is 45 rupees more expensive. The shakha daftars of BJP are pocketing that 45 rupees. Can we talk for a second about that? Both the manifestos are a very good reflection of the ideologies of each party. 

BJP remains true to its Hindutva roots. It reiterates a Hindu centric government where:

* Persecuted Indic faiths from neighbouring countries become eligible for citizenship. No such concession given to persecuted Muslims in Burma or Christians/Ahmediyyas in Pakistan. 
* Focus on extermination of left-wing terror. No mention of caste or religious violence that is regularly fanned by sangh outfits. 
* Promising the construction of Ram Mandir.
* Promoting measures to combat the entry of women in Sabarimala.

I can't ideologically agree with amending the constitution to give certain religions a preference when it comes to Indian citizenship. That's not what India is supposed to be. Also, while their stance of abolishing triple talaaq and nikah halala is commendable, their stance on Sabarimala indicates that they are not interested in giving equal rights to women. They are only interested in reforming Islam because it does not anger their core vote base. Regressive practices in both religions should be called out equally.

Congress' manifesto on the other hand champions social justice.

* Abolishing offences of sedition and criminal defamation. 
* Promising no censorship for artists.
* Right to Privacy.
* Increased spending on health and education. 
* Appointing a diversity commission.

It takes social justice to extreme (in my opinion) levels by promising:

* Reservations in promotion.
* Reservations in central government jobs of 33% to women.

Another disturbing factor is the strengthening of the anti-defection law. That, for me, is contrary to the spirit of parliamentary democracy. 

Judging from the manifestos, I believe this will be a watershed election for India. It is time for us to decide whether the identity of India is Hindu or are we a syncretic mix of different religious traditions where diversity is not only respected but celebrated. 
 So far it seems that Congress’s manifesto promises more liberty, freedom and expression, increased institutional accountability, more nuanced defence and internal security policy and some radical economic ideas as well. 
Whereas BJP is parroting the same thing they promised in 2014 or since then with the peculiar target of 2022.
Congress has won this manifesto game (if there is one) by rather giving and presenting a vision, which they have been utterly lacking in these last few years, than targeting BJP with a negative campaign like a threat to country, constitution and institutions which may backfire and not resonate with the larger population that still cares for food, water and jobs. In my opinion this positive campaign and presenting the electorate with something to look forward to is the best thing about the congress manifesto.  Congress has also released a 44 page document prepaered by Lt Gen DS Hooda, the architect of the the 2016 Surgical Strikes. 

National Security Strategy document by Gen Hooda. 

https://manifesto.inc.in/pdf/national_security_strategy_gen_hooda.pdf From the BJP Manifesto, page 32, point 11: 

> Women's security will be given more priority. We have constituted the Women's Security Division in the Home Ministry, and have made strict provisions for transferring the laws **in order to commit crimes against women**, in particular in a time-bound investigation and **trail** for rape. In such cases, forensic facilities and fast track courts will be expanded to bring **convicts** to justice.


* ""In order to commit crimes against women"" - slight Freudian slip there. 
* ""Trail"" - I mean, the road to justice is long in India, but that long?
* ""bringing convicts to justice"" - if they are convicts already, why are you trying them again? Or is guilt supposed to be assumed in these cases? 

Such attention to detail. Aur karo vote for development. 
 Came here to see Mandir lollipop. Was not disappointed. I'd rather drink the Kool Aid at Jim Jones's convention than believe in the BJP manifesto. all of their promises are empty. The only thing they will follow through on is the Ram Mandir temple to pander to their base of ""shit for brains"" Hindu nationalists. 

&#x200B;

Also. nothing on pollution or the environment after they caused the degradation of the environment and made China look like Switzerland. whats wrong with neet examination? Congress's manifesto looks more mature, actionable.

BJP's counterpart reads like rhetoric Given BJP republished the 2014 manifesto, does anyone else see this also acts as a report card for the BJP? BJP seems to have forgotten about the Smart City which is unfortunate. I am surprised by such a civil discussion on politics. We are seeing such a mix of varying ideas. You should see the  r/pol which is political discussion of US. Its a shitshow circlejerk  out there. I think the BJP’s promise of building a warehouse network across the country is an immediate requirement - whether they deliver is an entire different story. Basically BJP is we couldn't finish it in 2019, so by 2022 we'll do it (Their deadline were that from the start maybe to claim it even if they didn't do work). Nothing new to see here.

Congress gives lots of spending goal but not how they will get money, BJP is more like we'll build infra structure but too much infra with no use could lead to bankruptcy like China is doing to other countries.

Many positive things in congress manifesto can be extremely bad e.g. aprenticeship instead of hiring a guy, make him work as aprentice (my brother worked for 3 years as a ""trainee"") low pay and firiable without much problems as they technically wouldn't be considered employee. And how can you force private to do anything and pay for it? How will you enforce it? Courts might strike it down.

Fill jobs: How are there qualified people available? If not how will you fill it? Saw the news article of not enough jobs with 9-12 pics of people with their name, year and degree written on the blackboard behind them. 4 had their degree spelling wrong and 3 were Masters or PhD. I'd rather not hire them in jobs (they had access to internet and everything. I'd rather have a doubtful average guy than a bold stupid guy e.g. Trump)

Application fee waived: Nice but not too costly anyways. People will fill form and not go. Maybe give them a fine if they don't attend as paper is wasted.

Make India manufacturing hub: How? Maybe next points

Make for the world: I see what you did there. Nice idea but I don't think people set up shop in India as we have low tax, our main + is cheap labor, maybe focus more on ITI and skilled labor, give them stipend? And we are reducing our revenue, maybe they'll increase it in other points.

Patent acquisition: DO NOT DO THIS. I don't want government to subsidize industries and which patent would they buy? For small(definitely) to medium(maybe) industries don't follow much of norms and have lot of lee way. No one is going to ask did you pay royalties for the patent? Unless the patent owning company or individual is going around and doing round of small industries in India no one would be the wiser (most of India runs on pirated software and duplicate of original products) don't waste money.

Independent mayor: Really you want more elections and make it confusing people to vote? What will happen if there is an impasse. Blame game and stuff along with partisan politics. From personal experience, grassroots have always been to work for people and you can't BS them. With this it is definitely going to occur.

Urban poor: I guess BPL is poor, protection from arbitrary eviction. You mean if they are living illegally? Won't that be rewarding illegal behavior? If its for legal housing, isn't it already illegal to remove someone from their own home? Shelters are a great idea, include Domestic violence victims as well for shelters. Right to housing isn't this Pradhan mantri avas yojna?

Agriculture law: NO Idea won't comment but I guess it is good.

NYAY yojna: Is it gauranteed 72000 or top up to 72000(you earn 50000, we add 22000)? What stops a poor person from depositing money and just say I lost a job? CASH transfer into a bank A/C of women of the family decide is it cash or account transfer. People can take cash out of bank accounts so terminology I guess. Maybe link this to adhar and make it like food stamps in USA?

GST 2.0: So bread and cigarett, cycle and mercedes will have same tax %? Bad idea.

Bank agglomoration: Actually happening right now many banks are merging. I'm not sure a good idea or bad but its already happening. Job losses possible or no new vacancy for long time with the current process, same in future if they wanna agglomorate more.

Science: Generally government in US produces a white paper every 10 years with experts in field with industrial giants on where the future is and funds are given to them. We need something of this sort. Include academics with industries.

Fisheries: Nice, depends on who is there and how it works however it will be in clash with waterways and road development as EPA is the same.

Internal security: How is terrorism and infiltration of terrorists (not millitants) not the same, what they upgrade from militants to terrorist when they kill people? Maoist/Naxalist are different from terrorist, how? Look up definition. Communal violence or riots are generally done in large groups pretty hard to know who did it, need infra and policy to indentify groups. Also make definition clear if a hindu has fight with muslim because of a parking spot, thats not communal violence.

CAPF: Don't bring politics in army, BJP is doing it and people are giving them flack for it. Once you do some kind of reservation, other options open up and then there will be cast analysis. JUST DON'T

Arts: How will you gaurantee freedom? Employer doesn't want you to do something but you do and get fired. Censorship is prerogative of the media e.g. movies have censor board. Vigilante groups are by default illegal (look up vigilante) and can be punished.

Anti Defection law: I know this is because of Amit Shah, its fine get the law.

Adhaar: Why not expand a prevalent system instead of restricting it. Parliament makes law, so make one.

Diversity Index: Don't. How will you enforce diversity in public companies. Don't we already have reservation? What would this achieve?

State-center: I call BS. Most of the states have BJP rule, congress will flip on this law. Delhi was supposed to be a state, what happened?

Remove minimum education for local bodies. Why? Regressive move.

Judiciary: Constitutional court is wrong, look at US court, they say companies are ""people"" and money is ""speech"" under constitution. Our courts are obsolete in how judges are selected and now this? It'd make them more powerful than parliament as you need 2/3rd majority to amend constitution. Basically giving court right to make a law from a vague law.

Defamation: Not sure.

Sedition: You can shout fire in crowded theatre but you'll be held responsible for the consequences.

AFSPA: I think army does this on its court, but will all cases be considered prima facie true? Where will the cases be prosecuted where it happened or the personel home state. Will he be in jail or suspended?

Media: Ever heard of oligopoly? US has anti monopoly law and there are ways to buy pass the system. Anyways now a days due to internet and mobile phones, media is not that prevalent.

Police reforms: Special wing, nice idea.

Niti Ayog: Changing names basically or wanna have advisary committee back again?

Reservation would be BS. Like in women or SC/ST reservation on seats, they'd just have their wife run the stuff like lalu did with rabdi.

Reservation in promotion: Why? Shouldn't people be judged based on their merit? Maybe use a random person to come and evaluate.

Citizen amendment bill: No surprise here

Minorities: Its already illegal to do hate crime, what is the use of more laws? Implement current one.

Healthcare: Basically what is going on.

Education: How do you plan to increase? Wage, facilities, new schools, universities. Many institutions do not spend what they are given, maybe have administors who are not stingy enough to spend stuff and teach them its not their money but governments?

NEET: Maths guy no idea whats the problem, maybe bio guys can tell.

Environment: Great, what do you plan to do about air pollution.

High speed internet affordable price. Who is going to provide? BSNL?

Right to privacy: Definitely need it but how will you enforce it? Twitter didn't come to parliament in India. Unless you get their data centers and servers in India, this is impossible.

Sorry for typos and If I'm wrong on anything, please feel free to correct me.

Didn't analyze BJP as they have copied their last one and put years at the back nothing new. Maybe will do later. Congress tightening the Anti-Defection law sounds like them trying to save their asses after they have seen so many people switch sides and leave. It is ominous and wrong. Their Agricultural policies on the other hand look promising and much more planned than BJP's.

Can someone explain to me why do they want to abolish Niti Aayog? I'm gonna say it. Congress' is better and more tangible, viable and stuff. BJP is rhetorical, seems last minute. Even though I don't support Congress, I am inclined to say that their manifesto is much better than BJP's. Now if they can project a capable PM candidate, someone who's not a Gandhi then I may consider voting for them. 
 Some very important and achievable things on Congress's manifesto. Specially Net Neutrality, Education and No fees for Gov't exams Congress is way forward.bjp still sticking to its old agenda.nothing was done for the past four years. Communal corrupt jumla v/s corrupt jumla 

I'll take plain corrupt over communal corrupt any day. In my opinion more assertion should be given on education reforms, promoting research and improving quality of higher education. To some extent Congress has thought over it but these points are not given much importance in BJPs manifesto. I like some points from BJP and some from Congress. Am I a centrist now? Whoa.  See the order points listed by BJP - the top ones are just about their core crooked values - the provocative topics which they always use to trigger religious fanaticism. I'm concerned how Congress is going to secure funds for NYAY and education spending bump. One of the articles in Quint did the math for 3L crore needed, it is viable only if existing subsidies like fertilizers, free power,Mengra etc gets stopped. After that also, we would need 1.3 L crore more, but congress said they will not be stopping any existing subsidies. If they stop other subsidies, then NYAY seems possible. If they come to power, they have to atleast give this to some families which after leakages due to corruption will not provide any benefits , full scale implementation is not possible. Their other plans looks good especially on the security plans.  \> **Citizenship Amendment Bill** \- Hindus, Jains, Buddhist and Sikhs escaping persecution from India's neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India.

&#x200B;

I dont get this!! Why based on religion? And in the same manifesto there is talk about uniform civil code What is the manifesto implementation rate? Did the BJP promise demonetisation in the last election?

These documents seem far removed from what governments actually do when in power. 

Ideally, we would vote based on a bullshit ratio of each government, some ratio of arbritrary words said to deeds implemented.

Congress/BJP are both capable of promising you the moon and then delivering you 1.3 billion 56"" spiked dildos to be mandatorily shoved up our 1.3 billion assholes. > * Education - We will take measures to dispense with the NEET examination.

Why? never ending topic >BJP's Menifesto for Muslim women: Ensuring equal rights - We will legislate a bill to prohibit and eliminate practices such as Triple Talaq and Nikah Halala.

Meanwhile BJP's members:

""When I ripped out foetus of a pregnant Muslim woman and put it on the tip of a sword,I felt like maharana pratap""

""Rally in support of rapist and murderers of 8 year old Asifa""

""Dead bodies of Muslim women should be dug out and raped""

""Gangrape & brutalise 5 month pregnant Bilqis Bano, left her for dead and smashes her 2yrs child head against a stone"" >Simulatenous elections - Wea re committed to the idea of simulatenous elections for Parliament, State assemblies and local bodies to reduce expenditure, ensure efficient utilisation of government resources and security forces and for effective policy planning.

Jumla party missed the opportunity to shoot real commitment to this item on the manifesto by refusing to conduct simultaneous elections in j&k. Sign of broken promises to come, in case anyone wonders about those after the 10 crore jobs they promised in the last manifesto turned out to be negative. >for withdrawing allegiance to the party or for supporting another party.

I don't know much about politics so i might be dead wrong but isn't this a ""you cant leave mahagadbandhan or there will be legal consequences"" law? LMAO

Combating Left Wing Extremism - We are committed to taking necessary and effective steps against left wing extremism to eliminate this menance in the next five years. interesting one. thanks for the effort.  

question: why didn't congress do these many things in their previous 10yrs of government?    

observation: there's a lot of freebies promises from both the sides. any word on how they plan to meet these extra expenditures? is it going to be the taxpaying middle class that'll bear the burden yet again ? [removed] Is it too much to ask. For alternate terms for each of them. Both have some good and some not so good points.
The real deal lies in the execution which neither of them would be able to do without a full majority without any alliances. Acche din again? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Congress manifesto talks of filling up all government jobs!

Isnt that worrying? Many government institutions are bloated as is. What is needed is to trim them and make them more efficient. >Application fees for government examinations and government posts will be abolished.

Why??

This is totally wrong. People will fill the form just for fun. Cost will rise exponentially for conducting exams. There is already lack of resources for online exams and f every tom, dick and harry fills the vaccancies I don't how that would work out. 

General/OBC candidates students have to pay a higher amount than SC/ST, it should be bought to same level instead. Am I the only one who read 'Sankalp Patra' as 'Sambit Patra' lmao ?????????? What is the percentage of female candidates in both Congress and BJP? Reservation for women is not priority for them it seems None of the party manifestos address the need for a revision of central investigation unit which functions purely on law and investigates government institutions without fear of reprisals. Also the need for an increase in the number of judges and installation of special courtrooms for smaller offences like drunk driving and small level thefts. Increasing reservation will only create more unequality, this will marginalize the working male class. BJP's manifestos deals with the idea of increasing free market and encourages businesses which will boost our economy and create jobs. NYAY is one of the stupidest ideas of Congress so far. They want to assign such a huge amount of money to people who are basically doing NOTHING. Instead of empowering them, Congress is working towards making them complacent towards their status as poor. This sends such a terrible message and example throughout the  country that its ok to not do anything, government will take care of everything. Well communists of the whole world thought that and look what happened to them, they have 100 million dead bodies to show that this idea doesn't work. Bjp has that stupid part about Ram Mandir again which is never going to happen, not unless we violate the constitutional ammendments. None of the party has anything regarding reforming education in India and promoting research and development. Overall the Congress manifesto is more lucretive though many points are almost impossible to achieve and some are downright nonsense. Bjp has a small manifesto but some clear stupid alt right leaning goals but India will profit more from their visions than Congress. Then again when have either of these parties done what was written in their manifestos. Once again, both the parties have made impressive manifestos. Even if they deliver on 1/3 of the promises made, India will be in a better place than it is today. The first thing before deciding whom to vote should be, to get to know who are the candidates. That individual is gonna promise the basic needs for your constituency and if not then please just don't send a puppet to the assembly, whom you can't find when you need him in your constituency.
Then comes the part where you think of a larger perspective i.e which party, for the power. That totally depends on the analysis that you do by yourself. Just see around what's happening and not just by following the puppet media.
I'm a first time voter and still waiting to know who all are gonna run from my constituency because the present one whenever comes to ground ends on participating in open mic. *sings song for us* You here didn't understand my point, what's NYAY scheme is and what the construction of statues are.
Construction which will never repay us that we know very well if we check the stats.
Now what I'm trying to tell you is this from an article published on:- https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/view-india-can-actually-benefit-from-nyay-but-conditions-apply/articleshow/68822001.cms

If 50 million families were to directly benefit, NYAY could cost $52 billion, or 2% of GDP (while currently existing consumer subsidy schemes are 3% of GDP).
Carefully just read the last line in brackets. I guess now you'll understand that actually this NYAY or UBI type module works in big countries, so we can also with help of great economist of the proud country work on scheme like this.
Also if you find time just try to go through BJP manifestos and then go to Congress you'll understand what clearly is vision and what are vague promises.

Happy that you actually send me the family survey. Kudos👍 is there a way to summarize this whole discussion? Could anyone tell me how much of the 2014 manifesto they accomplished? Is it worth believing in BJP at all? After seeing these 5 years I just feel despair to know that many of my class mates think BJP is actually good (Not saying Congress is good.) 
I really wish they change NOTA to actually mean something someday. So how much faith can I actually put in their manifestos? How much of the claims are actually delivered? How much can I expect? 'Left-wing extremism™' comprises of:

1. Opposition parties that ask questions of the ruling party 



2. Journalists exercising their professional and moral duty of reporting 'facts'



3. Writers and activists exercising their rights to speak their minds 



4. And basically anybody saying anything even *remotely* critical of the Supreme leader and his fascist, terroristic Hindutva ideology
 This is a high quality and much needed post. This should be here till the elections are ongoing. 

What the hell is wrong with BJP? Their manifesto is a precursor to India's bleak future. 

Someone please spread the word that there is more to this world than communal violence and divide. there goes the chance that i vote for congress.

&#x200B;

bjp it is! Congress's manifesto is thousand times better than BJP's one.

Congress's manifesto is pro-democracy while BJP is straight out want to end democracy, Simultaneous election is the biggest proof of it.

 Personally, I find that goals of the BJP manifesto are more attainable than that of the congress. Congress's goals to be implemented (keeping aside the rampant corruption that it displayed in the UPA regime) require a serious change in fiscal policies leading to unwarranted increases in tax liabilities across the middle income earners. My professional background as CA, LLB sees a point scored by the BJP strictly from the attainability standpoint. Sometimes, less is more.

Coming to the target audience, it's very clear what both parties are looking for. Like a broken record, BJP focuses on the ""right wing"" Hindu votes while congress prefers its ""minority"" vote bank (the Gandhi's literally appealed to the Muslim community to ask them not to vote for BJP).

So far my take is that BJP has an edge over the congress. I want a lot of what Congress is promising but I know it's not all gonna happen. Hell, I'd be surprised if they efficiently deliver on 5% of the promised stuff. The only thing I don't agree with on Congress' manifesto is  reservation in promotion posts for SCs, STs and OBCs. Just no. That was not what was decided post-independence. Quotas and reservations were meant to continue for a short term to bring the SC, ST, OBCs upto speed. All reservations must be removed with immediate effect so everyone gets a fair chance. The general category has been languishing as far as jobs are concerned, for decades now.

Speaking of which, one important thing to note is that no party's manifesto has openly promised creating jobs for people. That's the most important issue right now, at least for lakhs of youngsters across the country. Disappointed that neither of them didn't even bother to mention it. BJP still has to depend on Ram Mandir for votes. India comprises diverse cultures and traditions. It's a composite of religions and tribes. It's not easy to bring a uniform civil code for all. BJP is just using them as a tool to win votes. 
 Repealing Article 370 is not the solution to Kashmir issue. It should be dealt through integrating Kashmiris with the mainstream Indian culture. Sure it takes time. Mere military measures will further worsen the situation. 
BJP feeds on Hindu emotions and exploit them. Looks like BJP is serious about the Kashmir issue. If they really have the balls to abolish 370, maybe they should be given a chance. But it looks like a far cry in the light of recent statements given by Mehbooba Mufti. I cannot  take congress seriously when  once again they are propping up the idiot  Rahul and now even his sister has joined in,they should realize that Gandhi family has screwed over the majority of  people in India  (multiple times) too,many of them will vote for BJP even though they know they are not right for the country. I feel the Congress manifesto to be a lollipop.

They want to give ₹72,000 to each poor person every year, the burden of this would be on the tax payer. 

Also, they had 60 years to fullfill their promises, why have they waited so long? 

 Jumla patra Conspicuous by its absence: Cow protection and black money! But tell me how many Governments have lived up to their manifesto?? These are cheap baits and nothing else. Idk if someone has pointed it out yet, but - 

Congress manifesto says - 

a) we'll provide RS. 72,000 / family to the bottom 20% every year

b) we'll have a single, ""moderate"" GST

There are only 2 possibilities - 

1) they'll increase income tax or bring up a new tax

2) they won't fulfill their promise

EDIT: 3) increase fuel prices

Of which, one is a well, and the others - ditch. That ram mandir thing in bjp manifesto. India is a secular country you can’t just do that . Just leave the land . It won’t effect anyone’s belief if there is one less mandir. Mandir jo banayega, vote wohi payega. Hijacking this thread to ask a question...

So... I don't have my voter's card yet, how do I apply and get it in time?

I was to get it made, but recently we shifted homes so our address proof has to be changed, so what will I show as my address proof?

Plus I have moved out of my house for my first job, living in a PG...

Kindly do suggest the best course of action, I have to vote... probably better to discuss how much work was done by both parties from previous manifesto Sab Lamba Lamba fek Raha hai. Neither will do anything and make it even worse Why aren't we getting some young whippersnappers instead of these same old ones ? Am I missing something? I don't see any point in the INC manifesto about urban mobility or mobility in general? 

Moreover, I don't think it's possible to avoid that point since it's being shown that improving public transit systems increase the economic growth of the country.

Another point, I see a few changes taking place in Bangalore with regards to this. For example, they have started to regulate and make available licences for bicycle sharing companies. They have also started building up the infrastructure, though it's taking some time. Congress states that there are vacancy for jobs then what's the problem with bjp to fill them up. Criticism over job would be over. Thanks for this. I’m actually scared to visit the sites of these parties for fear of those pesky web cookies. What a cluster fuck. The scariest and most worrisome part about this for is the anti defection law. What is manifesto.. Sorry I am just not aware Eliminating TB by 2025? Oof that's quite the promise. Just this week we studied three recent TB cases in our college. How much of what the BJP promised last time has been upheld? ""BJP Manifesto doesn't allow to copy text (even though it is a PDF document)."" 

I can copy it. Where is my ₹15 lakh promised by Modi? If note ban is so successful, from where these currency notes worth crore of rupees are coming for distribution to voters? Why the hell is the Ram Mandir in the manifesto? Can a party looking to form a government promise construction of religious stuff? Isn't that against the model code of conduct? Both the Manifestos look so *perfect* but the elected government will forget their promises within a month. I kinda see the manifestos being split across, BJP going pro-business, Congress going pro-human / society.

Wonder if   
>Digital Rights - Uphold the principle of net neutrality.  

Includes porn. Are people taking these manifestos seriously? Please just check out your local candidate and decide if they seem like people who are honest and can deliver. These manifestos are just propaganda stuff compiled by people who don't even stand for the elections. The problem is not the contents of the manifestos but whether they can deliver that. 
The past government does not have any credible track record, so it doesn't matter if they promise moon and stars. The need for minimum income guarantee scheme is and direct indication of failure of previous government at economic empowerment of people of country. The poor conditions of roads across the country is another such indication. Unavailability of uninterrupted electricity after a government being so long in power does not inspire any credibility.
I like the track record of the current government. This government has rolled out various schemes successfully. The schemes have gone through design and implementation phase pretty fast. Now I do agree that these schemes haven't reached everyone but on the other end expecting them to reach 1.2 bn people in time of mere less than 5 years is very unfair. \>Uniform Civil Code

Science/Technology,Need some career guidance (CS/IT),11,e2wq78,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e2wq78/need_some_career_guidance_csit/,7,"Hi,

I'm in final year(about to give 7th sem exams) doing B.Tech in CSE from a tier 3 college.

My problem is I don't know where to put my time into.

From the people I have talked to, I know Data Structures, Algorithms and problem solving is a **must** for big companies and if I want to actually succeed in this industry but most of the job description of startups are like some knowledge of popular technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, Python, Django, React, Angular, Vue, Data  Science, Machine Learning and that too with a requirement of 1 or 2+ years.

I'm overwhelmed by everything! Though I'm already placed in an MNC with <4lpa package through campus placement, I want to get a better paying job as a software developer/engineer.

I have done some *not so fascinating* projects in Python and JavaScript but Idk if I should continue or just say fuck it to all the languages/frameworks etc and just invest my time into HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces etc but unfortunately a lot of good companies which ask for DSA problems don't even consider tier 3 grads so learning some stack then becomes kinda important to me. I don't know. 

I think a lot and then don't do shit. Pls tell me what should I do, where should I focus more to get a decent job now. I'll graduate next year.",silver3forlife," Do invest your time in courses outside campus.
They surely boost your chances for better package You cannot do just one. You need to know both technologies and have problem solving ability. PSA builds by more practice, whereas knowledge of a framework comes with a little less. 

You have to choose b/w full stack dev, data analyst, and other options. Stick to one path,  learn the tech (take a month or less and learn it through a project that you can upload on GitHub), and then start practicing from hackerearth, etc. Don't try to become the best programmer, instead try to crack the interview. Go through geeksforgeeks and in maybe 2 months have an understanding of the algos and types of questions asked. Then start applying.",2019-11-28 19:19:37

I have a couple of questions. 

1. How did you find the syllabus different from regular run of the mill engineering college.
1. How would you rate the seriousness and dedication of fellow students. 
1. The website tells me that most students do an internship at one of the ISRO facilities. Did you get such an opportunity ? How was your experience ? Did you contribute to an actual projects (even if in minuscule way)
1. And finally what's the employment situation like. Do a lot of people get absorbed into ISRO ? Do a lot of people like that or do you see a lot of ""brain drain"" ?
",misddit," No idea about IIST, but ISRO regularly launches various student satellites which piggyback with the main payloads.

Some friends of mine were involved in one and they got place their satellite in the rocket and monitor it from their base station etc. Pretty exciting stuff.

Science/Technology,Career change advice,23,dhmqee,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dhmqee/career_change_advice/,26,"I'm working as a Software Developer in a startup for 2 years (changed jobs a few times). But I don't enjoy my job and I dread to go to office on Mondays. I'm no technology enthusiast and have no ""love"" for programming/developing/whatever else to do with tech.

So, I've decided to give myself a 2 month deadline to decide what other career to choose. And withing one month of deciding, I'll quit my job and embark on that new career. But, as of now, I'm looking for various options and I'm wondering whether you guys can help. So, here's my background/interests to help you help me:

1) Education: BE in CS branch. Abysmal Percentage/GPA.

2) 2 years of experience in Software field, of which I have no interest to continue. Neither am I interested in Data Science/AI or whatever other crappy buzzword that often gets thrown around.

3) I'm interested in Sociology/History/Literature/Politics etc. Can spend whole day in front of a book. Can spend time without getting bored watching, reading about these topics.

4) I'm a bit shy and introverted, but I'm confident of overcoming those.

5) No pressure to earn more money. Would be satisfied with bear minimum of 10-20k per month.

6) Ready to pursue any course in any other field (Banking etc) 

So, please guys, I'm really serious and I feel like I'm risking it all. So, please restrain from sarcasm and mockery.",justoneadvice," If you're sure about point 3,
Then try UPSC or SSC exams
i.e. IAS IPS or CDS Points number three and five are the most interesting. My advice would be to look into the fields of journalism and the social sector/NGOs et cetera. The most important thing is networking with the people working or planning to work in this field. The easiest way to do that is to get a degree in this field. So, look into Asian College of Journalism, Symbiosis, Tata Institute of Social Sciences and JNU. Also, familiarise yourself with the top names in this field, both organisations and individuals. So, for example, if you want to work on the environment there is Centre for Science and Environment and Sunita Narain. If you want to do something in politics, there's Yogendra Yadav and Swaraj Abhiyan. If you want to work on rural issues there's P Sainath and People's Archive of Rural India. There's also the Teach for India Fellowship which pays around 20K a month I believe and the deadline to submit applications for this year may still be open. If you get it, then you can build connections in this field without necessarily studying for a degree. Become a govt librarian. Maybe? > Would be satisfied with bear minimum of 10-20k per month. 

For how long? Some of the options would pay you 10k for the rest of your life. How about being a history teacher? The main problem I see is that 3 can't be substantiated by 2 or 1. If you feel like switching to arts background go ahead,   don't mind what others say. There are tons of good courses available especially in DU and all where people are desperately trying to get into. Arts may be not holding the stature as engineering in our country but these are the areas in which we need more experts which one day you might just become. TC? YOE? What about doing an MBA and switching to product management? Look at a law degree of money is not an issue",2019-10-14 14:37:53

After 10th, I choose commerce due to peer pressure and not thinking about it. I would have done SCIENCE and pursued computer engineering.
I am been fascinated by computers and games since I was a kid.
I have 3 years into LLB and I wish to teach myself
1. programming
2. Hacking
3. Making 2D games or android games
4. Making apps
5. Making websites


I want to work from home, even possible be a bug bounty hunter or white hat hacker or work of police cyber cell department.


I am serious in this and will dedicate upwards of 6 hours everyday for 3 years.
Is self learning possible, so th I can do something great in field of technology??",7daystogo," Yes. Self taught programmers are a plenty. Practice makes perfect. 

Also Patent Attorneys are a thing and can be a fulfilling career for many. Think about being cyber law expert Of course self learning is possible but please be realistic about the kind of time you can dedicate to it. You're a full time student on top of that do you genuinely think you can add 6 hours of work in a day, everyday?     

Be more clear about what you want to learn, broad terms like 'programming' and 'hacking' mean nothing and everything else you have listed is a subset of programming. Not that it is wrong to start from 0, but researching what you want to learn at this stage will benefit you a lot.    
  
List out very clearly what you need to do, make a schedule of what you need to do when and weekly track your progress and tweak your program accordingly. The most difficult thing about self learning is getting the discipline to do it and for it to be lasting experience you need to be realistic about the number of hours you can give without burning out.   
  
You can make a great career for yourself in 3 years even if you are starting from 0.  OSSU is a great list of curated courses, you don't have enough time to do all of them but you do have enough time to learn whatever aligns with your career goals. Also restricting yourself to just MOOCs is quite fruitless, make projects, try contributing to open source projects (since you are a registered student you are eligible for GSOC please look into that), and get relevant internships in startups(since the bigger companies will shy away from you at this point).  
  
 Again I would like to emphasize be clear about your goals and asking specific questions will fetch you much better and much more useful responses from everyone. You should join [PwnSquad](https://pwnsquad.net/)

It is A Discord programming community that welcomes people of all skillsets

We share cool learning resources, solve challenges and do fun :D Just go for it, most of the computer geniuses are college dropouts anyway 1) Easy to call yourself programmer

2) Pick a language, ideally C++, spend a year or two at it, move to Assembly language, learn writing assembly go to reverse engineering then learn package injection, hooks and sdk development to hack yourself

3) 2D games : Few months of experience will teach you to code games in epic. Unity is pretty easy

4) Making website is easy but again to be reallygood at it you will have to learn java, packet handling server side fetching and a lot of stuffs... which you will learn as you progress but sole focus is not worth unless you want to be Web developer. Trust me self thought programmers are all around our country. A lot of them even shit over the ""professionally/academically certified"" ones. Sorry if it offends anyone.

Honestly I feel if you can embrace the concept of approaching and solving problems and understand how to convert it into code syntactically (heck: even a pseudo code or an understanding as to how it may be executed), you are a programmer. Just embrace the concepts, keep your code simple, try to work towards improving code efficiently and don't jump around a lot on everything that glitters. If you start a concept, finish it or atleast have a good understanding before jumping to the next one. Have lots of hands on experience and be patient and steady while proceeding rather than reactive and erratic. Wish you all the best for your venture.

Science/Technology,Let Us Begin the Next Decade Our Way,9,ehzmtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ehzmtp/let_us_begin_the_next_decade_our_way/,0,"Today, the end of a decade is upon us. While dates are just markers of time, they also have a psychological effect, the transition in to something new. On the eve of a new decade, this is my message to my fellow friends.

Friends,

Almost all of us have lived through the past decade. Some of you have even seen another momentous shift, ushering in the new millennium; while others have seen more of these events passing by.

The last ten years have redefined the way we live, and we are now even closer to each other. Things that were science fiction to a kid in the 1990s is a reality. Yet, we are using technology not to express ourselves but divide who we are collectively as humans. Algorithms are segmenting and compartmentalizing us on the basis of not only our ethnicity, but also our choices, our preferences and our actions. We are using all of the benefits of our interconnected ways in the worst ways possible; using it to gang up, humiliate and shame those that don't agree to our thoughts. We are still waging wars, and selling ourselves to be slaves for things that are pointless in the grand scheme of things.

However, today; you can stop that. You, yes you. You have the power to change, to redefine, to come together and fight all of the differences whose seeds are sown across our collective psyche. It is you who has the power to change your own life, and the power to change the lives of others around you. You may think you are an insignificant part amongst billions of people, but you're not. Today is the day you have the capability to lead by example, to create a harmonious future for the generation that comes after us, and most importantly, for yourself.

It is normal to fear, because I am afraid, more of myself and of failing others, but I am more afraid of failing to provide a better life for the next generation. But, it has to have a start somewhere, so why not today? I don't ask you of anything, but to do what your conscience thinks is right.

Thank you for reading.

**Manmohan Singh** (Punjabi born 26 September 1932) is an Indian economist and politician who served as the Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014. The first Sikh in office, Singh was also the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after completing a full five-year term. Born in ***Gah (now a part of Punjab, Pakistan).*** Singh's family migrated to India during its partition in 1947. After obtaining his doctorate in economics from Oxford, Singh worked for the United Nations during 1966–69. He subsequently began his bureaucratic career when Lalit Narayan Mishra hired him as an advisor in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Over the 70s and 80s, Singh held several key posts in the Government of India, such as Chief Economic Advisor (1972–76), governor of the Reserve Bank (1982–85) and head of the Planning Commission (1985–87).

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Satyamev Jayate.",toughbrain," 1. Are you anywhere else other than facebook?
2. Don't you think Humanism is a highly misunderstood word and it might only drive people away if getting people to you is your idea?
3. I see you have a highly ambitious vision (though vague here) is really appreciable. I will take a peek into it. Aaaah, the walls of text just got 10 feet higher. Damn, that took a while to settle in! I really like the fact that someone in India is actually trying to setup grass roots for humanity development and management.

A few tips from my side:

1) It'd be really awesome if you had a subreddit, cuz Facebook can become really Obnoxious, what with all the meme pages, and all the hundreds of friends that people can have. Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.

2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first? Cuz I think if you'd start with one, you might slowly reach state-level, which is more than enough to get the nation's attention. I like your long term approach. Anything is possible with tenacity and will power. Good luck to you. The trouble with your plan is that it will strike the vast majority of Indians as being culturally inauthentic. The idea as presented simply is not Indian. It is just an artificial and weird mish-mash of a lot of things that seem to look good at this stage in history (2019), but it doesn't have deep roots in the soul and soil of the land.

BJP is successful because they have a vision for India that (as per their narrative) is as ancient as our earliest recollections of India itself. This vision is made of songs and stories and Gods and saints that are deeply embedded in a lot of Indians' consciousness and their understanding of who we are. They can cite ancient scriptures as sources of the values they advocate. Their imagery and rhetoric have deep roots in the nation's history. Take the icon of mother India or Bharat Mata. Some say that this idea is just a copy of the corresponding European ideas, but every Hindu sees Bharat Mata as just another instance of Shakti, the mother goddess, which is an idea that has deep roots in the Hindu psyche nourished by a vast fund of religious literature and practices.

>	Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition

What RSS achieved over 50 years is only possible if you believe strongly in one ideology. Religion and their rules are a tool to make people cooperate on a large scale, without which they will not. 

I feel it's impossible to create organized movements in that kind of way anymore, unless you use a strong ideology to unite people. But if you do that, it will create blind faith and extremism and that will be counter your original purpose. Moreover, it will counter act against one of the most important qualities that people need in India - Individualism. 

Look at the best countries across the world, they don't have any popular organized groups throughout the country. The Vegan community is the closest comparision I can think of in those countries and even vegans are famous for being intolerant, adhering to their strictly enforced guidelines within the community. As soon as you place the identitiy of a community or a group above an individual, it will lead to the same result. The devloped countries and their institutions are succesful because the majority doesnt beleive in any single ideology strongly, all of them value individual thoughts so it becomes impossible to compromise everything, all at once. 

Therefore, I don't think you should try to replicate their success. But I also don't know a solution to how it can be possible to impart these important values without making under a banner. I really like this idea, and to be honest I was thinking of something like this myself. I'd really like to join, or at the very least contribute to discussions and present ideas and solutions.
 In addition, somebody mentioned here that the ideology might not appeal to Indians the same way that hindutva does and I believe their statement holds a lot of truth. AAP is an example, so it should be a priority to figure out how to strongly appeal to the masses. 

Overall, I want to thank you for being the change you want to see and for actually doing something lol. Please make a sub, not everyone of us are in FB. Police Reforms are the key to unlock the India's potential, How else do you think we can bring fear in the minds of criminals in India? If this takes off, it'd be great!  
I look forward to casting my vote for the IhP one day!

&#x200B;

My only concern is, I don't think your message and philosophy will resonate with the same electorate that voted 'Hindutva Eva Jayate' into power. What's your views on North south cultural divide, LGBT rights? And I'd like to repeat a question someone else had raised is there any place you'd begin, a movement starts only if you begin and progress continually. Indians: Neva! > But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. 



This statement is similar to that of Holocaust deniers. Caste system and discrimination are sins of ancestors, you can't say Muslim are responsible, or reservation cemented caste identities.


I would like to see study or source which says caste identities were less fixed before implementation of reservation in 1947. I repeat, your statement is similar to telling Jewish people that Nazis were not responsible for Holocaust. You can't whitewash thousand year history.






> This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.


Mandal politics came as reply to kamandal politics. Dalits voted Lalu yadav because ranveer Sena did yadav/dalit massacres. Check the links between murli manohar Joshi and ranveer Sena.



Poverty in backward castes was reduced from 1991. Incidentally that was the time when caste based identity politics started. Your claims that identity politics has hurt dalits won't be accepted by even forward castes.










> Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world.

250 million dalits are richer than ST and Muslims. Check facts.

> We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. 

Lol. I can't even. 

> When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. 


It's not about education, it's about ""equal opportunity"". You stop discrimination and it's enough for dalit progress.

> This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system.

How can you give justice to 70% SC,ST,OBC when there is zero judge in supreme Court from these castes? What about 90% supreme Court judges being brahmins?



> We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community 

Are you quoting Sumitra mahajan and her chocolate and kids comment about dalits?

> on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.


But there is persuasive evidence for that. 

> Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.







Your assumption that SC,ST wont vote for you if you said anything against reservation is absurd. You have freedom of expression which dalits respect. BJP is against reservation. In Bengal and Karnataka there are 24% dalits per state. Whole BJP victory in WB, Karnataka, Orissa was possible because of dalits. More dalits voted for NDA than UPA.



You should have taken advice from some social science professor before writing this. It'd be really helpful if you added in links in your post. 

Also, kudos to taking the effort to trying to make a change. Atleast, you haven't given up like me ✌️ How naive to assume that the social, economic, and political inequality is not due to caste and just by providing jobs every issue will be solved. This is the problem of this sort of liberal, we all are equal, agenda, it presumes that opportunities are equally available for all. Whereas it overlook the fact that how Dalits and Adivasis are still discriminated and killed for even attaining some kind of social mobility. props to people who read the entire thing👏

It would be nice to add a tl;dr in the end tho🤠 You will certainly have support from Enlightened youth who are of small proportion.But Its gonna take decades for good amount of common people to support and follow your party, Like you mentioned it's gonna take a long time. But I hope you progress swiftly. Humanist? Yeh kaun jaat hai? What is your take on illegal immigration from Bangladesh ? Maybe a TL;DR at the beginning to give readers a vague idea about what's followed. What's your take on Christian missionaries and Islamic extremism? Our philosophy is to leave the existing reservation system untouched - you lost me on that one. 

If the reservation systen has not changed anything in 70 years, why should it stay on?

Why should we have a system where merit is not the primary criteria and group after ethnic group agitates to name themselves as backward - Jats and Marathas? Not calling yourself an atheist organisation is fine and dandy because we know how scary that word is to the uneducated, but trying to exclude ""secular"" doesnt make sense. Most of the policies your organisation supposedly stands for I can get behind, so I still want to see where this goes. Good luck. If you mean Hindutva as a religion, then definitely yes. But Hindutva as our culture/race can't be removed from us. Because that is what we are. Everyone can practice any religion or adopt a newer one, but the race is not a matter of choice. BJP is totally losing it by mixing Hindutva as a religion and Hindutva/Bharatiya as a race. You taken a look at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanist_Party_India ? If you are against affirmative action and reservation then that is terrible. Shows that you have put zero thought into your policies and are just rambling. This is not going anywhere. Atrocities against dalits are increasing and your solution is to take away the one helpful ladder they have? Won't lie, I am from right wing but I'll defect if you abolish reservation. You have my vote. Are you have an AMA . Fat Chance. You will not come to power even in 1000 years as your ideas needs people with good reasoning skills - asking questions was never encouraged in India. Yawn ! 😪 I consider myself humanist. I see few fundamental issues which I figured through lot of introspection. These seem straightforward but no one follows these:

i) Do not give freedom of speech to a group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of speech

ii) Do not give freedom of religion to group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of religion

iii) Do not give property rights to group/person who campaigns to abolish property rights 

iv) Do not give human rights to persons who work against human rights.

and so on.

Criticism welcome. This naturally eliminates commies, jihadis, anti fos activists, criminals etc. and yet is 'humanist' in nature.

Logic is systems should have survival instincts else they die, however noble they may be. It this gonna be a face for new BJP .",2019-05-27 19:36:02

Are you tired of simplistic lock and key analogies which pervade most legal and policy discourse surrounding encryption? The last year has seen encryption technologies become a subject of intense discussion in courts and within the government. In India and several other countries, there are demands to weaken encryption through backdoors and key escrow systems to facilitate easier access to information for law enforcement agencies. At the same time, encryption is also one of the few tools available to individuals to protect themselves from surveillance by Big Brother and Big Tech. 

To bring greater clarity and technical rigour to the public discourse surrounding encryption, Internet Freedom Foundation is hosting a lecture on **‘Encryption, Security and Privacy in the Digital Age’** by **Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran** on **Saturday, 23 November 2019** from **6:30 PM to 8:00 PM** at the **Constitution Club, New Delhi**. Dr. Prabhakaran is a Chair Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and he specialises in cryptography. Through this public lecture, Dr. Prabhakaran will explain the technical aspects of encryption in a comprehensible but nuanced manner and discuss the importance of cybersecurity and online privacy in light of contemporary developments.

We would be delighted if you could join us for the public lecture and [**you can register for the event here**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/encryption-pe-charcha-a-public-lecture-by-dr-manoj-prabhakaran-tickets-81279764965).

Science/Technology,The Modi Government's Pseudoscience Drive Is More Than an Attack on Science,144,9j9tmo,https://thewire.in/the-sciences/the-modi-governments-pseudoscience-drive-is-more-than-an-attack-on-science,44,,nuclearpowerwalah," Superpower 2020 yay >A textbook that claims India invented batteries millennia before someone in Europe did is a weapon in this movement but does not embody the movement itself. **Attempts to make this textbook go away will not make future textbooks go away,** and attempts to counter the government’s messaging using the language of science alone will not suffice. For example, good education is key, and our teachers, researchers, educationists and civil society are a crucial part of the resistance. But **even as they complain about rising levels of mediocrity and inefficiency, perpetrated by ceaseless administrative meddling, the government does not seek to solve the problem as much as use it as an excuse to perpetrate further mediocrity and discrimination.**

>There was no greater proof of this than when a member of the** National Steering Committee** constituted by the Department of Science and Technology to **“validate research on panchgavya”** told The Wire in 2017, “With all-round incompetence [of the Indian scientific community], this is only to be expected. … **If you had 10-12 interesting and well-thought-out good national-level R&D programmes on the table, [the ‘cowpathy’] efforts will be seen to be marginal and on the fringe. But with nothing on the table, this gains prominence from the government, which will be pushing such an agenda.”**

>But **we do have well-thought-out national-level R&D programmes**. **If** they are **not being picked by the government**, it must be **forced to provide an explanation as to why, and justify all of its decisions, instead of letting it bask in the privilege of our cynicism and use the excuse of our silence to sustain its incompetence**. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s **textbook exists in the wider political economy of banning beef, lynching Dalits, inciting riots, silencing the media and subverting the law, and not in an isolated silo labeled ‘Science vs. Pseudoscience’.** It is a call to action for academics and everyone else to protest the MHRD’s decision and – without stopping there – for everyone and the academics to vocally oppose all other moves by public institutions and officials to curtail our liberties. BC the vice president of the country was a chief guest in a homeopathic college in my city yesterday.  Jhooth bolo baar baar jooth boolo,Jo bhi bol Sakte hai ,sab jooth bolo.jahaan bhi bol sakte Hain jooth boolo.jitni baar bol sakte Hain jooth bolo.jooth boolo jooth boolo jooth bolo problem with teaching kids we had airplanes or batteries or nuclear weapons is THERE IS NO PROOF, so instead of searching for evidence (Archaeological or otherwise) we are just boasting a claim.

&#x200B;

It might be true but you have to prove it before you print and start teaching kids, a lot of research is needed at scholarly level Modi government want every child to sell tea like how lord Modi did. And then they complain about brain drain I want to bring the children of India towards science. This is the only way to kill pseudoscience and superstitions.  I wish I had enough money to start a project that takes scientific education to every part of India.  This would be a journal of BJP stupidity in printed forget, See, people who are dumb, lazy, without an iota of critical thinking, comepletely superstitious, are very easy to subdue and control. You can guess what their endgame is. What's the end game?

Is this just another jumla to win more elections?

Don't they want to actually run the country for about 20-30 years?

Are they all one day going to get up and scoot to Antigua, Nigeria and UK?

Ambani cannot run away like Choksi or Modi did.

Nor can the Sangh.

Can't they see that the first chance that China sees of a broken country, they will try to control the country?

What's the 20 year game plan of Shah?

Winning elections is cool and I respect their awesome skills at manipulating everybody and everything without hacking EVMs, but in the end, where is this headed?

A feudal India is just waiting to be colonised or defeated economically to the point of virtual colonisation like China is doing with African and some Central and West Asian nations. USA is on the decline. China isn't going to stop till it becomes _the_ biggest superpower.

Modi can't see how he is dismantling the country because he is a psycopath who has achieved his life goal and is rudderless. He already has become King Emperor. There's nothing left to do.

But what's with the Sangh and Shah?

The Sangh plans well, like an expert Sith Lord waiting for decades.

I don't see an endgame here that benefits them - unless they really truly believe in a 1800s or 1700s culture as being the best for India. Then we are truly in the grip of a mad cult.

But I doubt that. Ambani, of all people, has serious vision. Will he step in and become PM? If not openly, by proxy?

Doesn't he have a vision for a billion and half potential slaves?

He has to understand economics really well, right?

Disposable incomes and all that.

What's the Sangh's endgame?

With Congress / UPA you could see that the endgame is simple - stay in power, do 20% good, 30% bad and 50% negligence - and just always stay in power. That 20% good was RTI and stable economy and all that.

With this Govt, there is literally no real 20% good.

There's only madness of one kind or another - cow, Mandir, vedic supremacy, ""China is bad"" while everything patriotic is owned by or made in China, Swachch Bharat is a joke, DeMo was a scam, GST is a disaster, Aadhar is a conspiracy.

Kuch to long term socha bhi hai ki nahi?

I can forgive Modi being a fool. He is a megalomaniac. But I cannot digest that all of them are fools and nobody is asking them to look at the bigger picture or the longer term.

They're behaving like day traders when they own the stock exchange. 

Who does that level of stupidity?

They are the house and they are gambling as if they need to win desperately. What gives?

Are they sure that they will not win more than once?

Is this all a 10 year con with their full knowledge that they cannot get a 3rd term?

If this is a 10 year con, which country are they going to flee to?

I just don't get it.

Even poor saps like me invest in insurance and pensions to make savings for 30 years down the future. 

Why isn't the BJP doing this?",2018-09-27 12:35:03
Science/Technology,"IFF submits comments to the Standing Committee on Science & Tech highlighting worries with the DNA Bill, 2019.",4,dygb7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dygb7l/iff_submits_comments_to_the_standing_committee_on/,0,"## 

https://preview.redd.it/d72pn1hu0lz31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4991e7d0a5538ee0d02b5efbffb901dcb86ffd34

## Tl;dr

The DNA Bill is back. The DNA Bill aims to regulate the use and outputs of DNA technology in certain cases and has been the subject of many a debate. It was introduced once again in July 2019 in the Lok Sabha after having lapsed in 2018. It was then referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change on October 18.  The Committee invited comments on the Bill till November 18 and oh, did we have a lot of comments.

## What's it all about?

India has been attempting to introduce legislation that regulates DNA technology since the early 2000's but thankfully has been largely unsuccessful until recently, making our fears quite real. The current DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 has seen a number of redrafts bringing it to its present form and yet continues to be problematic.

We're grateful to be able to voice these concerns as the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change has invited comments on the Bill after it was referred to them. Unfortunately, as submissions made cannot be fully public prior to the Committee publishing their report, so we highlight our major concerns to give you an understanding of why we think the DNA Bill not only needs to undergo further work but also needs to be introduced only after a solid data protection law is in place.

## A few of our very many concerns

* *No data protection legislative framework*: With no overarching data protection legislation in India, the lack of obligation within the Bill to ensure protection especially by the DNA Laboratory as a either mere collectors or even processors of the DNA collected, have no alternative safeguards in place to remedy data breaches or ensure informed consent. Similarly, there is nothing to govern the sharing of such sensitive data, ensuring purpose limitation is maintained.
* *Profiling and surveillance:* DNA profiles can reveal extremely sensitive information about an individual such as their skin colour, illness, susceptibility to diseases and any access to such intrusive information can be misused to specifically target individuals with their own genetic data and is particularly worrying as it could be used to incorrectly link a particular caste/community to criminal activities. Further, in the event that such a databases are then linked to others worrying databases in existence, it is bound to give rise to Government conducted mass surveillance.
* *Overbroad provisions:* Our submission tackles the lack of legitimate use by the Bill; it indicates that DNA technology intends to be used for extremely wide criminal and civil purposes (**alarm bells are ringing**). We argue that the Bill as such extensive databasing of DNA data requires to meet the conditions set by the Supreme Court's judgement in Puttaswamy of which one is a greater public purpose, the databasing of DNA used in civil cases does not fulfill this criteria. Further, even within criminal cases, there is need to limit the collection of DNA to the investigation and prosecution of cognizable crimes to ensure the data in the DNA database is minimal and controlled.

The submission details a plethora of other concerns ranging from lack of privacy safeguards such as no informed consent, storage and sharing of information and the power of the DNA profiling board.

We are grateful that the Committee has invited non-official witnesses/experts to provide their views on November 27 and hope that both written and oral submissions that come their way will be taken into strong consideration, resulting in the suggestion of a much required revising of the Bill.

Science/Technology,[PSA] A Guide to Jobs in the field of Computer Science for Engineering Students in pre-final / final year,290,bggn06,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bggn06/psa_a_guide_to_jobs_in_the_field_of_computer/,52,"  

**Statutory Warning: I work with a lot of students in the final and pre-final year of engineering and all of the interview experiences I’ve gathered is from their personal experience. While making this thread, I have consulted multiple people who work for product based, service based and start-up companies to know about their work experience and pay scale. I’ve also used LinkedIn salary and Glassdoor Salary / reviews to support my words. I am willing to modify anything if you think it is wrong!**

I see a lot of threads every week asking about the job scene in India and how to get in. I will try to put everything I know in this post. 

**Companies** 

I classify companies into 3 types

1. Product Based
2. Service Based
3. Startups

# Product Based Companies

**What are they?**

These are companies that make their own products and sell software or integration or both. Most of the “apps” that you see are examples of product based companies. Generally, it is believed that a product based company is what an engineer should aim to get into because you will be working on making a product than using the product in most cases. You will be directly involved in developing or testing a product that your company made and the chances to be exposed to the best technologies is greater

**What do they need?**

Usually in a product based firm, the training is on the job. Nobody is going to hold your hand and tell you what to do. The training will be a bunch of online videos or MOOC or just documentation(s) that you are supposed to read and figure out what you have to do. Since the job profile is going to be like this, they expect someone who can code. You should have a strong hold in at least one programming language and some companies also demand good Object-Oriented Programming skills.

**Selection Process**

Most of the good companies hire from campuses of good colleges. There will be an online platform (like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) where you are given 2 to 3 questions. The first question is going to be an easy question to test if you can write code. The 2nd and 3rd question will aim to test your CS concepts mainly Algorithms. The 2nd question will be of medium difficulty and will usually have a brute force way to solve and an optimized way. Coding a brute force method will get you half the marks as the complex test cases will timeout. The 3rd question is usually meant to test your knowledge of implementing algorithms and problem-solving skills.

Some companies (like Uber, CodeNation, etc) hire from platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) and do not really look at what college you come from. But there is always a clause of minimum 60% academic score in most of the product based companies. Some companies take this a stretch further and even have a cut-off on 10th and 12th marks.

Linkedin jobs and Glassdoor jobs are also a good place to look out, but the response from these portals are a little slow in India!

**Interview Experience**

Once you clear the coding round, you will be shortlisted for an interview. In an interview, you will be given a problem. The problem can be a CS problem (algorithms and Data Structures) or a design problem. You are given time to think about it and they don’t usually expect you to code out a solution on the computer. You can write pseudo code and you can and MUST always share your thinking.

Some interviewers are going to give you a vague question and expect you to ask questions for more clarity. No question is a stupid question. Each interview lasts anywhere between 10 minutes to 40 minutes. Nobody is expecting a complete, correct and verifiable solution, but you cannot give totally wrong solutions.

You might be additionally quizzed on your resume. They might ask you in-depth questions about every project you have written there and ask you to justify the need for that project, why you chose the technologies, what did you learn, what were the difficulties you faced, etc. Sometimes, they might even ask you some questions related to the technologies you have mentioned on your resume.

You might have anywhere between 1 to 6 such rounds after which you will have a HR round.

Some companies use these rounds to filter candidates (i.e. only a certain number of candidates go from one round to the other) and the other companies give you a score every round and decide at the end. So, stay calm and don’t be overconfident just because you’re clearing rounds.

**How do I prepare for this?**

If you’re in college, focus in class. Subjects like Algorithms and Data Structures are qualifiers to get an interview. Once inside, you will be quizzed on Algorithms (80-85%) and the remaining 15-20% you will be asked about DBMS & Computer Networks (depending on companies)

If you did not focus on these subjects, get onto platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) / [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)/ [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/) and start solving. If you can solve a significant chunk of questions here, start solving questions from [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)/ [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) / /r/dailyprogrammer. You can also take MIT's course on Design and Analysis of Algorithm [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/). Some of the favorite questions are about Dynamic Programming, Trees, Hashing and Graphs.

**Salary & Benefits**

You can’t put a cap on salary on a product based firm. You can get anywhere between 6LPA to 12LPA (or more) as a base salary. It depends on companies. Check GlassDoor for reviews, know what the company does and see if your interests align with the company’s interest. Have a look at their official websites, know about their products and research before you go attend an interview. 

# Service Based Companies

**What are they?**

They’re companies that use the products that are available in the market and provide a service to a client. Some service based companies have developed their own products also, but most of the money in such companies comes from providing a service to a customer. Ex : Cognizant, TCS, etc

**What do they need?**

These companies are looking for someone who can wear multiple hats. When you are interviewing (as a fresher) to a service based companies, you will likely be hired under an umbrella role of “Associate” or “Engineer”. You might get into development, testing or support. Support isn’t the kind where you have to work in a call center, but its not a primarily engineering job either. The pay is less but the role can be fun depending on how much you put into work. You will have a wide array of options to come up in your career and nobody will expect a lot from you. At least not like the product based companies! 

**Selection Process**

Call for interviews are usually through walk-in interviews or an aptitude test. You will have to search websites that carter to jobs for freshers. ([TimesJobs](https://www.timesjobs.com/), [FirstNaukri](https://www.firstnaukri.com/), etc). You should be looking for an open-for-all kind of test. TCS has their own annual hiring tests, so you will have to follow TCS to know the dates. Infosys does hiring through open-to-all aptitude tests. You can also find information on the Careers section of these companies. Some smaller companies offer walk-in interviews or are found in job fairs.

Tests like [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) also help you get interview calls. [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) tests you for basic arithmetic aptitude, English comprehension skills, logic and reasoning skills, etc. You get a score and you wait for companies to call you for interview after [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/). 

There are also “coaching” institutes that teach you basic programming and offer you a 100% job guarantee. Most of the time, these jobs are for service based companies. The coaching fees can be anywhere between 10k to 25k. 

**Do you research before you pay for any service, don’t take my word for it**

A good entry point here is reference. If you know someone working for the company, you can get a referral and get an interview. This is very much valid here and a great percentage of hiring happens through referrals also. Many service based companies leverage your attitude over your skills. Some exploit your desperation to get you in for a lower pay.

**Interview Experience**

There isn’t a standard practice for interviews in a service based company. It basically depends on your interviewer. I know people who were asked a lot of theory questions based on their field of engineering even though the company had nothing to do with that field. But I also know people who were just asked HR-round questions like “Why do you want to join this company?” and “How would you tackle X scenario?” 

So pray to your favorite God(s) and Goddess(es) before you go for an interview. Read up about interview experiences for the company on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/index.htm) and [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/interview-experiences/) to get a rough idea of the kind of questions they might ask. Don’t be nervous!

**How to prepare?**

Basic aptitude and sometimes basic coding is what these companies look for. Basic coding means you should be able to understand what for/while/if-else if-else constructs do and maybe write a code to sort an array. Refer [IndiaBix](https://indiabix.com) for aptitude and take a programming language tutorial on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com). (You’re better off with [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp) or [Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java), but if you find them difficult start with [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python). But, eventually, move to [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)/[Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java) any one). Aim at getting 3 or 4 stars on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)!

**Salary & Benefits**

Salary can be from the range of 3 lpa to 6lpa depending on your company and interview. There is a scope of coming up in the job, but there is also a scope of getting frustrated with the job. Your job MIGHT be something as simple as forwarding tickets or something complex like fixing code or managing a service fault. But, what will get you up in this field is your dedication to work and patience. It is easier to climb into management in a service based company than it is in a product based company. While it is easier, it isn’t necessarily faster. It’s a very slow process and will take some time. So, if you lack patience or if you are looking to do a specific field of work (like, development only), this job isn’t for you.

Its relatively relaxing and you are a fish in an ocean, so the expectation the upper management has from you isn’t very high! You’ve standard benefits like insurance, variable pay / bonus, cab facility, etc. But don’t expect to be pampered :P

# Startups

**What are they?**

These are usually very small, very new companies that are in the prototype stage. They’ve just got their service out in the market. They’re MOSTLY a product-based company. They’re new, they’re young, they’re not making a lot of money currently, but they promise something big in the future.

**What do they need?**

Young, talented people who work without a lot of hand-holding. It helps if you’ve worked on technologies that they are looking for. A lot of companies use open-source tech, so its not something you need to go to classes to be trained in. Obviously, you must be able to take a lot of responsibility and write good quality code as your mentor will not be looking at every line of your code.

You are given a lot of independence, but you have a lot of responsibility too!

**Selection process**

If a start-up is coming on-campus, then they’re going to go the product company way and kick in some [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) tests. There is no single way a start-up hires. Sometimes, you will be able to get in by just calling them up and asking for an internship or emailing the HR or contacting the HR on LinkedIn. In smaller companies, you can even get in touch with the founders via LinkedIn and ask for an opportunity.

A lot of the start-ups are on [AngelList](https://angel.co/) and that can be your starting point. I think it is right to add that not all start-ups are innovative. Some “start-ups” aren’t really centers of innovation, but are only for money making. Today, if you open a coaching class that will train students in technology, you can get away by calling it a start-up. So, do your research about the company. If it is a very new company and has very few people, that isn’t usually a great company to start off with, unless, you are really interested in working on the product they have.

You can also keep a look out of Internship Fairs. A lot of the HR teams attend such fairs to hire graduates / students.

**Interview Experience**

Your interview experience will mostly likely be similar to a product company interview but not as strict. There is a mixture of skill and attitude that is considered. But if you are a complete noob, don’t expect to be hired by a start-up as they can’t afford to train you fully. You need to have some experience in some field of CS. Be it data science, application development, web development or machine learning. This is to demonstrate your ability to learn independently.

**How to Prepare?**

Hands-on, Hands-on, Hands-on! Grab a field you are interested in, go about solving small problems. The problems you solve can be as small as writing a script to automatically book tickets for the latest Avengers movie or as complex as creating a robot that can extinguish fire autonomously. 

Get good or get out!

**Salary and Benefits**

The salary isn’t standard. It depends on how old the company is, how much funding they have and how many employees are there. So, you can’t put a range. It can be as low as a service based company pays, it can be higher than what a product based company pays.

The work environment will give you a lot of independence. The offices will be more employee-friendly, you will not have someone monitoring you like a watchman 24x7 and you will not have strict policies that you’ve to adhere too. Your manager and higher management will be more approachable if you ever need to discuss something.

But at the same time, there is responsibilities too. I am reiterating this because the kind of independence you get can be a bad thing if you are used to hand-holding. This is because hand-holding is done in every step of school and college in India, either by teachers, parents or peers! That might not necessarily be the case with start-ups.

I will be writing more on Skill development, freelancing, switching jobs, etc ! Stay tuned and let me know what you thought about this. :D",FanneyKhan," Good effort! Seems well researched. Nice guide. In addition to the mentioned things, product based companies ask puzzles and system design questions. Depending on the company you may be asked less about DS Algo and more about the domain in which they work. Like Adobe would ask you more about CPP and implementation of memory functions. Samsung deals more with graph questions.

Also, if you are from tier 1 college then product companies would also come for internship opportunities. The oncampus internship interviews are a little bit easy. I did a big mistakes of not studying properly in college. Now that I am graduating soon I have less than 60% and couldnt sit for placements 😞. I am willing to do whatever to  fix this problem. Please help me just guide me. Should I just join a startup or keep applying for companies ? Biggest problem is I have less then 60% 😞. The question I hate the most in interview is ""why did you choose this project / why did you choose these tools to make your project?"". Man i chose these because I wanted to! Just preference. Just focus on your skills and any good company will eventually hire you. Don't feel intimidated by the job description, if you feel like applying for that particular job go for it. Be interviewed as much as  possible you can as it will only increase your confidence. It's programmer's market out there, so market is in your favour, negotiate your salaries keeping that in mind. If you got through the interview successfully, get to know the company and their top tech Management. Ask them what's their culture like, what tools they use for communication etc. Give importance to culture and people than to salary, it will go a long way in work satisfaction and overall happiness. This is excellent. >**How to Prepare?**

>Hands-on, Hands-on, Hands-on! Grab a field you are interested in, go about solving small problems. The problems you solve can be as small as writing a script to automatically book tickets for the latest Avengers movie or as complex as creating a robot that can extinguish fire autonomously. 

Ok so this caught my eye. I'm from a college where competitive coding is preached left and right and I just can't bear it.

I've been doing mobile development for almost a year and I thoroughly enjoy it and I want to be really good at it. So my question is if I were to continue this without doing competitive programming , would I be an attractive candidate (provided by the time I graduate I have a good GitHub portfolio) to these product and startup companies? Should be a sub where posts like this are stickied. Real quality post OP. Thank you So I have many people ask me about how base salary differs from CTC and in hand. Since, I mostly do contract work, my knowledge in this aspect is a bit limited. Can you help explain that? Can a graduate with no work experience but some good projects by his side get a job at a startup ? Say for example if a company wants to hire a frontend engineer. Is work experience a fixed criteria ? I've even seen college dropouts getting jobs as frontend or fullstack devs. Thank you. *flying kiss* Do you have info about applying jobs in other countries? [deleted] Thanks a lot! Nice writeup OP. Great post OP. As someone who has worked in a startup, service companies and product companies in the field of computers over last 15 years, I can say that your post is pretty much on point. I was literally panicking about my future 5minutes ago. Thank you for providing a basic overview of what to expect it is really really helpful. As someone who is going to enter in final year this August, this post is a godsend. Till now I haven't done much except the college subjects.

I posted this question earlier in ""Weekly Coder Thread"" but didn't recieve any reply so I'm posting it again here.

Hi,
What would you guys recommend to someone who's in 6th Sem pursuing B.Tech CSE 

1. DS Algos, Competitive Programming & Quantitative Aptitude

2. Web or Mobile Development (React,Node,Django, React Native etc)

I don't have much time to focus on both points so I have to decide one.

Pls help

Angel.co is great for Startups but where can I find openings for big companies as only service based companies visits my college and mostly aren't even for software developer but some business management and shit. As someone about to complete one year as a data analyst in a reputable firm, opportunities look slim to none as my firm uses a niche software and every other company requires hands on expertise on Python and R. I have knowledge of Python and R and fairly good understanding of Computer Science but nowhere close to me contributing from day one. Can anyone help me out? There is no growth at my current job and I would love a more challenging environment where i learn and earn more than i currently do. What the average salary one can get for a IT service based jobs here, after graduating from a tier 1 college like the top 5 IITs. With low cgp (6-7) but excellent IT certificates (comptia+) and good internship experience. will it still be low as 3-6lpa? A real quality post. Appreciate it op.

Science/Technology,Seeking advice on Warangal and an educational institution,17,crlp0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/crlp0t/seeking_advice_on_warangal_and_an_educational/,12,"A coworker from Sudan told me her younger brother got admission for [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) (Civil Engg.) in *Chaitanya Institute of Technology* and Science, Warangal. She wanted to get more information.

* It looks like *Chaitanya Institute of Technology* and Science was recently established (2010) and is not ranked in any listing. Any insights?
* How safe is Warangal for someone from African continent. I have seen posts about violence against Africans on this sub-reddit.
* What are the possibilities for him to transfer to a better educational institution after he starts in one educational institution?

She will be supporting him financially from her meagre income working as a barista at our cafeteria; so practical advice would be greatly appreciated by her. Thank you.",nirjhari," It's not ranked because it's just one among many other private universities in the country. I'm not aware of how much tuition fee they're charging but, if it's comparable to other well regarded private universities in the state, I'd suggest him to try for those. There's National Institute of Technology in Warangal, which is very well known and there you could find few students coming in from African nations and other foreign countries as well, probably to spend a semester or two there.

If you don't mind me asking, how did he come to know about that institution? He could've probably applied for universities in Hyderabad or any other metro city or even second tier city like Vijayawada, which isn't that far from Warangal. Cities are much safer because you can find someone from your own country(or neighborhood nations) there, studying in some other university. Better try for universities in Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad or any other tier two city in the south.


There are many private universities which do have good facilities and offer quality education, but be careful while choosing. There are probably like only 10% good ones, from among them all. SRM, GITAM are two private universities that I know of in my region. There are probably many such in metro cities but I don't know about any of them right now. Also, he could try applying for public universities, but then it's not gonna be easy. I'm not sure of his aptitude and STEM subject skills so I can't really suggest any public ones. But be sure to check them.


Violence against people of African origin does happen, but if he stays in the metro region and avoids traveling alone to remote areas in the country, he's safe and good. Also, it's better to get connected with students who  came from your country, as they'd be very able to guide you in a better way. I could only help you in suggesting whether the university that you opted for is regionally well known or not, but culturally adjusting is far more important. It'd help if someone you know is in or around that area.


Feel free to ask questions regarding universities or anything else. Hopefully, I can answer them as well. I used to live in Warangal. Many African students studied in NITW. I know of none who studied elsewhere. It was an okay experience for them.

Interestingly, I took an auto one day and an African guy was riding along. The auto driver tried to rip him off but the guy was having none of it. My guess is that these auto drivers try to rip them off any given chance. Other than that I think it was pretty okay for them. There is that subtle racism though, like impulsive mistrust. There's a very tiny African community. If he can get in contact with them, they can advise him on safety and stuff.

CIT is not a college for a foreign national to pursue education in. If the degree has value in Sudan then I guess it's okay but other than it, it's not of much use.

I'm not sure about the possibilities of transfer. He has to discuss that with the institute. Instead of seeking advice about the educational institutions, you should be seeking advice about whether this fellow should be [coming to India at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiN0SZPXlAk). Umm. I've never heard of this college - there are simply too many engineering colleges in Telangana.

I worked in Vijayawada for a few months and came across plenty of African students, so African students in tier-II cities of AP/TG is probably nothing new and would be safe I'm guessing.",2019-08-17 20:44:44
Science/Technology,Why is learning programming the de facto advice in this sub?,150,biwylz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/biwylz/why_is_learning_programming_the_de_facto_advice/,57,"Hi everyone! I am curious about the ground reality of people saying ""learn coding"" to get a job.

In this sub whenever I see a post that is made by a teenager struggling to find a job, be it people who already graduated, seniors in college or even freaking 12th grade students who couldn't get into prestigious colleges, people always seem to suggest them to try their hands on programming.

I feel this advice is misguided for anyone except college seniors. Working in the software industry requires you to have formal knowledge about the underpinning of various technologies. And this can only be acquired by going through a formal curriculum. Seniors from other majors can pick up on this quickly as most of them have had an introductory class on computer science in their freshman year and have batchmates who are computer science majors. I have seen many non computer science majors being placed in reputed companies by ""learning coding"" in their senior year.

But when we talk about the ones who have already graduated, it becomes tremendously hard to gather resources and devote time to go through those courses. Even if someone does do that, I can't seem to understand on why a recruiter might trust you on your skills. Having a degree and internships is what leads you to a company. I think unpaid internships would be a starter for this section of job seekers. But it would be a long term payout to get a paid job and I think one can definitely do a better job to get immediate returns rather than focusing on programming.

Finally, what made me write this post today is people suggesting it to someone who couldn't score well in JEE MAINS. Most probably the OP for that post hasn't had any prior introduction to programming. Doesn't this tantamount to society's misguided opinion of engineering/medical being the only path to success. Heck, we narrowed it down to programming on this sub. I do realise it is just a suggestion, but I feel this restricts him from exploring his own interests. Not scoring well in entrance exams could be a red herring that he is on the wrong path. Maybe that is what needs amends.

I would love to stand corrected on my views. Please share your opinions on why we collectively do so.

Thanks!",WhereIsLifeTakingMe2," [removed] I agree with you. There is life beyond, programming or JEE. Those one figured out way to deal with it, won't be asking questions here about options they have. We should engage more and give better solutions to young ones who are looking for the channels, avenues. 

One can become small town journalist, write stories, start printing wedding cards, electrician, plumbing, any kind of service sector with good level of social media reach Because that's what the majority of the sub's users are. They're all from an IT background. Their defacto advice is always that. randias advise : if you want to do something in free time , learn programming. If you have depression, hit the gym and delete Facebook. Also you shouldn't study engineering. Weird this post didn't get the traction. I need an answer too! Programming today is cool/looked upon like how speaking fluent or semi fluent English in 90's India was, it is a good touch to your portfolio. For majority of the non-cs and it branches core jobs related to their field are almost none. They pretty much end up in those mass it companies like tcs, so yeah that's why it is advised to learn programming as there is a high chance that you are going to end up on that path.

About other streams I don't really know. What other streams would you suggest? Hey, I think I am the one you are talking about. You can check my post history for verifying. 

I was specifically looking for coding advice because I love coding. I have completed python course from thenewboston, I know how use GitHub, I have account on stack overflow to clear my doubts and I am still doing a CS50 course whose sole purpose is to introduce students to computer science. I've written all this on post too. So, I am not sure you are specifically talking about me or not but if it's me, then I was looking for that advice, no one actually gave unsolicited coding advice to me Programming is high leverage. It's easy to learn. Most of the knowledge you need is found online.

I work in tech, and I've got no formal qualification other than 12th grade (I'm on a gap year after school). I'm also a part of an indie maker community, where it's fairly common to meet 16y/o kids who are self taught in almost every way bootstrapping startups, making good money. (Of course, software isn't the only pathway to this world and neither is it the only skill you need, but it's a good choice due to the high leverage it provides)

&#x200B;

>Working in the software industry requires you to have formal knowledge about the underpinning of various technologies. And this can only be acquired by going through a formal curriculum.

&#x200B;

Could you give me an example of such formal knowledge? I suspect someone who's motivated enough can pick up just about anything. Software happens to be a field without certain barriers to entry, like government certification which only graduates can apply for.

&#x200B;

>Having a degree and internships is what leads you to a company

It's one metric, but not the only. Ultimately, employers want someone who's performant at a task, and can be responsible for it. Degrees prove your knowledge and intelligence, but these can be good replacements when you don't have one:

* have awesome side projects that demonstrate ability
* write good articles or record podcasts which prove your depth of knowledge
* communicate your existing skills well
* learn to spot opportunities early (ex: reach out to founders working on cool startups that aren't widely known yet)

&#x200B;

That's a non-exhaustive list. And of course, you can have those alongside a degree. I share this opinion too. Everyone seems to give similar advice and I can't understand why! What? I thought selling door knobs we the default advice here!

/s Because it is a relatively easy skill to learn and has very high leverage and demand in the job market currently. I graduated jobless with a GPA of less than 5. Teaching myself programming was the easiest way out for me. Five years after my graduation, I was earning the famous 1.6lpm. Now, no one cares about my GPA or that I wasn't a IT grad. Only getting the first job was difficult. Programming provided an easy way out for me.

Obviously, mileage will vary for different people. I got lucky and was able to learn it easily enough. However, it should be no surprise that it is the most common suggestion. Another point to note is that programming is now used in nearly all industries, so you can supplement it after a few years with an MBA and try to do a career change.

Even now, if I see a jobless graduate who did Mechanical or Chemical or any other core fields, I'll suggest he/she try to get into programming unless they are really passionate about something else. Trust me, there's a real demand for **good** programmers. Am guessing , vast majority of this sub is engineers and therefore suggest what they know. I believe that programming will soon become a skill that everyone should possess, it will become normal, even in the non tech careers. In the coming years programming will become as common or necessary as speaking English was, or it will become the new standard for computer fluency. You don't need to know how to write immaculate code, but maybe knowledge of basic programming, algorithms and knowing how to read code will be required in the coming decades. I'm in Commerce and I have basic to super amateur  knowledge of javascript and python but mostly algorithms. It's where I can pick up coding in a few months without wasting time on learning super simple stuff and even beginner things. Programming as a tool is becoming relevant in many jobs. An accountant benefits by using basic functions in Excel to accomplish  complex tasks; a doctor can use Python to parse data from text and check for patterns;a civil engineer can customize the tool s/he uses by building modules for simulation;a hobbyist can try to program the problems like the numbers round of 8 out of 10 cats does countdown.... Bias :)

Guilty as charged. Because its the easiest way to learn a skill and start making money. A good, self taught developer can work and earn good money as a freelancer where degrees do not matter. Most of the advice related threads are about desperate people looking for a quick way out of their problems, hence it is the most obvious solution.

That being said, its not for everyone.

Log to ab free ki advice ke baare mai complain karne lage. 

/r/ChoosingBeggars I guess most people on this sub are coders who don't know the world outside coding.   
Don't get me wrong, it is a great skill to have. I am a coder, too but now I am trying to become a comedian. If you learn programming, you can build a solid career as a freelancer while getting paid in $

You can do the same with any other in-demand skill like marketing or content writing, but the path isn't as obvious with those, and you have to be really good to stand out agains the trash that litters freelancing sites for those talents Knowing coding without any formal education about finite automata theory, programming languages , compilers, os, data structures, algorithms and computer architecture is like blindly walking in the darkness. It would take you up till certain distance but eventually you will fall flat. 

So suggesting a teenager to code who's already under pressure for the whole year for entrance exam sounds daft to me. He needs to gather his shit , get into a decent engg college for education of computer science , get into those coding competition s and hackathons, spend time on hacker ranks and what not. And finally look for opportunities to do open source projects. And then perhaps get a master's degree to get more exposure while continuously working on his coding skills , getting a girlfriend or boyfriend , living a little and developing a hobby of reading good technical and non technical books.

This again is my personal opinion.

As far as working professionals are concerned,last time I checked , there were many nano degree offerings on the online education platforms. One can use them too. If this is related to my post then I do have prior coding knowledge(c++ and java) and i did get viteee slot 2 on the second day of counselling but i don't think i'll go cuz its not worth it and jee was shit(got 170) and i knew that but i was shocked to see people who scored 200+ to get 18k rank.I've decided to leave reddit and I've stopped using insta cuz bits is my only hope and i'm scoring around 330 in my mock tests.

https://preview.redd.it/vk8zcbb4sio31.jpg?width=389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b81169a3f60ecc89d246db99901cf18b1024cabb

**24 September 2019:** In today's hearing before the Supreme Court in Facebook's transfer petition seeking transfer of *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* from the Madras High Court to the Supreme Court, extensive arguments were made by the parties on whether technical and complex issues involving encryption should be addressed by the judiciary.

On 23.09.2019, IFF filed its response to Facebook's transfer petition and reiterated that while it believes such problems should be addressed by the legislative and executive branches of government, the Supreme Court should not curtail the jurisdiction of High Courts to entertain writ petitions by ordinary Indian internet users against large multinational tech companies. Ordinary Indian internet users residing in different parts of the country should be allowed to approach their State High Courts if their fundamental rights are violated by Big Tech because most Indians do not have the resources to initiate litigation in the Supreme Court. While we believe that the prayers in *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* are misguided and strongly oppose any attempts to weaken encryption, it is also important to preserve access to justice for aggrieved citizens.

During today's hearing, the bench once again inquired about the status of the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules which have been in the pipeline since December 2018. The Counsel for the Central Government clarified that the policy formulation process was underway and ""special suggestions"" were being sought to revise the Rules. However, he stated that a specific timeline for notification of the Rules could not be provided. The Bench comprising of Deepak Gupta J. and Aniruddha Bose J. noted that while misuse of technology is a serious concern, such technical and complex issues are best addressed by the executive branch.

The Counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu insisted that WhatsApp was trying to avoid complying with Indian law by stating that it does not have the technology to identify the originator of information on its platform but this was not true since Dr. Kamakoti who is a Professor at IIT Madras had provided a technical solution to enable tracing of originator. In response, Senior Advocate Mr. Kapil Sibal appearing for WhatsApp stated that another IIT Professor had disagreed with Dr. Kamakoti's proposed solution. This was a reference to the expert report by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran from IIT Bombay that IFF had previously filed before the Madras High Court. Read more about it [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-files-independent-expert-submission-before-madras-hc/).

After hearing these submissions, the Court noted that such complex issues need to be decided in consultation with technical experts and the judiciary cannot be expected to implement such changes. The Court emphasized that while policy formulation was within the domain of the executive, any policy formulated by the government is subject to judicial scrutiny to ensure that it does not undermine the right to privacy. Since the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules are being actively considered by the Government, the Court adjourned the matter till 22.10.2019. It further directed the Solicitor General to file an affidavit by the Secretary of MeitY within 3 weeks about the status of the Rules and provide a definite timeline about when the process will be completed.

IFF's Executive Director, Mr. Apar Gupta said the following about IFF's stance in today's hearing:

>""IFF represents Indian internet users and their fundamental rights, and not Big Tech. This requires us to take principled positions on what’s the best outcome possible in tough and complex situations.  
Ordinary internet users should have the ability to approach local judicial forums against Big Tech and will lack the financial capacity and resources to travel from remote places in India to judicial forums such as the Supreme Court of India at New Delhi.  This is separate from our substantive position which we have explained and our stance has been taken after considerable deliberation and inputs from our external team of lawyers.  
Just like we have filed a technical submission opposing traceability in the Hon'ble Madras High Court, we also opposed the transfer petition after receiving legal advice. According to us, it is best to contest the demand for traceability or social media regulations before the Hon'ble High Court. The High Court judgement will of course be subject to appeal if parties are aggrieved and the transfer petition is dismissed.    
Ultimately foregrounding all of this is our defense of the standards of the Shreya Singhal judgement. This is why we recommend that such complex questions that rest on technical aspects of computer science should be settled by executive and legislative processes rather than through courts. Any such legislative changes or regulations are also similarly open to judicial challenge if they undermine fundamental rights.""

The next hearing in the transfer petition is on 22 October 2019 and we will keep you updated about how this important case progresses. IFF was represented in today's hearing by Udayaditya Banerjee, Ria Singh Sawhney and S. Prasanna, and we are extremely grateful for their continued support.

As per media reports which surfaced yesterday the Rajkot Police Department has arrested 7 youths for playing the PUBG online video game. Clearly things have spiralled out of control.

## A contested public debate

PUBG entered the mainstream lexicon in which the Hon'ble Prime Minister on January 29, 2019 while interacting with the concerns of a parent referred to it jovially. He clearly indicated in his remarks that, ""[*technology is a problem -- as well as a solution*](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/yeh-pubg-waala-hai-kya-pm-modi-aware-of-pubg-and-fortnite-addiction-offers-tips-on-how-to-deal-with-it-1442411-2019-01-30)"" and suggested patience and guidance as an approach for encouraging children to use their time productively. Alongside these remarks advisories were being issued by Child and Adolescent welfare bodies in some states including [Delhi](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/top-story/is-pubg-a-menace-delhi-child-rights-panel-says-game-negatively-impacts-kids/story/317245.html) and [Gujarat](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/pubg-addiction-gujarat-government-issues-notice-to-ban-students-from-playing-pubg-or-any-other-addictive-game/352324) that the game was addictive and could cause negative impacts on children even beyond their academic performance.

It is important to take a step back this moment and consider the wider academic literature on the subject. The top three cited meta studies on Google Scholar on the general impact of gaming on adolescents indicate varying outcomes. Some even suggest benefits such as development and improvement of hand eye co-ordination (*remember the old Atari's?*).

https://preview.redd.it/nfpahf4632m21.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ffc8afca6b06ee2d8eae6a26267b616a03d157a

Yes, we may be completely wrong in an our inferences, but believe that this may be a matter for parental caution, and social debate but certainly not penal law. We explain the dangerous consequences of approaching this as a legal issue below.

## Prohibitory Order on playing PUBG

The Rajkot Police Commissioner has issued a prohibitory order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on March 6, 2019. A Section 144 order under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 is usually made to prevent illegal physical assemblies a breach of peace. While large numbers of online gamers do congregate and spend long hours in front of their smartphones or gaming consoles much to the annoyance of their friends and family such assemblies are rarely unlawful. It would be a stretch to call such activities as threatening public order.

Hence, we were surprised when a Kumar Manish posted this tweet:

We have today been able to have a [rough translation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16xDu9OqcEmEq8fRupJmcORiJv0wfpVvR/view?usp=sharing) prepared in English thanks to the help offered by Manan Bhatt.

From reading the prohibitory order, it is reasonable to infer that as per press reports, 7 youths ranging from the ages of 19 to 26 have been arrested for the breach of this prohibitory order. At this point we found ourselves bewildered and taken aback as this is seemingly a grave attack on personal liberty. We believe as the Hon'ble Prime Minister noted in his conversation that concerns on online gaming are better handled with the care and affection of a parent and teachers. Certainly not by creating fear of penal law, through prohibitory orders issued by the police and subsequent arrests. This is not only abhorrent to sensibility but offends our core fundamental rights as it lacks rationality and the reasonableness necessary in any restriction imposed by the State.

In the coming days we will be sourcing and authenticating information and taking steps including talking to a legal team based out of Gujarat. We hope to address this issue responsibly and meanwhile urge the Gujarat government to look into this matter urgently. We appeal to them -- *jailing people should not be a game*.

On the contrary all this is gonna do is create a fuck load of anger inside people towards the entire Indian system and infact set a really shitty example of violation of human rights. If we keep going the same way all its gonna do is pretty much add up to the god damn negative-perception people have about india. About how india is a closed minded and non-progressive country still stuck in the old ages. Lmao i wouldnt be surprised if i saw a ban on gaming consoles or smartphones one of the days. It really sucks lmao. Anyways you ain’t stopping none. The people who want to access porn sites are still gonna access em. The people who wanna access reddit WILL ACCESS reddit.  Par ModiJi ne toh PubJi par joke mara tha... aur log ulluyon ki tarah hase bhi the If you dont want your child to play pubg, just take their phone away. No one elee is messing with your kid, only you're responsible. Don't blame others for your kid's fault, parents. Forget Russian scientists who had to use quantum computers to reverse time. We fucking managed to go back in time without them.  They should ban TV/Movies as well since they’re highly addictive as a medium too and not to forget filled with violence. I seriously don’t get this mentality, games are a form of entertainment just as Movies and Shows are, then why are they specifically targeting us gamers with the sudden popularity of PUBG. It’s not like we didn’t have COD or Counter Strike before.  Matlab bade bade criminal rape karke aur desh ke paise loot ke bhaag rahe hai idhar udhar lekin mai kya karega?? Mai jake PUBG khelne wale ko jail me dalega, because fuck democracy that's why! /s Censorship all over. Arresting for games. Blocking reddit. What are we upto? It's not far away that we will have access to only a few sites/apps that support the ruling party agendas.  Back then, we had PC games where we rode bikes & kicked cops, consumed mushrooms & killed turtles, drove cars & simply ran over pedestrians. Wonder how any of these would have survived in today's times. Maybe if they release a patch with ""WINNER WINNER, GOUMUTRA DINNER"" slogan, this shit won't happen. I wish India focused on it's development rather than less important matters like Mandir and banning apps and changing names of places. People will be jailed for playing games but the real culprit will go abroad. Jai Hind.  PUBG user should show power of game and start playing in real life by starting “fill the jail” movement. 

Once police and court become so overwhelmed by all these paperwork than they realise what they are asking for.  These idiotas will make any and every incomprehensible and idiotic law as long as it meets the demand of their Vote Bank!! 
What a waste of life! There were cases of murder and theft reported on account of this video game. The police just took the ""easy way out"" to s*olve* the problem. There should be a better way of educating the people about the ill effects of playing this game, instead of a blanket ban IMO. ",2019-03-14 17:47:01

Science/Technology,[Rant] I'm seriously tired of this is so called education,12,ctzkd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ctzkd1/rant_im_seriously_tired_of_this_is_so_called/,6,"This is mostly your weekly education rant, nothing new. Throwaway account since I'd like to stay anonymous and wanted to let my thoughts out in the open.

A bit about me first. I loved computers from a pretty young age but at the time I simply loved it as a hobby. I also remember the young me reading tons of books on topics like space and nature. The only thing I was good at my middle school was Physics and Computer Science but kinda ignored all the other subjects. I also loved helping other students with these subjects to the extent teachers would point out to me with ""stop being so noisy"" and ""get back to your seat"" kind of synonyms. I was pretty open to the future wondering what it held for me. Anyway, I decided to pick up Engineering.

Everything has been going in a downward spiral since then. As any typical kid in India trying to get into a good Engineering college, I went to these so called JEE coaching classes. These places were so horrible. Over time, I realised that these coaching classes are simply forcing down material onto their students. If there was some actual learning happening in there, given the vast syllabus, it wouldn't be so surprising whenever a high school kid from India marked an innovation in science. Rather we see students killing themselves for not being able to score good marks in the examination. There is such an intense pressure on kids since you're constantly being told that not making into a good college equates to no woman marrying you and you're going to be working an awful job, if not jobless. In short, your life is going to become so fucked up that we see kids already making peace with death instead. And then out there are some fucking assholes who feel that this is helping in reducing the population of our country by weeding out the unworthy. Just stop making kids at the rate you shit, fuckheads. Instead of making a positive effect in the country, these coaching centres asking for a shitload of money are simply saturating the already saturated field of Engineering in India. Some parents also force their kids to these coaching centres just because of their faculty flaunting their achievements as if they are a God's gift to this world. Anyway, these coaching centres are just a symptom of the core problem of how most reputed colleges in India accept students solely on the basis of one or two examinations and how colleges like to be seduced into being an AICTE approved college. This whole education thing has turned into fucking business.

I failed my JEE since I couldn't keep up. The failure doesn't hurt me, partially because it is my way of rejecting this system. I've come to a realisation that I cannot learn things solely by books and paper, I need to experience it in reality, or I cannot digest anything. Which is why I was probably good in and loved Physics and Computer Science. It costs virtually nothing to see things in motion and see that the equations really do match up, and write computer programs to do stuff for you and everything makes sense. The thing is that doing everything in such a way consumes a lot of time, but I feel it is worth it. It's extremely hard to work on all the high school concepts here and look out for their real world significance at the same time, all when the examinations are pretty much all formulae and rote based.

Anyway, I joined a tier-3 college hoping to at least make it nice in Computer Science since all you need is a Computer to experience anything. But oh lord fuck this place. Just so you know, I spent my high school years learning to program by writing small scripts to manipulate my environment and eventually, I started working with other people to make open-source software. So all this helped me get into GSoC in my very first year of college and worked with some genuine people working hard to make a positive impact to this world. If not for GSoC, I'd also have been forced to attend the ""summer training"" to ""learn HTML & CSS"" along with other students in the college itself, where the students are kept idle for like half the session and you know what all restrictions they put on even when you are idle - no phones, no YouTube, no heads down for taking a break, no talking to other students (seriously?!). I had another friend of mine who did GSoC in the 2nd year but you know what, students were supposed to ""attend a training institute"" by paying the institute money during this summer break but apparently his GSoC wasn't considered since it was seen as an online course (as opposed to going and attending a training institute) by our Head of Department. So, rejected. Poor guy still had to pay a private institute for his forged training certificate despite of working so hard and lie that he worked on both his training and his GSoC project.

I'll talk about some more wonders here. Our college has so called Soft Skills sessions where instead of learning how to communicate properly with other people, you are simply taught how to flaunt and bluff every little thing to everyone and speak hollow words to ""impress"" other people (since in the end, this college only cares about to headline the highest number of placements offered in the Limca Book of Records). Rather than receiving proper technical knowledge, we spend time practising aptitude questions. Many students here have difficulty communicating, structuring grammar and forming sentences in simple English due to their unfortunate backgrounds and yet no work is ever done to help those students become proficient. It's been 3 semesters since we've been studying about Software Engineering and Software Testing to learn the craft of creating and maintain a software, and literally not a single fucking line of code yet! Most students still believe all that there is to testing a software is looking for bugs by hand. There hasn't even been a mention of automated tests and sort till date and I am 3 years in. And, if the authorities find any students good in solving aptitude questions, they are going to differentiate them by making them solve CodeChef problems in extra classes as if remaining students are merely a possession to the college for the time.

We are assigned to work on a team project every semester and are evaluated by professors who have no experience in the said technology the project is based on. These professors then end up judging students by asking standardised definitions from the desired technology in the final viva instead of actually evaluating by asking project specific questions. No wonder the majority of students steal from GitHub or copy-paste projects from their peers, no one cares. Also, the assignment questions are so blunt with hardly any thinking involved, you can look them up and boom you get full marks if you submitted it on time. Now, I could keep listing whatever the hell is wrong here: Minimum attendance: 75% or no exams for you. Students are forced to stay seated and their heads up even if the concerned subject teacher is on leave and the substitute teacher has nothing to teach about. Internet/WiFi is censored by some company called FortiGuard, anyway the Internet hardly works here. Can't eat, roam or leave the campus before 12 noon. Worst of all, there are students who have been so brainwashed that they blindly trust the authorities just because they believe the faculty is truly full of professionals and are the ones who can help them get a job if they keep repeating their words. We aren't really learning anything here of actual use.

I don't even know whether this is the situation for most colleges in India or I just happen to be in one.

Now here is me who helps with some really nice open-source projects, writes technical posts trying my best not to repeat what the Internet already knows, fighting censorship, trying to help my peers and random internet people with anything technical whenever possible, just because I like to care about people.  All this when college eats up my 9+ hours (including commute) everyday, I really feel like a fucking idiot now. What am I even doing. I don't even want to bother with money or be a rich man, just enough to feed myself or if a family happens someday. This shit has been so sickening lately that I've started doubting that it's just me who the real asshole here is.",throwaway93681," Oh man. My story is like 99% similar to yours. At least you had some group projects and stuff, all I had to go through was countless hours of theory just to pass the exams from the professor who didn’t knew shit what they were even talking about.

I just didn’t give a shit anymore, stopped eating properly stopped going out, stop exercising. Started to loose interest in everything I did even the things I used to like, programming. No wonder I dropped out of engineering. I agree dude, the whole system is ass here. I went abroad for all my education even after I cracked JEE because I knew I would be able to actually grow as a person out there. College should help people mature and grow instead of just forcing an education. They don’t treat you like an adult or give you any freedoms here. I remember my first day in a dorm and I asked the RAs if there are any restrictions on what time I can be out and they were like you can go out wherever you want. If you go talk to an advisor about your interest or careers they genuinely talk about it and help you find classes, clubs, minors or even help switch your major. They treat you like an adult and let you make your own choices everywhere else. Over here it’s all about cramming information into you and getting you a shitty job. Hi Mate,
I pretty much agree with most of what you said. Although I can't help you much but I can certainly offer you some advice about Gsoc and getting a coding job on your own.Life is really long and  If you really love coding there is very little that can stop from getting a great job after you are free from the university..

Ping me if you want some advice Are you from SRM by any chance? https://youtu.be/XQ0CG-HlvD0 A very honest rant, frankly after seeing the inefficient working of colleges, it's better to enroll with a distance learning course which provides a legit degree like IGNOU. A lot cheaper, saves a lot of time for learning and you are getting your degree anyway which makes everyone eligible to sit in whatever they want.",2019-08-23 00:09:58
Science/Technology,[Guide] Building your resume while in college as a CS Engineering student [Part 1 / 4],34,c87jbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c87jbg/guide_building_your_resume_while_in_college_as_a/,13,"This is a guide that I wanted to write since a long time and I was inspired by a post written about college placements on this forum. The end goal of this guide would be to land you a job at a product based company. The pre-requisites are that you should not hate coding and you need to know a programming language / at least have the determination to learn.

I will be constructing this guide as a whole for the 4 years that you will be in engineering. Feel free to skip some or add anything extra if you feel the need to. I've been writing drafts for this post since a week and have tried to organize my thoughts, but excuse any disorganization :)

This guide might help you if you check these boxes:

* A computer science student (preferably a newbie)
* Still in college (preferably in 1st year)
* Have a zeal to excel in the field and get relevant jobs.
* Have a blank resume with respect to your engineering degree.

**Stage 0 : Pre-work**

If you are very new to college, the odds are you are either severely depressed because of the achievements of people around you or you are overly enthusiastic for a new beginning or you are just unaffected by college. All of those are okay. If you are in the basket where you are scared of people boasting off about their achievement in the first year of college, don't worry! It doesn't matter what others do as long as you do what you can do and a lot of people who boast do not possess the expertise they think they posses. However, if you feel out of place, do DM me. We can have a chat.

In the pre-work phase, one has to understand their college and how things work in their college. This is best done in first year, before your first summer vacation. Most of the colleges have cells or clubs that have some sort of active projects. You need to talk to people, go through the college website and find out about these clubs. These clubs can be student-run or it can be run by a group of professors. You should be looking at the latter as they have well defined problem statements that they'd be working on and you've better chances of getting good exposure working on these projects.

Make a list of all the clubs that are there. Know about the procedure to get into each of these clubs, the projects they are offering / have previously done and who is the contact point. From these clubs, pick any of the interesting clubs/projects and set a goal to work towards developing skills that would help in those projects.

A personal recommendation would be to avoid highly specific clubs i.e. if a club is focusing on one problem statement that it is trying to solve since a few years it might not be the ideal place for a newbie to join. Smaller problem statements are good.

At the end of this stage, you must have a goal to be a part of one (or multiple) clubs during your first summer break.

**Stage 1 : Year 1**

In the first year, you will be under a common branch and your subjects will be science-related and not field-related. You might have 1 subject each semester that relates to your field, but I am not sure how much of help that would be as the teachers would be teaching the subject to non-CS people too. However, they will be introductory programming classes and its good to focus during these classes. If you don't find them helpful, read on.

We will divide the 12 months of first year into 3 quarters. 

1. Spend the first three months into learning at least one programming language. 
2. In your second three months, you should be able to read code and implement a few things. Then, pickup a programming language like C++ / Java. 
3. In your third quarter, you should look at trying to test your learning by implementing something useful. It can be small, it can be something that's already there, but do try to implement it from scratch by yourself.

Let me elaborate all three stages clearly.  


**Stage 1.1 : First Quarter, First Year - Learning a programming language**  
Python is an easy programming language to start off. You can also start off with C/C++/Java if you really want to skip a few steps, but I would ideally suggest you start off with Python. Learning resources like Hackerrank Language course, Automate The Boring Stuff e-book, some long Youtube tutorials and Learn Python The Hard Way ebook should be of help.  
Note : You should not aim to finish all 4 sources as that is not practically possible in three months. Follow a breadth first learning approach where you read a little and write a little. 

A good step to start off would be to aim to get 4 stars on Hackerrank's Python course to get a good grasp of the syntax. You should be familiar with indentation, for loops, if-else ladders, functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries and optionally, list comprehension. During your course, if you feel like something isn't clearly explained in Hackerrank, navigate to that section of Learn Python The Hard Way and refer it.

At this stage, you are comfortable with reading and writing Python, not explore Automate The Boring Stuff and try implementing some of the tasks given there. (I am looking at something that is onwards from chapter 8 of that book).

Alternatively, you can also watch and implement code from hour long Youtube tutorials that make promise to make you a hero from a zero in Python. But this looks like a hack that isn't rewarding because you are quite literally copy-typing the code that the Youtuber has written.

**Stage 1.2 : Second Quarter, First year - Implement & Learn OOP**

Many companies in the outside market look for Object Oriented Programming as a skill. After writing Python code, you are probably going to curse Java/C++ and will skip it completely because you won't believe how relevant these languages are in the market. This is one of the most common mistakes people do, but at the end they'd have to end up learning at least one of these languages. If you are taking up Java, I'd recommend [Derek Banas' Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19) on youtube. You'd be coding what he's coding, but if you understand your code that is good enough. Learn about data structures in java (List, Set, etc) and learn about Iterators, Object Oriented Design Principles (Inheritance, Interface, Extension, etc). If you are looking for something smaller, [try this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/). 

Similar courses exist for C++ also, so do your homework.

**Stage 1.3 : Third Quarter, First Year - Build something small**

So, now you know Python and to some extent Java. You've two paths from here. One is build something using Python/Java or second, learn HTML + CSS + JavaScript and build something with that. It can be something as small as a script receiving some data from an API and putting it in an excel sheet, or a calculator. The idea of this experiment is to check how fast you can build things. Once it is suitably built, you will have to write test cases. If you think it is too early to write test cases, list test cases on an Excel/Google Sheet and start testing your code for boundary cases.

For instance, if you have written a code that takes in a Reddit Thread as an input, gathers all the comments, checks the age of the accounts on all parent comments and returns some analytics (say, how many accounts are < 1 month old, less than 1 year old, etc) on it. You will need to handle test cases where your internet isn't working, the URL is wrong, you can't parse because your authentication token to Reddit API is wrong, the thread URL is wrong, etc. Basically, everything that you can think of.   


**FAQ**

> Should I get an internship in the first year?

Ideally, I wouldn't recommend an internship. Work with personal projects / college projects / skill development. Most of the internships given out to first year students are petty work that would be wasting time. Its much easier to put this in 2nd year when you will have a strong(er) resume.

> Should I specialize in one field?

No. Personally, a lot of students restrict themselves to learning only the buzzword fields, which is wrong. What is a buzzword today might have no relevance tomorrow. Focus on learning to learn, than learning one technology or one area. Initially, learn a little bit of a lot of things and slowly specialize into a field. That way, if your specialization does not click in the market, you always have a strong fundamental to pick something else up.

> Should I do problem solving?

Personally, I would say yes. But it is optional. I feel first year is too early to dive into algorithms and data structures even though a lot of colleges do teach basics of these. If you are really interested, you can definitely spend some time everyday in solving problems on Hackerrank / Leetcode / InterviewBit. But don't overdo it.

1 **What is Fall ArmyWorm?** - [Wiki link here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_armyworm)

Below quote is from [The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations ](http://www.fao.org/fall-armyworm/en/)

>The Fall Armyworm (FAW), or Spodoptera frugiperda, is an insect that is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. In the absence of natural control or good management, it can cause significant damage to crops. It prefers maize, but can feed on more than 80 additional species of crops, including rice, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, vegetable crops and cotton. **FAW was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016 and has quickly spread across virtually all of Sub-Saharan Africa. In July 2018 it was confirmed in India and Yemen**.

2 **DownToEarth.org has studied and covered the FAW effects in India** - [Article here](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/agriculture/fall-armyworm-attack-the-damage-done-63445)

(*DownToEarth is an fortnightly magazine, produced by an India based NGO Centre for Science and Environment*)

> * By the time the infestation was detected, it had already become malignant. Khemo Baghel, a farmer of Bade Chakwa village in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district, took up maize cultivation for the first time early this year. He dug a borewell and was convinced that the return from maize would be better than any other crop. But hardly had the seeds sprouted, he saw some keedas (worms) slowly colonising his farm. “I detected them one morning. There was no trace of them the previous day. I think they landed at night,” he narrates. Within two months, the keedas had a firm grip on his farm, taking away 30 per cent of his maize crop. 

> * Now agriculture scientists and extension officers frequent Bade Chakwa and neighbouring villages and they too are puzzled. But by now, the outlier has a local name: “American keeda”.

> * In Palari village, the American keeda has damaged the entire maize crop. “I have been farming for four to five years, but have never noticed this insect. **Pesticides are not effective on them**,” says Parmeshwar Pandey.

> * In just nine months since FAW was spotted in India in Karnataka last June, it has invaded crops in over 10 states. As if taking a pre-scripted route, FAW infestation has spread from Karnataka to all southern states; then to western Maharashtra and Gujarat; and now to eastern states

> * Besides advancing fast, the pest is also attacking new crops. Though it is being detected mostly in maize crops—a preliminary calculation estimates it has affected nearly 170,000 hectares (ha) of maize crops—there have been reports from states where it has infested paddy, sugarcane and sweet corn. 

> * **Maize is the third most important cereal crop in India after rice and wheat. It accounts for 9 per cent of the total food grain production in the country.**


> * In Andhra Pradesh’s Institute of Frontier Technology — an affiliate of the Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU) in Tirupati — crop researchers are a worried lot as the news of infestation has turned from a trickle to a deluge. It was first identified in Andhra Pradesh in August 2018 when it affected maize growing areas of East and West Godavari districts, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram. **“With maize seed production being a major crop in Godavari district, it can have serious economic consequences. Being a major ingredient for the poultry and cattle feed, production losses in maize could cripple meat and milk production**,” says M John Sudheer, principal scientist at ANGRAU.

Science/Technology,Confused with my career,7,d26lgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d26lgr/confused_with_my_career/,2,"Hi, I'm 23 year old man, living in India, I did my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science, I was fine in programming and was a noob in competitive programming, I somehow cracked the TCS CodeVita (a competitive programming competition) and got a job in TCS, but I'm not very much satisfied with my job. The college I studied in was tier three college so good companies don't visit our campus. I had offers from TCS, Wipro etc but TCS was the best in all the worst companies I had offers from so I joined it. The salary I get is also very low (3.5lpa), also I have a service agreement of an year there.

I'm very much confused about my future as to what I should do next, I don't want to work there. I need a good salary. So should I get better at competitive programming and let companies contact me or should I get decent in DS, Algos, give eLitmus and let companies contact me? Or should I give the GATE exam and do M.Tech or should i go to US and do my masters or should I give CAT and go for MBA.

Also my girlfriend is doing her master's from a well reputed college so I have an inferiority complex, she'll also be doing PhD. Me being a B.Tech feel very bad about myself. 

Someone please guide me. I'm already depressed.",BeatMall," Take Gate only if you are interested in studying. If you are looking for a better job, practice and appear for coding interviews. 

Never be discouraged by the achievements of your gf/spouse. They need your encouragement not jealousy.

Also, please don't be depressed. Most engineers start their career at tcs and the like. Build up from here. At worst you are on the same path as most engineering grads You need to pass 2-3 years in TCS. It will be difficult but doable. You need the experience number. Believe me, TCS experience holds good value in the market. Meanwhile, pick a technology that you like and learn it thoroughly in your personal time. TCS provides plenty of premium learning resources. Try to do 1-2 projects on that. Then start giving interviews on the tech that you learnt. TCS does not mention the platform you worked on in the company on their experience letter, so you can lie on your resume. You might have to give multiple interviews before you get selected but every setback helps to be better. Also interview everywhere even in companies that you have never heard of.

Also it is better to learn a technology where there are less people on that skill set available in the market. That is a great advantage as it is easier to get a good job with knowledge of say Big Data when compared to Java.

I started as mainframe developer in TCS after passing from a 3tier college. I was pushed into this garbage technology without providing any options. I now work at a multinational bank as a React developer and there are people passed out from IITs, NITs, BITS etc. who report to me.",2019-09-10 20:05:55

author is confused, maybe?

Abdul Kalam is known as a scientist coz he was one by his profession and designation, in both drdo and isro. One needn't be an academician and guide PhDs like Rao for being worthy of the title. It's the equivalent of saying that professional scientists of NASA or NCAR aren't real scientists as they are not Professors. Unlike the latter whose career depends upon impact factors and finding, career scientists have more security and a more focused domain. Creating a new satellite or any stuff doesn't mean that they are copy pasting or just scaling a design like lego builders; it involves applied science, hundreds or thousands developing new materials, better fuel options, better heat dissipation, structural design, aerodynamics, control systems and all sorta works. And unlike academicians of basic research they don't have the compulsion to publish for brownie points. Sometimes you are not exactly allowed to publish, even.

To the arguement of India lagging behind science, by research output we are at top 5; and research funding we at top 6. 

[India ranks 5th in global research publication output: report](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.livemint.com/Education/QYkn6doeciNSv2m7CzG7dP/India-ranks-5th-in-global-research-publication-output-repor.html%3Ffacet=amp&utm_source=googleamp&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=googleamp)

Need of the hour is technologists who can churn the basic science to tangible forms, along side basic researchers. Yes, there are issues; there are many brain dead institutes that enjoy funding n genuine ones who suffer. And more overall funding are welcome if we equate national average with GDP. But, this article feels more like Sheldon Cooper making Physicist master race arguement, that surprisingly ends in a compulsive suggestion on the very applied science it has been bashing . India ? Sure a country with more than 1 billion human beings don't know the difference between tech and science because some idiotic article said so.   **India still doesn’t know the difference between tech & science** and that's why A P J Abdul Kalam is considered by all and sundry to be a scientist.

Science/Technology,Need some career advice or advice for future plans.,20,ccdt2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccdt2p/need_some_career_advice_or_advice_for_future_plans/,5,"Very sorry for the wall of text. I hope this subreddit is the correct place for this post.

I want some career advice but I have no friends in the relevant fields to ask. I graduated in electrical engineering and learnt absolutely nothing and have no skills to get me a job in electrical field. So I turned to IT and worked there for 1 year and god it was shit. I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS. I quit last year and decided to give GATE-2019 in CS/IT paper to make my way into the computer science fields as I feel I am good at coding and stuff. I got AIR of 5300 in the GATE exam and am trying again for next year. (I'll continue with masters in whichever college I get if I don't get a good score this year too).

So now I'm completely clueless as for what my future plans are. Other than attempting GATE and doing masters. What am I supposed to do next? I feel like I don't have any practical skills to make myself employable. I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites. But I doubt that is enough to get me a job. I am thinking of learning some online courses and learn something other than C. But what should I learn? What do I have to learn to make myself employable? I understand that what I should start learning depends on which job I want to get into. But I can't decide and have no one to consult. I hear some buzzwords like data science and machine learning on the news and online but I don't know if that is right for me.

I thought of getting into the following fields: ML, Data science, Web development, Android development.

But again I have not the slightest idea of any of those. As far as I understand, ML and Data science requires more math and I can't say I'm good at math. With web development, I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding and wonder if it has good job opportunities here in India.

If you know any other good field with good opportunities in India please suggest.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I know that I have a goal. Which is to get a good coding related job. But I don't know how to get to that goal. Nor which technology I should get into. So please help me decide.",sumanthdbz," While preparing for 2020 , try to understand algorithms and data structures properly i mean give as much as you can. This is important because gate syllabus will cover basic required algorithms which is also essential for coding.

I am not a big coder but try web development it is basic requirement at least that is what i think. Many people said web development is in trend.

If you take X comapny try to prepare for it! There are resources like geeks for geeks that gives what kind of questions are asked for that company . They usually follow a trend. 

I am gonna do Mtech this year and  also just as clueless as you are. \> I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding

&#x200B;

What do you mean by traditional coding? If you think it's all just HTML & CSS, you're mistaken, Web Development over the years has grown by leaps and bounds and front-end engineering is a WHOLE thing by itself :) WebDev is a good place to start, even I really started understanding software systems & design when I started working on my first web development project - it's exciting to see a page display data they way you like it after pulling it from the database.

&#x200B;

\>  I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites.

&#x200B;

I'd say you're off to a pretty good start! Keep working on those Data Structure & Algorithms skills, you will really require them going forward! Especially in big companies, they'll ask you to solve one of those questions on a whiteboard/google doc as interviews.

&#x200B;

\> ML and Data science requires more math 

&#x200B;

You're right about this. Have you given that math a shot though? You may like it, you may not, you could check it out for yourself. A master's degree with an AI/ML specialization would be helpful if you wish to enter this field

&#x200B;

Web Development & Mobile Development have good opportunities I'd say - a lot of software engineering jobs entail familiarity with one of these. There's also DevOps which is mostly infrastructure that you could look into!

&#x200B;

For GATE prep if I'm not mistaken, the focus is on knowing C in and out, right? Like what will print(""%.02f"", 22/7) output as etc? (I maybe wrong) Then focus on doing well in these type of questions and the hackerrank type questions can wait till you're in a good college and prepping for jobs at big/good IT companies (like VMWare, Amazon, Microsoft, etc) [deleted] Are you from a Tier-1 college? If not it's going to be very difficult to get an interview in one of the large product based companies even if you get reasonably good (1700-1900 rating on Codeforces) at competitive programming. Despite being from Elect. Engg. securing 5300 rank in GATE is a good feat. You are already ahead of a significant section of GATE takers. So prepare hard this time and you'll definitely get into a great college. Once this happens, you can devote some time for properly learning AI/ML and other stuff and also guarantee yourself a good job. Since you studied Electrical Engineering and you are interested in software, Why not Embedded software? I think there are Universities that offer Embedded systems on a Mtech level.  I can recommend some courses on Coursera/edx on Embedded systems/ operating systems. I would recommend not to get into these buzzwords early in your career. If you are looking for a long technical career, get your basics right. As the other commenter suggested data structures/ algos. I would suggest operating systems/ Basics of databases/ Networking. Explore as much as possible during your Mtech.  Frankly the place you study matters only for your first job. But having a master's in ""any"" University compared to just having a Bachelor's can help you immensely especially getting a higher starting grade when you start.",2019-07-13 01:23:58

My branch is environmental engineering, I chose it by mistake and honestly have no interest in it neither it is a good career to persue in India because of less jobs and low salary. I have interest in Computer Science and wish to persue it as my career. So I have 2 options  at the moment. Study CS on my own and try to land an off campus job which is very dificult I've heard from seniors, or I could take admission in DU in BSc computer science this year in colleges like SSCBS or Hansraj. My 12th percentage was 94.75% and I have already cleared the sscbs cutoff, and might also clear the Hansraj cutoff in upcoming lists.
My aim is land a well paying  job after college. DTU has a lot of non tech placements in analyst/consulting roles which are open for all branches and most non Cs students opt for that. I don't know much about that field and if it is right for me or not.
If I go for DU colleges, they don't have good placements after Bsc and one would have to go for masters like MBA/Ms in India or abroad.
What should I do? Continue in DTU or join Hansraj or SSCBS?
Please Help.",boltz11," It's not too late for you to switch your field. You are still first year which means there is no better time. Take the leap.
Good luck! Continue in dtu. Contact your placement departnent. See what non-tech roles you can get. Do you want a stable job and regular money supply, eventhough it is small? 

Stay with DTU. 

Want to hunt for jobs or struggle if you can't find one and then again get into the cycle of giving papers and all? 

Go to BSc, as you said no good placement. 

My advice, stay in DTU. 

The focus the world is giving to environment and nature, can lend you a good job, and you really can't predict down the line that what will be job sector in next 3 years. 

Although, if you wish to study CSE, then study on your own, participate in coding competitions and learn core subjects of CSE like Algorithms, Data Structures, Databases. 

Dude, you have backing of DTU. Trust me brand name works in India. 

Also, you would have a professional degree in Btech, BSc ke baad MSc karega, then again 5 years down the line, you can't predict anything. 

Do your btech, study core subjects of CSE, try to go for companies. 

Atleast 3 saal baad job toh milegi, cse ya non cse. 

Also, ek baar apne placement cell se bhi baat kar liyo. 

ATB. Dude BSc CS is not a good option, and i am saying this after completion of BSc CS from DU, i will say stick with Btech , and if you really want, try for different branch by taking drop, dont look ar 2yrs gap , because if you do get good college and cs branch, nothing matters after that.
After Bsc you have to again face competition for MCA so i will say Btech is the best option you can go with Disclaimer: I am a final year Dtuite, ece branch.

The information seniors have given you is kind of correct. It is true that the majority of coding companies won't be open for your branch, heck truth be told only 5-10 total companies would be open for ene.

However, Amazon, MS, Uber , Citibank and Samsung are almost open for all the branches . So here are your two choices, either utilise the time you have and practice coding. Join coding blocks or Ninja and work hard. Your branch will always be a handicap for you, this is the bitter truth. Companies do discriminate over your branch. Ene is an easy branch so spend your time wisely. Otherwise try for higher studies. The last person from our College to go to Stanford was from ene only. 

Maintain 8.5+ cgpa,work hard and by the virtue of your hard work and luck, you'll give yourself a great future.",2019-06-28 14:09:01
Science/Technology,Need for a change of school culture and the hype around class 10th and 12th board exams,37,bn13id,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bn13id/need_for_a_change_of_school_culture_and_the_hype/,8,"I am currently a Ph.D. in Biology student at a university in the United States of America. I completed my class 10th in 2006, and my class 12th in 2008. I scored 78.3% and 72% in the aforementioned board exams, respectively. During my school years, I was never a meritorious student. I was rather among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section academically. However, I worked really hard for my class 10th board exam and was deeply affected by the final percentage I scored. I did pretty well in the mock exams that I used to give at the private tuition center I took to help my academic performance and scored much more than many of friends majority of whom ended up scoring more than 85% in the final board examination.

&#x200B;

Till my class 10th, I studied at a prestigious public school in Delhi. As per the school's rule, a student could only be offered Science, if he/she scored more than 80% in English, Science, and Mathematics combined. My score was 77.7%, and therefore, was offered humanities and commerce. The rule didn't make sense as I scored 94% in Science, and my mathematics scores were always among the top 5-15% of the high scoring students in my section.  Therefore, I changed schools to study Science, and today I am earning a top-most degree in a field in which my school thought I was not a good fit.

&#x200B;

I suffered from depression and lack of confidence before my class 10th. I used to be good at cricket, but I suffered in that as well. My school carried a culture where if you are not good academically, then you are hopeless in other extra-curricular activities as well. I wanted to do academically well in school (prior to my class 10th), but the lack of confidence made it really difficult to come out of the shell and raise myself to glory (yes, being a good student did seem like a glory). I was so terrified that I would be scared to even open my textbooks.

&#x200B;

Not being able to get Science made things worse. I lost even more hope, and this worsened my mental health for my class 12th board exam. I remember praying to score at least more than 60% a night before the results. But, today if I could talk to my younger self, my recommendation would be to not lose hope and enjoy doing what you like. However, I still not sure if the environment that I lived would help. In my school days, I was compelled to feel like an outlaw for being among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section.

&#x200B;

Recently, an article came out on Hindu, about a mother congratulating her son for scoring 60% in class 10th. She says that she had seen her son struggle to the point of giving up, and therefore, was proud of the final scores he got. In my time, my parents were also in full support of me. So was my father, who had always been strict. My father would never come to the parents-teachers meeting, as I was not up to the standards he expected of me. But, after my class 10th, he was very supportive and backed me at every point possible. Getting this sort of support from this person was huge for me then. He tried his level best to make a case to my school principal as to why I deserve to be a science student for the last two years of schooling. But, I remember walking down the school corridor with my parents trying to make a last attempt to convince my school principal, I met my Geography teacher. She congratulated me sarcastically and ridiculed me (in front of my parents) of how bad of a student I was before. It has been 13 years since that gesture, but the instance is still registered in my memory from word to word.

&#x200B;

Therefore, this makes me wonder, whether how much of a support system would your parents be if you have such teachers and cultures inculcated in schools. At that time, my parent's support didn't help me much. In fact, it made me feel even more horrible for being responsible for letting them go through such tough situations. Manier times. especially I like to believe in my case, low scores in class 10th are due to a stroke of sheer bad luck. But, the impact is grave for a naive 16-year-old.

&#x200B;

The point I am trying to make is that in addition to having a good support system from one's parents, the school's culture of dealing with young students needs to change. Teachers have a big responsibility of training future entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers etc, and therefore need to pay proper regard to a students self-esteem and self-confidence. What might just seem to be a simple comment (and here I don't include the personal issues that teacher might sometime have) the repercussions on the student's mental health might be huge.

&#x200B;

Ironically, I got to know about this below-given news article from the same geography teacher's Facebook post. She was cheering this wonderful mother for her attempt to lift the pressure off the head of her son' young mind. I first felt like commenting directly about the hypocrisy she has shown to me at the least. But, I think I should probably try to let this memory go of my head and move on.

My mother’s a teacher, and I have literally seen her give advice to her student’s parents to give their children more freedom to find their passions, to have fun and to focus on then learning skills and confidence, rather than focusing on marks. But when it came to me, it was get marks or die. 

I think part of the problem is that in India there are so few means of evaluating a person beyond their marks. When applying to US universities, you have to write essays, jot down your clubs and extra-curricular activities, the interview will focus on the things you spend time on outside the classroom etc. The marks themselves are just the bare minimum. I feel in India the marks are supreme. I bet the entrance exam culture doesn’t help either.

It also sucks that there are so few premier institutions in India to study at, relative to our population. The US has flagship state colleges in every state, and at least 2 or 3 other unis that are fairly good, not to mention private world-class unis like Stanford and Harvard etc. We needs more high-quality institutes of higher learning, spread out throughout the country. The way they hype the importance of 10th board exams is sad. And the coaching classes are taking full advantage of it. 

My 10th board results stopped being useful once I got an admission in FYJC. I've grown up around people who often compared their kids to others and the first subject in hand is always to flex if their kid scored 90%. My parents have been really supportive though they never forced me to ""get better grades"" but I often felt I let 'em down which usually let to anxiety and depressing about the fact I'm no good.

To be honest I don't blame them marks are the only way around here to evaluate candidates for anything. Only if had been a more holistic evaluation but that's certainly out of the question because then only meritocracy will reign. I don't think everyone can  afford a school that emphasises on communication skills or everyone can buy a guitar just so to learn an instrument. Not giving freedom to children to pursue whatever they want is one of the main reason india is behind many countries in terms of innovation and in olympics.",2019-05-11 01:26:12

Thank you!

EDIT: I have 2 years drop that is the reason  I am more worried.",Kaori4Kousei," [deleted] good to see that you are emphasizing on learning new technologies in first year itself. unlike the  majority who keep mugging up just for grades There are 2 parts about Computer Vision. Theory and practice. Theoretical computer vision is quite difficult and requires a certain degree of knowledge in linear algebra as you mentioned. The practical part of it - not so much. You have OpenCV for that.

This is shallow but given that you're just in your first year, you should definitely try out OpenCV with Python. It's quite simple and the library has implementation for a lot of stuff. The problem with learning just the theory is that you don't see any reward and it's very difficult to continue. But if you make some software which does some cool stuff, albeit simple, you'd feel rewarded and you'd actually like to continue doing so.

So if you are really interested in learning computer vision, spend your 40-50% of time (that you spend learning linear algebra) in making things and rest of it in learning the theory. [deleted]",2019-04-29 19:17:25

NEW DELHI: A central panel, set up in April to study the role of cow urine and dung in curing diseases and scientific validation of uniqueness of indigenous cows, is likely to have its first meeting next month when it will assign various projects to ministries and institutions.The panel, headed by science and technology minister Harsh Vardhan , will evaluate the role of 'Panchagavya' — a concoction of cow urine mixed with cow dung, milk, curd and ghee — in four broad areas like medicine, products for agriculture applications, food and nutrition and utility products.Besides eminent scientists like former CSIR director general R A Mashelkar, the panel has members from RSS and VHP-linked organisations. The tenure of this panel will be for three years. ""Though the panel — National Steering Committee NSC ) — was constituted long ago, it could not meet so far due to one or the other important engagements of its members,"" said V K Vijay of the Centre for Rural Development and Technology (CRDT), IITDelhi. He is one of the members of the 19-member panel.Amid indication of its first meeting some time next month, Vijay told TOIon Sunday that the panel will function as an apex body for guiding a national programme on 'Scientific Validation and Research on Panchgavya'.TOI had in February reported the government's plan to form such a committee. The panel includes chancellor of Nalanda University in Bihar Vijay P Bhatkar, IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao and secretaries of the departments of science & technology, biotechnology and renewable energy. Other members include Sunil Mansinghka of VHPlinked Go Vigyan Anusandhan Kendra which has long been involved in research on cow urine and cow dung.

Science/Technology,Advice needed for B-School.,7,ccqp9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccqp9z/advice_needed_for_bschool/,1,"I am doing a Bsc in Information Technology from a reputed college, placements are decent in our college, last year average was 4.5 lacs and highest was 18 lacs, this sounds pretty good for a college with very low fees but i don't see myself doing something in IT field, i cleared the entrances for VIT,KIIT,SRM,Manipal,COMEDK and few others but i did not join any of them for the very same reason, i was pushed into science by my parents and they were also forcing me to join KIIT(which i still can join) but i convinced them somehow for a Bsc as placements in KIIT were not as tempting as they had expected. I choose Bsc due to it's short duration, cost effectiveness and  curriculum was not much different from engineering if you don't include first year of engineering. 

&#x200B;

It's a relief for me that i only have to study 3 years in Bsc, now coming to the main question, at the end of three years, an MBA seems to me to be the most plausible way of getting out of this mess, my previous academics (10th,12th) are good and i can also score good my graduation.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Choose Bsc over Btech (don't like either of the two), want to do an mba.

&#x200B;

Now these are my questions :-

1) Does doing a Bsc instead of a Btech will have a negative impact during admission in B-Schools?

2) Are all these great packages that the top B-School pride themselves on are only for IITs/NITs graduates etc? 

3) What would you recommend for a person in a situation like this?

&#x200B;

If not top IIMs, i can surely get in top 10 schools.

&#x200B;

P.S - 1)My parents wanted me to do graduation only in CS,IT or Electronics, i have also cleared few entrances for BBA.

2) Money is not a problem, i'm open to all suggestions.

3) I want to go for a degree just after Bsc and don't want to work.",Ash_Sss," 1. Go for BSc, if you really want to go for MBA. Saves you from General Engineering Male (GEM) category.  

2. A BTech from an eminent institution can do wonders for you, no doubt about it. To strengthen your profile, take some work ex, if possible. 
Do things which strengthen your CV.   

3. Life has many ways of making you where you want to be and don't be overconfident about your abilities. 
Life will fucking test you, hope you pass with flying colors.   

Also, don't make MBA your main goal, venture out, hope you find something interesting.   

All the best.",2019-07-13 23:40:33
Science/Technology,India's largest scientific research and development body CSIR declares financial emergency,153,6fd2l8,http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/indias-largest-scientific-research-and-development-body-csir-declares-financial-emergency,35,,pakaomat," [deleted] Only if CSIR would have agreed to participate in Cow urine research!!! So what if I wanted research, done by Govt scientists, to be made open to all Indians? Honestly a lot of CSIR labs are absolutely bullshit. They have a lot of fat to trim. 

We had a lab called ""Central Building Research Institute"" at IIT Roorkee, and I they didn't do jack shit. When 38 billion out of 40 billion rupees is spent on salaries and pensions and only 2 billion on research, you know this organization has become a bloated inefficient behemoth. 

 My dad worked there for plenty of years. Says the Institute is corrupt as fuck with very little original research actually comes out. Quite a lot of scientists indulge in petty corruption and a ,ajor requirement is to be a brown noser and not a good scientist if you want to advance your career. If the government demanded a result oriented approach these guys probably failed to deliver and will continue to fail to deliver (although admittedly doing research like that is also not quite possible.) >Recently, CSIR’s Director-General Girish Sahni claimed that most of CSIR’s patents were “bio-data patents”, filed solely to enhance the value of a scientist’s resume and that the extensive expenditure of public funds spent in filing and maintaining patents was unviable. CSIR claims to have licensed a percentage of its patents, but has so far failed to show any revenue earned from the licences.

[Source] (http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-compulsive-patent-hoarding-disorder/article17617888.ece) 

CSIR had it coming. I don't know why they cannot earn money from their researches if they are doing so much substantial research. ISRO does it and look where it is now; developed its own cryogenic technology . You don't see them begging for funds because they have successfully managed their organisation. And the government doesn't interfere. 

I will be glad if government stop pouring taxpayers money into those other money sucking black holes like Air India, BSNL etc. 

 Why would Modiji give a shit about scientific research and development when he has a full fledged ayush ministry?  Jackass and his govt spends thousands of crores on mindless statues and TV, print, youtube ads, but somehow ran out of money for CSIR? Fucking imbeciles.  Increase taxes to buy nuclear submarines from BJP donors. But no money to fund research. Science reporter",2017-06-05 17:11:36
Science/Technology,Our Robots (Mitra) Vs Their Robots (Boston Dynamics),126,8z99fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8z99fw/our_robots_mitra_vs_their_robots_boston_dynamics/,95,"Let me preface this by saying that the intention of this post is neither to mock science/engineering/robotics in India, nor to pin the blame on the current government. I am just acknowledging the wide gap. 

Today I woke up to a tweet by IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad which showed a robot called Mitra made by an Indian company. The robot looked amusingly simple, like a bigger version of the toys I had as a child. See it here: 

> Nice to meet Mitra- the robot during Goa IT day that has been developed by an Indian startup. #DigitalIndia

> https://twitter.com/rsprasad/status/1018473949229826048?s=09

I was intrigued and searched for it. I came across this video which shows the same robot greeting Ivanka Trump when she visited India. The robot enters with drumbeats:

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_irZMn5JeB0

The only function this robot could do was roll around with remote control and respond to a simple touch screen press. It kind of failed the second task because the maker did not think the process through (PM and Ivanka both press the button together and it got stuck on the next screen). This is the technology we were showcasing to the world.

On the other hand, we have Boston Dynamics. I remember seeing their Big Dog robot almost a decade back and it had blown my mind back then. See how it corrects itself even after being kicked:

>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gi6Ohnp9x8

They have many incredible robots. Here is their human shaped version:

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY

It can walk on uneven surface, on snow, lift objects...the bastard can get up when knocked over. Their other robots can climb stairs, [open doors](https://youtu.be/fUyU3lKzoio?t=13s) (velociraptor from Jurassic Park?) and even run. Imagine [this guy chasing you](https://youtu.be/wE3fmFTtP9g?t=57s)! 

These guys are building fucking terminators while we are still stuck at creating toys that you can buy at Hamleys :(",kash_if," Theres a lot to unpack here. Technology like that requires SIGNIFICANT research. Which requires funding, infrastructure and most importantly people. We have a significant amount of brain drain where the aspirations of tLehe best and brightest is to go abroad for further research. Colleges in India aren't as  research focused as is required to truly build world class instutions. I studied in an NIT and the MTech students were treated very poorly and had to fight for even the most basic infrastructure.  Mitra was brought to my college. The mechanics, computer vision and the actual neural network all clearly looked terrible. 

It was no more a robot than a shitty little chinese  toy. It moved slowly (on wheels). It was capable of asking pre fed questions. It honestly looked like a remote controlled moving computer screen.

I cannot put into words how tatti it is.

Even trying to compare it to Boston Dynamics and others should be considered offensive. Mitra is not even worthy of being called a fuckin robot. Its a plastic toy. Balaji Vishwanathan, the famous Modi bhakt on Quora is its creator. No wonder they let this piece of plastic showcase in GES Hyderabad. It's embarrassing. Many people have called it out. https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7mf6d7/balaji_vishwanathans_mitra_robot_explained/ 1. There is no such thing as research or serious scholarship in India, barring some arts and humanities departments.

2. Teaching in STEM is a joke. Most professors and PhDs are not qualified to even take very basic introductory courses. It's an absolute shit show

3. Funding is abysmal. Resources are non-existent. Intellectual cultural or environment is absent. All this government cares about is vedic science.

4. Brain drain, yes, everyone with an ounce of potential and opportunity fucks off to abroad, because this country is hopeless. It's run by goons, full of outdated laws, unnecessary bureaucracy, lack of institutions that can foster scientific temperament and facilities.  

You want good things? You want India to be able to do stuff other countries so casually do. Look around you. Look at the poverty, and look at who is governing the country. Then wallow in your disappointment. 

It'll take another 50 years for Indian middle class to grow substantially that your aspirations becomes the aspirations of the average citizen, enough to shake the goon foundation of Indian politics and destroy it. 

Be glad ISRO at least capable of shit.  Mitra is surely not representative of Indian robotics. One of the reasons this robot gets so much attention is the undeniable fact that the founder Balaji Vishwanathan is a famous unapologetic hindutva sympathizer. Self marketing is something he does very well.  

That being said there are some really promising robotic startups that gets limited attention. Check out Grey Orange,  Sastra robotics and Asimov Robotics.  You got the name wrong, the name is not mitra its TATTI The answer is quite simple, India doesn't have money for *stupid* things like Science and Technology. Here is a [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01504-5?referral=true) describing India's abysmal stand over R&D:
> Despite the cash injection, India’s spending on science will remain relatively low, at around 0.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). That is well below the 3% that researchers demanded in August during ‘march for science’ events around the country. “There appears to have been only 8–10% rise in various scientific departments on average, which, factoring in inflation, is not much,” says Krishna Ganesh, founding director of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Tirupati. “Nowhere are we even near 1% of GDP.”

I am doing Masters in USA after doing undergrad (from a reputed institute mentioned in the article) in India and I can see the difference quite well myself. Atmosphere is more conducive, funding is way higher and the most important: people at the top (politicians etc.) actually want to develop and explore Science  than do it just because they are in charge of that portfolio. Mitra is a kids toy at best. For ages 5-9. They can backflip too.
https://youtu.be/fRj34o4hN4I They're not even choosing the right products to show-off. While I admit that no Indian project has ever reached the level of Boston Dynamics we can definitely do something better than Mitra. Thousands of college students in the country are making things like [Mars Rovers](http://urc.marssociety.org/), [Race cars](http://www.formulabharat.com/) and fucking satellites which are more sophisticated than this thing.  Our Indian robot looks like from Jio institute of eminence 😂 I think comparison of Boston Dynamics and Asimov with Mitra bot is little bit flawed because the former have millions of dollars at their disposal and have been working at this field for a long time. 

But I will agree with this part- Mitra bot is literally a toy that could be found in Hamleys. It is nothing but a shining example of doorways that bootlicking and shilling can achieve. I think this comparison is completely stupid. Mitra as Balaji explained it is a robot  focussing for communication and entertainment. This is new and they are building things from scratch. 

Boston dynamics work on maneuvering, and train on different terrains, and are trained to handle complex motor tasks.

A robot specializing for communication can actually look like a toy or r2d2, and will have good time with families, elderly and the ill. 

A robot specializing for locomotion like a biped, quadriped is out to beat the shit of terrorists and has no business in entertainment.

Now, there is not a huge gulf of quality in communication robots. What separates different communication robots is actually motor skills, which is not in their niche but an extra random feature. Like old companies like Honda has.

People using a communication robot to innaugrate a function, why is there any problem in that ? Somebody had an idea, they gave it to Mitra team, they executed it, as per their capacity. If some institute wants to say that they have built better robots in this niche, they should actively look to grab these opportunities. 
 
Anybody who works in NLP and deep learning knows how merky these things are, and how apple-orange comparison is this. 
 I don't expect anything less from Balaji Vishwanathan I am going to make a human shaped Amazon Alexa and name it 'Mitron'. We are soon going to have our very own Real steel matches.
This is development for sure. I don't know much about Mitra , as far as I know its more focused on NLP and this is just a prototype. Comparing it to Boston dynamics is funny, as both of them target different industries.   
While boston dynamic focus on robotic manoeuvring, localisation and better control dynamics, Mitra doesn't intend to compete it.  


FYI , before bashing anyone just google Greyorange (clients include Amazon, HUL and so on) , Arav UAV ( built the whole flight controller and image processing engine from scratch ).   


Please upgrade your knowledge about robotics first, secondly there are many other companies under the hood doing good job. You certainly lack good research.   
 Yes its not like they're based out of a country with a significant higher GDP, much better academic infrastructure and a more conducive research and business environment or anything. Different budgets, different things they are going for, different use cases.

When that company gets 200 million dollars to burn. They will make something like boston dynamics.

If you want to feel better, Youtube for acyut. It was a small humanoid robot build by a couple of engineering kids on a small budget. Also went on to found grey orange robotics.",2018-07-16 16:40:51
Science/Technology,"What is the most practical, innovative way to manage plastic waste in metropolitan cities?",26,a39gnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a39gnj/what_is_the_most_practical_innovative_way_to/,34,"What, according to you, is a practical approach to plastic waste management in the cities?

Is the crux of the problem awareness of the junta or execution by the municipal corporation to provide effective machinery and systems to tackle garbage?

If you were given some kind funding, how could you contribute towards this cause?

There are various categories in this kind of management. For example, technology, packaging, research (citizen science) or just awareness. What according to you does India need right now? 

I recently watched videos on how birds die after eating plastic. Their stomachs are full of small tiny plastic bits, some upto 200 small pieces. They eventually choke on a piece and die. This is common near the beaches.

Packaging is the biggest contributor to plastic waste. How can we reduce this?",paintedpineapple," Rwanda has banned plastic bags in their entire country. Yes, it is a small country with a population of 10 million (but more densely populated than India) and very poor too. But just have a look at how clean their capital city Kigali is. Not innovative, but a very traditional idea: recycle. There are nations that use more plastic than us, but recycle most of it, hence have less plastic pollution. 
Setting up recycling centres can be very useful in the long run.  [Make Roads](https://www.thebetterindia.com/43685/plastic-waste-in-road-construction-plastic-man-india-prof-vasudevan/) Firstly, all single use plastics should be totally banned. No plastic in food and beverage packaging. This itself will reduce a huge chunk of waste. In other cases, reusing should be encouraged, and if possible, enforced.  Plastic bags are a blessing to us poor to lower class people. I get a plastic bag when I buy some rice dal, eat rice on it using it as plate. Then take it to a water pipe and when no one is around I fill it with water. I wash my hands face and drink water. I throw it out after that. Some people use them to do latrine since they have blocked the defecation areas due to hybin issue. If the government could subsidize the manufacture of paper bags to the point it becomes cheaper than plastic bags, then we could probably have this problems solved. This would require some work to understand how paper bag can be maufactured at a lower cost. The only way to solve a problem like this is to incentivize the usage of other products. The root cause here is overpopulation. We need to spread out our settlements so that waste management becomes easier. With 10 million people in a city, it doesn't take much individual contribution to create a HUGE amount of waste.  Complete and strict ban on production, sale and usage of plastic. 1. Reduce-reuse-recycle. That's the sequence to manage all kinds of waste including plastics. 
2. Correct segregation of waste is the first step that needs to be taken care  at point of waste creation. 
3. The 3 bin method is the best for household waste. Wet (green waste 50-55% by weight), dry (recyclables 30-35%) and reject (hazardous10%). If waste is segregated at the household level it increases the recyclability, reduces the amount of weight going to the landfill. Green waste can ideally be composted locally.
4. A separate place for discarding e- waste.
5. Many colonies in Gurgaon, Pune and Bangalore are already doing this.

There is less of rocket science and more of plain old method and discipline that we lack in waste management.",2018-12-05 13:57:51

Science/Technology,Organisations like silverzone and SOF are ruining the prestige of olympiads in India.,189,8r87e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8r87e7/organisations_like_silverzone_and_sof_are_ruining/,53,"As most of you DO NOT know, there are 6 major olympiads organised for school students (there are 12 major science olympiads, but these 6 offer the most incentives).

These are->

1) International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)

2) International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)

3) International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)

4) International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO)

5) International Astronomy Olympiad (IAO)

6) International Olympiad of Linguistics (IOL)

All of these are extremely prestigious olympiads, which one can not take part in directly. They have various stages in which they sieve out children, and in the end a team of 4-6 children represents a country in these international olympiads. Olympiads organised by silverzone/SOF are misdirecting people into a false sense of prestige, and are making big bucks doing so. They sell admit cards, workbooks, text books, past year papers and whatnot. They even go as far as to copy the names of these olympiads exactly as they are.

Here's an incident: A friend of mine is an IMO bronze medallist, and he shared this fact one day with his relatives. His aunt was quick to respond that her daughter was in fact a gold medal holder in IMO. When he asked which year was the IMO, and where it was held, she told him that the olympiad took place in her daughter's school just a week ago. Here's the kicker, the real IMO has never taken place in India since its inception, and only 11 people in India have won a gold medal.

Just wanted to let out this quick rant. Dont waste your money on these hoax olympiads, and then go on and brag about how your child is a gold medal holder.

A few colleges in India offer admission on the basis of participation in these olympiads, and I was shocked when people from silverzone/SOF olympiads were lining up to claim their seats. Needless to say, they all got rejected, but what was even sadder is that they did not even know about the big 6 olympiads.

If you have been selected into the training camp of any of these 6 olympiads, you can get admission to Chennai Mathematical Institute(one of the best mathematics school in india) and IIIT-H(International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad). You are also selected for an interview at ISI(Indian Statistical Institute) if you have been a member of IMO-TC(training camp for IMO). These are some of the incentives to participate in these olympiads.

EDIT: correction, IMO was held in India once in 1996

EDIT2: India actually participates in almost all the major olympiads.",thescoobynooby," Is it possible to enter Olympiads without being affiliated with a school? I was probably twice a bronze medallist in one of those SOF olympiads, science one - district level, sad to know all this. Also, anyone took the ASSET exam ? I still have that card with me Maybe I am in the minority, but as far I have seen, a good number of serious candidates actually know about the big 6 and the pointlessness of SOF Olympiads. At the very least, such serious kids also score well in NTSE/KVPY and other prestigious exams.

But it is indeed a sad state of affair that a lot of people haven't even *heard* of these. Two of my classmates gave the state qualifiers and went till the national camp but couldn't make it into the International tournament. I have given one of those fake ass IMO in my school where it is completely subjective with questions coming from the NCERT books. It completely felt like giving Pre-boards. 
  And at beginners level, if you want your kids to participate in any such olympiads (other than the big six), please avoid silver zone, SOF and eduheal. Go for unified council olympiads instead. They are somewhat better. And their BMA workbooks are far superior than the SOF workbooks. 

The big six can get very tough. I tried preparing for RMO but gave up in the preparation stage. It was hard for me. 

So please don’t force your kids to do that if they don’t have the aptitude. 

Also look for the government scholarship tests, they are reputable and prestigious and can give you an edge in admissions/jobs. Like NTSE, KVPY etc.  >Here's the kicker, the real IMO has never taken place in India since its inception, and only 11 people in India have won a gold medal.

Correction, [It has, in 1996.](https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=1996) Woah dude, your friend is a legend for getting a bronze in IMO. There was a Change.org petition which wanted to force these organizations to drop the word Olympiad from their name so as to preserve the name.


Also, slight clarification, India does participate in IPO and IESO (Philosophy and Earth Science). And IOL is just International Linguistics Olympiad. IMO took place in India in 1996 I believe !  Do you have any reliable resources regarding the big six Vs SOF?

I'm asking because my old school is a regular participant of the SOF Olympiads (heck, I came third in their English one. )

I could send that info to them so they could reconsider supporting them.  You forgot the junior Olympiads : IJSO and IOAA (Junior science and junior astronomy Olympiads).  You also missed the [International Biology Olympiad (IBO)](http://www.ibo-info.org/). India hosted the IBO in 2008, at HBCSE, Mumbai.

Until about 2010-11, students who represented India at any of the ""hard science"" olympiads could get admission into the IISERs. IIRC, they stopped Olympiad-stream admissions around the same time the IISERs got their own entrance test.  I'd say IMSc tops CMI (studied there), but its still a really close call. JEE destroyed India's potential in the International olympiads.",2018-06-15 12:24:05

i highly recommend that you start with reading up about the visa (Specifically H1B and green card) system for employed foreigners in the USA.

Please do this before you start looking at universities. Andha paisa hai? >1) Which is the earliest session he can target? (R3/R4 deadlines seem to have gone by)

Earliest season deadlines are in August/September. Some schools have ""Early Action"" which may be June/July.


>2) Where do get the list of universities which to target. (Media and Advertising is his preference)


https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/marketing-rankings

Do not go below top 20.

>3) What should be the ballpark/vague idea of score without which not to proceed?

Hard to tell as this depends on entire profile. But, At least 700+ for Indian men.

>4) Can appearing multiple times for GMAT have repurcussions? (except the ones incurred by pocket)

No. Most schools take highest score.

>5) What is lumpsum figure for fee (can he can expect to be offered scholarship based on GMAT score)

Tuition around $120k total for two years. Living expenses depends on the city. But budget around $80k-$100k for living expenses for two years. Likelihood of scholarship in top 20 schools is very low based on your profile. If you go below top 20 schools, you may get a scholarship based on GMAT, but you may not get a job.

>6) He is a merchandiser and has been in this industry for 3 years. He has worked for one start up also(pretty crucial role), can leaving his current job for 2-3 months for preparation have negative impact? (in terms of Recommendation letter, Work experience etc.)

Depends on the rapport with the person who will give recommendation letter. Small gaps won't likely have huge impact on application. But three years of overall experience is very low for US b-schools where the median is 5 years and for Indian applicants, it's likely around 7-8 years.


>7) How to not suck at SOP and Essay Writing? (We have no idea except what google told us on how to proceed with this)

Use someone who has done this to review your essays and give you input.

**In addition to the questions above, read up about H1-B visas. With an MBA, you only get one chance at H1-B lottery (chance of getting one is around 30%-40%).

2. Arxiv - jornals and papers
3. 2 minutes papers YouTube channel - ML stuff 
4. IEEE platform - scientific papers Use Twitter.

I, for one, use Linus Tech Tips on Youtube (MKBHD is too mainstream IMO), also Seeker, D-News, SciShow.

Science/Technology,[p] how the hell did china end up with an extremely pro science government and india with an anti science government?,310,6nztwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6nztwo/p_how_the_hell_did_china_end_up_with_an_extremely/,348,"i just finished reading an article on chinese governments push on Artificial Intelligence. They are about to spend $8B as compared to US's $20.7B. China is ordering its top universities to create courses based around AI and has asked their tech firms to work with govt and develop AI startups and technology.       



How is china busy with developing modern medicines, vaccines, supercomputers and india is wasting time with gomutra/ayurveda etc?       




i keep seeing articles on madhya pradesh hospitals creating astrology based medical consulting, government promoting ayurveda, gomutra or intellectuals in our top universities talking about how ancient india already had created everything etc.      



Will india ever catch up with china on scientific breakthroughs and research? Will our leaders ever take a pro-science stance and create massive machine learning/AI laboratories or breakthroughs in Biotech/modern medicines like china is doing? or will we keep orbiting around our ancient scriptures and hopelessly keep watching as US/EU/CHN/JAP lead this world by researching and creating all the new technologies that we use?         



edit: pardon my incoherent ranting as i am feeling very frustrated after realizing there is hardly any world class research going on in my country while the important powers seem to be marching ahead ",noelgallagherisgod," Forget China. Here in TN I can't even argue with guys who are engineering graduates. Idiots considering anything Science as Western conspiracy. Now they have learned a new term called Illuminati. Even providing facts we can't argue with them. A few days back a stupid guy was claiming everything as Illuminati and Toothpaste cause mouth cancer. That video even went viral. [deleted] Cultural revolution. The Mao purges destroyed the previous intellegensia. The people who held on to cultural traditions and religious practices were more or less wiped out. This virtually annihilated most anti-science bastions across China. Initially it stagnated the economy and society but overtime after Mao's death new intellectuals not tied to religion or tradition emerged. It was like the Enlightenment except on a smaller scale. The Chinese learnt their lesson from the purges and coupled with the lessons over the refusal of the Manchu's in the 19 th Century from adopting western tech, the current atmosphere in intellectual pursuits in China is more or less adapt or die. You can make fun of all the copy carting Chinese industries try to do, but it does actually do a fair amount to encourage innovation. That is the R&D departments get to fiddle with new stuff. I genuinely believe that modern copyright laws are impeding development of new tech, thus when the Chinese copy western tech they are able to learn new stuff reverse engineer and eventually make something new. I think the main difference is single party rule in China. This allows them to work on long term goals spanning decades.

In India any govt hv to balance popular move for next elections with long term goals. Off late the short term goals are getting more and more priority over the long term ones So many hyperbole answers. 

China is communist country and by principle religion is not important. (Marx's famous -Religion is opium of masses' anyone?)

75% population don't subscribe to any religion in china.

Source 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_China

Now that religion is not important and out of government, science will definitely flourish. 
 Priority. I am not talking about the priority based on each of their ideology, but, Chinese government is not worried about election or opposition. But since, India is a democracy the most important priority for any party is to keep the votes in tact. If Government spends 8B$ on research and development, how many votes do you think the party is going to get ? But instead if they do some jumla like writing of farmer's loan or something populist, that will make them more popular.

Ayurveda, Gomutra, Ancient India myths are all jumlas to secure the nationalist votes! 

 I think it's because of religion. China is largely [atheist.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_China) Who needs science when everything is written in scriptures? Communism denigrates religion as just another 'opium for the masses' and as such any sort of pandering to superstition or tradition is ruthlessly stamped out where it might actually affect the country's economy or real-world progress in any way.

In order to be a Party member of good standing you pretty much have to be atheist and openly so. Any hint of belonging to any religion will be considered a black mark and will be a problem in everything from job interviews to applying for loans. In such an environment being rational and scientific is possible. If someone in China suggests doing research to see if rhino horn actually is an aphrodisiac they will be laughed at.

Unfortunately we have an uneducated chaiwala who saw fit to name a 10th pass actress as Minister for Education and put a priest on the CM's chair of our most populous state. All of these recent outbreaks of gau-love are simply people who hope that pandering to these people will get them noticed and promoted in the party hierarchy. Unpopular opinion. I think our government is pro science. But our research system is highly awful, it works on generating journal papers after papers. The science grants doesn't demand a definitive result, and most of the time its just research for the sake of research. Our system works on the number of journal articles, not the quality and result oriented research is almost absent. Don't forget you all went to schools in India and were taught math and science, not witchcraft.  >i keep seeing articles on madhya pradesh hospitals creating astrology based medical consulting

This was fake news.

 You're calling a government ""anti-science"" that has:

- doubled ISRO funding

- explicitly sought to make R&D cooperation across the board a major priority in foreign policy (Israel, Germany, etc.)

- invested public money in tech-based start ups 

- increased funding for unis' R&D

- gone out of its way to woo tech manufacturing (to the point of even bothering to sit down and attempting to negotiate a special tax deal with Apple. Yes I know it didn't work out.)

- etc.

If you want to focus on a few just bizarre clickbaity articles about gaumutra or whatever, that's on you. But let's not let our biases delude the facts. We have a conservative right wing government in the centre which has the urgency to say, ""Hindus have mentioned about those scientific investments in Upanishads/Vedas"", after every scientific inventions or discoveries. This government wants to give scientific flavour to its religion, so that they wouldn't have inferiority complex for the stupid things they do in the name of religion. Everyone knows cow is just another animal, but stupids here say it exhales oxygen, trying to give it a scientific flavour. We are doomed. The Chinese are probably in middle of building spaceship parts to reach Alpha Centauri and achieve Science Victory. 
/civ5 Chinese govt is not that much pro science. investing in science does not get you votes. Investing in distractions (religious dogma, frothy nationalism, muslim hate, dalit subjugation...) gets you votes.  Two words: Illiterate Ministers. Atheism and thus science is better accepted in China. While religion and science can co-exist, typically it's easier when a country is non-religious culturally and socially, and thus politically as well. Indian doesnt have any resources or talent for pursuing engineering research at any university except for a couple of IITs. With no money comes no scientific development. Engineers at low tier universities like DU or MU are not even aware of the fact the engineering is about research and technical development and not just to get a IT job at consulting companies.

Defense research by DRDO is also being pulled back by babus just so that they can earn a commission from importing weapons from Russia (some boforce scam) or Israel (semi automatic weapons for the army) when drdo is perfectly capable of developing and has developed fully automatic rifles.

When it comes to low cost medical operations, India is leading the frontier but india is still far behind when it comes to cutting edges medical research and drug development again due to patent laws and lack of funds. It's not that China is pro science or India is anti Science.Even in China,If you get to know the people who are living over there,I'm afraid one might hear a different story than what is generally being projected.I'm not trying to diminish the endeavours of the chinese scientists in any way but being a big country that china is and the restrictions and impositions that it holds its citizens to,I wont be surprised if such a country invests such huge amounts for development in some rewarding fields,be it for the benefit of the humanity or for its selfish purposes.Recent death of a nobel laureate,Liu Xiaobo is more pressing an example of how materialistic a government China has and how uncompromising and stubborn it acts towards anyone who might've acted against the government.

Its not just in AI research. China is also taking steps to make everything environmentally friendly  and is a leading pioneer in quantum computing research.Chinese scientists do deserve a hell lot of praise for the work they're doing in these fields but at the same time  they're(along with everyone else) giving off their rights and everything in order to do so.It's like China is that sweet spot in between a dictatorship nation that is North Korea and the rest of the world.Or may be its a bit more leaning towards the former ,but the difference is too little to notice.

Might be wrong but thats my understanding of China from things I've observed.Been curious about everything China ever since I heard of their successful implementation of population control measures and their support for scientific research.Was quite fond of it too at the beginning.But with censorship,mandatory ""nationalism"",rot in hell cause you said the government sucks - Nah man,lets joke about scrodinger's bhai. Before you get a pro-science government, you need a pro-science population.   
  
Science education in India sucks.  
Who teaches science in the schools and colleges in India? Mostly people who could not manage to do anything.  
China on the other hand, pays PhDs (from the US and Europe) silicon valley level absolute wages to teach their students.  
   
Even on r/india/, with a more educated sample, there are almost no  posts even remotely related to science/application of science to policy/etc.   
The only time we are interested in science is when it comes to bragging and feeling good about it. (ISRO launched 100 satellites! India is Great!)  Essentially, we like (that too, sometimes) the results of science, not science itself.   Indians with their poverty, backwardness, majoritarianism democracy where religions and dogmas dominate the society. Ffs we have all sorts of religions of the world man. Keep them in your fucking house. Having a communist government which had educated people at the helm. If Nehru and his contemporaries had ruled in a similar government they wouldn't have required people to get more and more illiterate to save their own positions of power. We had some of the greatest minds pre-independance. Most of them were educated outside and would have excelled in setting an efficient Constitution irrespective of Ideologies. Choosing Democracy only led to the populace dumber and dumber, and within a few decades the same people started ruling the subsequent governments. All parties in a democracy benefit from people's illiteracy. People are nothing but human resource to them. And then much later Capitalism arrived which let even third party groups to tap into this resource. We were a poor country during independance and we needed some form of autocracy or fascism(led by educated people) then to propel us towards a direction. 

As a poor country with democracy, we were destined to reach a shitty fascist government sometime. Turkey is a good example of what is to come. 

Ask yourself this, how much do you and I know about science, history or geography. Do we really deserve to vote on those matters without knowing much about them. Its impossible for people to know every field and that makes us vote based on ignorant opinions. In a fair world, geologists and environmentalists would vote for people to head the climate ministry, not vote for who to lead the law ministry. And China actually has that system where only qualified people have a say on relevant ministries. 

People who think astrology and ayurveda are science will vote for that type of party. And that party has no incentive to teach real science because that will remove them from power. In democracy, parties compete between themselves to stay in power. In Communism, party competes with world powers. US and the West in general are so advanced to begin with that they don't have to compete. That's why democracy works for them.

To those talking about ISRO funding and what not they are flourishing only because of our IAS administrators. Civil Service is the saving grace of our country. Add to that ISRO gained huge PR before BJP came to power and BJP can't underfund it now. All our MoUs with other countries are solely there because of our administrators not our netas. Edit: In the end what matters is whether the people are happy and the country is developing or not. China succeeds in both even though their citizens don't vote. Chinese really care about their country. Indians are too narrow minded and short-sighted in their thoughts and actions. Indians and specially the Indian political class only thinks about themselves and their families. Ideology. The governing party knows that the results will not be seen in their term, so they don't give a fuck. The next one comes, and thinks the same. And the cycle of stupidity continues. Democracy It's because they can make more money by investing in technology and other sciences. Also, being a totalitarian state helps. You are talking about a country and its politics that shuns religion versus one whose political parties thrive on it. we will get AI course in our univ when Mukesh bai decides so. face it fellow Indian's you live in an oligarchy, which is fast turning into a monarchy. elections, courts, executive all exist only to give a vision of credibility to this oligarchy.  In China, it is prohibited to be religious and hold an office in the government.  Good question my friend. IMO, it comes down to power. Without offending anyone, reality is half of our country thinks, talks and acts like they just climbed down from trees few years ago and reasoning with them on a technical foot is a daunting task. However, you can control them for years by taking them back in time with gaumutra and all other horseshit. Should our lawyer enforcement and political system made the leaders accountable (at least question) for their performance before elections, you would see leaders campaigning for science. Alas, it's easier to keep the dumbfucks busy with meat, militants and intolerance with a clear path to victory. Sad to see our country lose momentum! 

I'm heading to a bar, enough of this shit for today! China is more anti-lgbt than India, I don't see how that's pro science. It's only pro science when it comes to making itself more powerful. Genetic/cultural capital and an aggressive attitude almost on a war footing (or the lack thereof). Our democracy and modern culture is geared towards redistribution, appeasement, populism and egalitarianism while their's is towards building a powerful state and nation. Indian government now seems to feel investing in science is not important and does not deserve much investment. The government funding agencies for PhDs have reduced the number of scholarships and even some institutes have increased the fees for PhD students. Also funding to research labs have also reduced and so rate of research works have slowed down. I think the strain of anti intellectualism flows from the top. when people have been pollsters and pracharaks all their life they have no idea what it takes to build a strong country and how changes in technology effect the economy. The hardwork is better than harvard cry goes around. 

look at other progressive leaders like Chandrababu naidu and AK. The investment in education and health is going to help multiple generations of their constituents.  Because India wants to become a vishwaguru Because people who are in control are busy to think how to be in power for another year rather than doing something.  
Developed a Krishna themed park rather than a science exhibition. Strangely India has gone backwards. In the past we build ISRO ,IIT's , thorium based nuclear power program.

Just because research not happening in some advanced topics like AI, don't think it's not happening in India at all. Recently my college (one of the NIT) developed technology to make sand from flyash with just 40lakhs grant.

I agree that research spending in India is abysmal. Please don't make blanket assumptions. Because china is not burdened by muslims

How soon will some bhakt make this connection? Because in India AI stands for Akhand India. Religion India is kulcha approved science , ayurvada Religion. People get the government they deserve. Someone's already flagged you as an anti-national. The thing that baffles me is that China with 1000+characters has a higher literacy rate than India with our mere 46. Wtf is that. How could  so many successive  govts across parties be so lazy? Raising literacy in India shouldn't  be THAT hard. Well it's not really true that we have an anti-science government. India has all sorts of people and perceptions, and the same is reflected in our technological developments and their awareness. Only people who are involved in the science and technology field understand the great progress India is making, while those that are not involved think we are wasting time with ayurveda/gomutra etc.

 First and foremost reason is to see how long these countries have been in existence. India was unified relatively very late in 1947 however China has been unified for a long period of time under Ming, Qing etc. rule. However India is just a collection of 500 or so princely States and the infighting and distrust between these stats even now has undermined central rule and country is quite diverse in nature. However China is relatively uniform with same language being spoken in entire country and same religion, beliefs etc. This inturn reduces central workload and this greatly increases its productivity.

China is a communist country. You never know who becomes the president. However if a good person becomes the president he has far greater powers to enact reforms and China has been lucky with that. Also any form of student is severely crushed and people are killed for opposing current regime. Compare that to us, no one gives a damn on what you do. Recently a Chinese noble prize winner died in prison due to lack of proper medication. He was in prison for opposing the rule. There are numerous cases. See what they had done in 1999. I feel lucky to be in Democratic country.

Continuation of above point, due to communist country they punishment any criminals be it on corruption, murder etc. by death. Compare that to us where even if deadly terrorists are hanged, people go streets opposing the government. The point I want to make is they have strict rules and implementation is strict. So if any rules are enacted you just expect majority of population to follow it but that's not the case here. The amount of hate Modi gets here, if it were China randia, by now, must have reached 0 subscribers. Mind you Google and Facebook are banned there. Domestic companies are heavily preferred and given special privileges there. Not here, no one recognizes or heritage. Chinese is spoken everywhere around the country and is there native language. But we are always shameful while talking in Hindi Infront of strangers. I think we should accept Hindi as our national heritage alongside with our mother tongue.

China has been historically dominating the world. Had it not been the decision of some rule to stop building ships we might have been seeing China as the great world power. Great emphasis on education, art, literature has always been there in China. Trade routes were so improved and important that Europeans majority of import came from China and Magellan and his team went on voyage just to discover shorter path to China. India has never been a global power before. It's always been regional power struggle here. They promote win-win there, we promote win-lose here. Half of our energy is spent in trying to sabotage others. 

Mindset also plays a role. Everyone here is engineer or doctor and anything other is just not accepted. However that's isn't the case there. Research, sports, business are just as lucrative options as any other option. 

 

 Cause China is a communist country..public opinion dont matter there..India is doing way better than them in pharma, aerospace and information technology...China wants to seize the opportunity to make it self look big..but they will face worse recession. Then america Answer the 8 letter word : Hinduism. Pretty certain India is progressive in the field of science, even more than the US currently. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution

you just need to whack the religion out of society, downside is society with no moral values China has invested a lot on STEM education. The number of publications coming out of China is more than 3x compared to India. [reference](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?year=2016). Anecdotally, the number of Chinese PhDs working in research labs of Silicon Valleys companies is 3 times that of Indian PhDs. Just one damn difference

That's why Smriti Irani is HRD minister instead of Yashwant Sinha or some qualified politician.

These stooges report direct to RSS and have regular meetings with people from RSS to give them progress cards and take directions from them.

Systematically all organisations have been taken over :

1. IITs (Baba Ramdev incident in IIT Delhi)
2. CBSE(Dinanath batra)
3. Censor board
4. History research grants commission
5. NSD
6. FTII
    and many others.

The most worrying part in all of this they have agendas for ""Science and Technology"" is part of their agenda.

Just read this article published in Nature:

http://www.dailyo.in/technology/narendra-modi-nature-journal-science-csir-madhukar-garg-icmr-greenpeace-biotech-space-research/story/1/3726.html

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Four-top-scientific-institutes-have-been-headless-for-months/articleshow/46649366.cms

To further their ""patriotism and hinduism"" agenda it means they need money and this is coming from budget cuts for research endeavours.

If somebody doesn't respect the international peer reviewed version of science & technology by calling it ""westernized"" then India will definitely fall behind others when budget cuts are made and research output is thought of as bogus ""westernized"" research. This can be seen by the fact that for the history research grants commission a person without one peer reviewed paper was made head.

Even highly patriotic countries with language barriers like Japan, South Korea and China believe in the international science system. 

If we go down this road further one has to believe that we will produce less and less scientific output and become like Pakistan or the middle east in terms of science and technology. kuch ni hoga. That's it. I'm outta here. I am against Indian Culture because these are the proponents of Arjuna as a great warrior and Drona as a great student. Mahabali was a just ruler and all people were without caste or creed yet he was banished to pathala because he dared challenge the Aryans. Actually, Ekalavya was better than Arjuna and Drona and we should have named awards after him. Indian Culture encouraged giving girls to sexual slavery in temples and It was Amy Carmichael who rescued them. Yet not a single university is named after her. Ida Scudder was a great soul yet no one in India has recognized her efforts in bringing about CMC vellore. BOth Ida and Amy were foreign Christian Missionaries and because of that the Indian society has ostracized them. Shame on this Indian Society. I want Modi's BJP and Congress to recognize this and give Bharat Ratna to both Ida Scudder and Amy Carmichael. I am a low caste and I would like to thank Indian Society for calling me a melecha because I eat beef and pork. to cleanse western cullture we have to throw away the atomic knowledge gained from westerners like James Chadwick and  Thomson. Besides this RSS people want to live in 13 th century  So they are going to ban Idol worshiping and arraigned marriages, English language and computers ?  Wouldn't this be cause problems to his Make-in-India plan? Every time we vote, we get idiots. Elections are guaranteed to give us idiots. Why vote? ""So does western culture also include the intense consumerism driven by neo-liberal economics? The same consumerism which is destroying the environment, driving inequality and creating more slave labor everyday?""

""Oh no, that we love about the west, we just mean rap music""  What else would you expect from an illiterate idiot who did not even pass 10th standard? This country of idiots deserves this. My children will not be growing up in this shit-hole. What a generic piece of crap is this. OP paka mat yaar  Except for hedonism and embracing promiscuity as the norm ,I feel western culture is just inherently superior. So they are going to ban Idol worshiping and arraigned marriages, English language and computers ?  Wrong priorities.

The only thing they should do is to remove English and reinstate Sanskrit as the lingua franca of India. And remove the Congi pro-British propaganda still being taught in schools.

Also, haters please note - there is a big difference between Lingua Franca and Majority Language. Two completely different concepts. Lingua franca is what you use when you converse with someone who doesn't understand your mother tongue (like many Indians use English today to speak to each other, Europeans used French earlier, etc.), majority language is just the language that becomes widespread and is spoken by a lot of people.

What I want is Sanskrit to replace English as the means of conversation between people from Indian states and language zones.",2015-09-09 19:53:41

**Childhood in my Hood, Spider-Man and INS DEGA**

As you can see, I am from Vizag. I was brought up and still live in the middle of an Industrial-Estate. My entire childhood revolved around [all sort of machines]( https://imgur.com/a/EdN3Xvj), machinery and welding sparks coming from the never ending fabrication works that went on in the hood. This sort of environment made me a naturally curious kid thanks to my dad and Uncle who both hold a Diploma in Mechanical Engineer for choosing the right neighbourhood. All my questions regarding these machines were nicely answered by my father and that in turn made me more interested in how things worked. This got a boost when I first met [*Spider-Man* and his amazing friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0FJNBRP8P0). This show and other Sider-Man shows had a huge impact on me, so much so that I used to play with common house spiders in hopes that its bite would turn me into a Spider-Man. Thanks to Universe, venomous spiders are not that common in a typical Urban Indian household I guess, I’m still alive and well. Besides that stupidity, Spider-Man being a student of science and using science to solve problems or for fighting villains made me interested in sciences and I started to pay attention in classes and made me question and think about things in universe and nature. This helped me have good foundation in Maths and General Sciences. 

On the other hand, our neighbourhood is in the close vicinity of a Naval Airport, INS DEGA. This helped me develop a love for things that fly. Our Neighbourhood used to be perfectly aligned with the runway path of the airport, this gave me really up close view of the planes touching down and taking off of the airport. Being a Defense airport there were special aircrafts in addition to the commercial ones. Navy Week was and still is the best season for some flight watching. At the age of 11, this interest in flying things pushed me to apply the science I learnt in school to make an object that fly with the help of DC motors it failed, of course. But that failure has set the path which I would follow in my higher studies. My father introduced me to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who has been a huge inspiration. I may not know the name of the degree but I decided to study the science of flight and how to build things that fly. That was the idea of a child. 

**Finding an admission for Undergrad, IITM- Shaastra 07 & 08, Job Hunt & Masters in UK**

I was good theoretically but competitive exams are not my thing. I knew, I wouldn’t succeed neither in JEE nor AIEEE so any dreams of doing Aerospace/Aeronautical Engineering were smashed, my parents are kind enough to not force me into that machinery and left me to my choice for EAMCET. I just have to get a Mechanical Engineering seat in Andhra University or GITAM. That’s good enough for me because, Mechanical engineering also covers the science of flight and these two are the best engineering schools of my city and I don’t have to leave town if got an admit. 

So I found myself in GITAM, it has been a fun ride there. I always loved hands on jobs since I am a kid. I love to build something or do something with my hands. In second year of undergrad I attended Shaastra’ 07 at IIT MADRAS and it changed my outlook on engineering as a whole. I was awed by the students who built and gave a demo of the [VTOL flight built by them, Team YU-FLY?]( https://imgur.com/a/jj7DiUk) It was the coolest thing I saw. It was when I started taking an interest in research and technological developments in my field and in general. Target was set to Shaastra 08, me and my childhood friends made a contraption built by our own hands using a lot of Jugaad and tools found from the hood. Have a look here [GIF 1]( https://gfycat.com/KnobbyCompetentBear), [GIF 2]( https://gfycat.com/ImperturbableDefenselessIberianmidwifetoad). That was the demo video we sent in with the abstract. We are the Mighty mavericks but we got of Lots of weak links in the plan and it worked only partially. This set the stage for my participation in a series of technical events that I would attend over the last two years of my Undergrad. 

My communication skills were really bad by the end of Undergrad and this meant I wasn’t doing good in the Campus Interviews. I only wanted to join a core company and I couldn’t find any. I did the 5 day assessment for technical engineer post in IAF but didn’t make that list too. Couldn’t get a good rank in GATE. But found myself an admission at a really good Mechanical Engineering School in UK. Education Loan was the only way I could afford this and my parents had to put our house on the line to get a loan. EDWISE has given me immigration support free of cost as I secured my own admission. Went to UK and finished my degree, visited London twice and returned home. That’s it. I did not make much contact with the life in UK, its land and its culture. I was limited by time and money. But with the help of High-speed internet, I did learn a lot about world, science and technology, history and was introduced to reddit, student guilds, game of thrones and a whole lot of popular culture through university life. This helped with my English and subsequently my communication skills.

**Shock after returning home**

After finishing the degree, I returned home only to find that the degree I just received is not valid in India. Even a private engineering college didn’t want to hire me as a lecturer because my degree is not considered a Master’s Degree. That was a huge blow to me. I had to look for opportunities abroad again. Thanks to my thesis supervisor in UK, a well-known name in his field, gave me a good recommendation letter which helped me secure a full scholarship to do doctoral research in Australia. I was so happy and my parents were really proud of me.

**My way Down Under and How life changed there: RA Job, Research and Cooking**

I never thought I’d end up in Australia of all places. I went there with no expectations and the first few months have been the most difficult months. Then I made friends at student housing, who pushed me to apply for RA position and that changed a lot of things. I got the position and during my term I would be promoted to a senior RA and would organize the best parties and events over the next couple of years. This gave me a huge exposure to Aussie, International students and cultures from around the world. I had to be outgoing for the job so I became an outgoing person. [My love for cooking, adventure, camping and off road driving]( https://imgur.com/a/w6k2kIk) helped me go to some of the remote parts of Australia and make some amazing friends along the way. People around me at uni and housing were mostly younger than me, were not judgemental at all and I could do what I want without fear of judgement. I was earning good money while having the best time of my life and cleared my education loan in no time. [Perfect song to describe my time down under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpjvJdomfM) 

My research on the other hand was not going as expected. I am a hands-on person and I always enjoyed experimental work rather than simulations or numerical work. My research problem has been changed by supervisor from being heavily based on experiments to one that was half cooked right from the beginning which consisted mostly of Numerical work and only some namesake validation by experimental work. On top of that one of supervisor who is supposed to help me with Numerical work has moved to another university in another country all together and I was left with a supervisor who is Experimental guy guiding me on numerical work. From there it was a downward spiral and I ended up losing interest in the research I was doing. I produced two papers which in my opinion are not really great. 

On a parallel, I was doing really well as a RA, was cooking and trying some amazing recipes to whole lot of people from around the world and at one point [I cooked Indian food entirely made from scratch for the entire student village of 300 students](https://imgur.com/a/NqswIa9). Since I was a kid, I loved cooking and it was a life-long dream to own a restaurant someday and this idea was there in the back of my head all the time. And when it came to point where I can no longer continue my research work due to various reasons and I had to make a decision to change my line of work. It wasn’t easy, I had to consider so many things into account and had to find the confidence that I can cook commercially. 

**First Job in a Commercial Kitchen and How I found myself in a Road trip**

So I went searching for a job in a commercial Kitchen. After a lot of failed attempts, I went door to door along a popular coffee strip giving out [my new culinary resume](https://imgur.com/a/xVMIt9s) which I had to make up using the things I did so far. I got a call back from a Chef who loved my resume, my passion for the craft of cooking and gave me a job in his kitchen. Being the only computer literate among the staff I got to know the ropes of making stock lists, recipe cards, the numbers behind making a menu and running a commercial kitchen basically /r/kitchenconfidential. This gave me the confidence I needed. 

I rented a big motorcycle above 700CC which I always wanted to drive and just left for a drive. I covered 1400 KM in next two days along the southwest corner of Australia. This journey gave me the opportunity be with myself, think about myself and helped me come to a decision on so many things I wanted to do in life. The trip was really dangerous, I was driving 130-120 KMPH because I only rented the bike for two days and wanted to make the most out of it, I cannot lose sight of the road ahead because if I hit a kangaroo or things crossing the roads I’d crash at high speed and before I know it I’d be dead as Australia being so huge it would take hours for someone to notice me or get me to help. This fear for life made me so vigilant, self-aware and made me concentrate on the road like I never did before and that too hours on end. I was a different person at the end of this trip. I am not even exaggerating on this one. I felt like I conquered all my fears in life.

It was clear to me; I just had to do what makes me happy. I quit my research, quit the job in the kitchen and was finally on my way back home with the most daunting task ahead,  telling my parents about it, convincing them to help me start a Food Truck and to believe in my dream. After all is said and done, they still don’t get why I am doing this but decided to support my cause. 

**My Friend**

I could not do this alone; I needed a partner to do this with. The first person I got in mind was my lifelong friend. We went to same school since kindergarten and grew up together in the same neighbourhood and in a way we see thing uniquely in our own ways. He was not a brilliant student in class but he was the best when it comes to real world, he is creative, he can see things which no one else can in places nobody else even looks. He is brave and always helped me with my phobia for dogs; he has been a huge support in my life. I spoke to him regarding this and he immediately wanted to join me. He quit his job in Mumbai and came back to our city. He has his share of troubles at home, more than me and for that I really admire him for believing in my dream and to make this decision to join me on this journey.  

**Straight Outta Vizag**
	
I named our little venture Straight Outta Vizag because I truly believe this city has shaped my life so much, in a way it defines me and for that I love my city like how Peter Parker loves his city, New York. Although we are not the webbed vigilante we too try to do some good in our city. For our first socio-event, thanks to my sister and Good Universe, a NGO, [we organised an awareness campaign on women’s health in our neighbourhood](https://imgur.com/a/uKaRy2d) and it was a grand success. 

We started operations with this [Menu](https://imgur.com/a/WIlbGXU) and was getting a  good response. Then, Kerala floods happened so we decided to donate our earnings during this run towards the Kerala flood relief activities as you can see from our post history.

**Cold hands of the City governing bodies**

No matter how good our intentions are, we are not welcomed in the city. Before going on road, we went to various government offices like, Food safety and standards, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation- GVMC and its Public Health wing, City Police and Fire Department to get permission according to this [Notification by Hyderabad City Police](http://www.ctp.gov.in/PressNote/NotificationFoodCourtVehiclePermission.pdf), I found online. It appears so that, none of the people I met have no idea if such a regulation existed in my City, Vizag. No one official has given us direction with this regard. No one has responded to us properly, most of the people claim that no one has come to them like us, asking permission to put up a food truck and that they won’t allow it, mostly because they haven’t done that before. But there are lot of food trucks running in the city. 

[I submitted a letter to the Commissioner, GVMC]( https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) in May but got no response even after all these months so we started operations with only a FSSAI license in hand. Where ever we go Police or the GVMC personnel has asked us to remove the truck. Why are other trucks allowed then? Later I learned that other food truck people formed into Unions area-wise and are running things according to their made up rules within the area like a “dhandha”. Why do I have to join a union of a particular place or all the places if I intend to set-up my truck?

**More Social Activism**

During the month of August 2018, we had rains for a couple of days and our street got flooded due to improper storm drains. We have had this issue for ages and our colony people have approached the municipality but nothing was done. In lieu of this, we brought it to the notice of [GVMC commissioner through an open letter](https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) on our facebook and twitter profiles, which talks not just about our problems in the hood but also other problems that I have seen in my city. This time we got a response but I did not mention my problems with the permits because it didn’t seem right to plug the same with problems in the hood and my city. 

GVMC responded promptly and started the restoration of storm drain works in September and finished the work during the second week of November. Due to these works happening we had to put a comma to our operations and resumed our work during third week of November. 

**What happened after we are back on road…**

This time we wanted to try a healthy breakfast menu and we set up shop on the way between VUDA Park and YSR statue Roundabout on the beach road. We were asked to vacate the place by an Assistant City Planning officer from GVMC Zone II. The next day we moved to parking in front of YMCA on beach road and two days later, this time, a sanitation inspector warns us not to put up the truck and it will be seized if we do so again. So we removed the truck and went to meet the GVMC Zone-II commissioner, Mr. Palli Nallanayya. Here’s how our interaction went by: 

Me n My friend walk into commissioner’s room who appeared to be in a staff meeting. 

Me – ‘trying to hand him the letter we already submitted to GVMC’-- utters the words: “Sir, memu food truck okati start chesam mee...” “Sir, we are starting a food truck…”
He cut me off there and with a growing frown on his face he just utters the word “ivvamu”... “Alantivi ivvamu ma zone Lo” “Stop it there, we will not give you a permit. We don’t do this sort of thing in our Zone.”

Looking at his body language and the way he didn’t even bother to hear what we have to say made me sick and we left the room. 

Because of these obstacles we are now without a proper location for our truck. Many have suggested me ways to get a contact in GVMC who knows “how to get things done” But I do not want to go that route because it is not the right way to do it and as stupid as I am I will fight for what is right and we are planning to meet the commissioner regarding this and File a RTI with GVMC and City Police regarding what they know about already existing food trucks. Meanwhile, we found some gigs with adventure agencies and started arranging food for trekking and camping events in our beautiful and untapped eastern ghats.  We also cater to small parties, family gatherings, speciality events, college get-togethers and many more. We met some amazing people along the way, particularly youngsters who seem to respect and admire what we are trying to do which in turn gave us energy to continue on our journey. We intend to bring cooking and the joy of making food closer to our patrons and give them a well-rounded dining experience wherever they choose to eat.  

Our city has so much to offer in terms of tourism. Our tourism potential is not fully tapped into and we want to promote our city tourism which will help create jobs in the local communities. I cordially invite any and all off you folks that love a good beach or a view from a hill, come visit our city, Vizag. If you choose to hire us we can take you around and accompany you with good food and present you with some amazing views that are unique to our city and it’s geography. As the songs goes...

I’m sharing this with the reddit community because it is a unique platform compared to other social networking sites and the people, stories from reddit have inspired me a lot and helped me develop as person. And by sharing this I would like inform the community about us and hope that our story may inspire someone else in realizing their own dreams. Also, to reach out to a lot of people who barely know about our City in terms of a travel destination and to reach out artists, content creators, travel bloggers and to collaborate with anyone who is interested in enjoying good food and nature. Do have a look at us, know about us and if possible inform your friends about us. See you on the road.

The best book I ever read, find the audio book is possible Try Marcus Aurelius's Meditations it's an amazing book. If you want to start with a light read you could start with Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Also checkout r/books.  You might find the book. ""**You Are Not So Smart**"" interesting. It's about the common mistakes we make in assuming things daily. It deals with the psychology of some of the biases we have, and is very easy to read. 

Keep in mind that although very interesting it's also at a very basic level. It should be your beginner's book to understanding common psychology, and not one to make you an expert.  Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond; The Tipping Point; Design of Everyday Things; The Intelligent Investor; The Story of Philosophy; Freakonomics; The Goal; The God Illusion; The Third Chimpanzee; anything by Noam Chomsky; 

Don't give up fiction entirely. Quality fiction and poetry can also help us grow and mature. Try books by Desmond Morris. An anthropologist's view on human behaviour. Some of my favorites -

Science/Technology,One way India could reform it's education,54,64aybl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/64aybl/one_way_india_could_reform_its_education/,10,"This is a throwaway here.I was reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4lwe05/what_are_the_best_ways_to_reform_education/) thread and came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4lwe05/what_are_the_best_ways_to_reform_education/d3qy34q/) post.

It's truly mind-blowing what OP has suggested.

Basically, this model has been there since 19th century and it was used to discipline kids and make them obedience.There has been no change ever since.Even though literacy rates of the west are higher,the quality of education has made many students drop out because it doesn't promote any creativity or critical thinking.The side effects of this are depression,ADHD and living unproductive life,of course.

What do you think of the solution they suggested?Do you want to add something to solution?

",edu_not_found," It boils down to the high expectations parents force on their wards. Often times it is about projecting their shortcomings on their children - 'Hey I wasn't able to crack this engineering\medicine course, I hope my child does it' So even without understanding what their child wants they go about forcing them to become who they were unable to be!

Although I agree that math and science is not the sole criteria for measuring a kid, I do believe we need it in our lives to understand things around us - what we can do is make it interesting in the lower standards, like a game, so that students don't feel it as a chore. My parents used this method and I found myself engaged in math & science from a very young age.

Even though US follows the Prussian model, they give a whole variety of other things for the child to choose from to help him/her identify their core competency. This is lacking in India though - athough there's a marked change recently albeit only for those who can afford it. The rest, as you pointed out, go through the 'industrial belt process' and come out as packaged cans unable to apply their minds critically let alone use what's stuffed inside! tldr: [Ken Robinson: Do schools kill creativity?](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity) That post is really a gem of a discovery OP!

What the post is suggesting is somewhat similar to Rabindranath Tagore's Shantiniketan Academy isn't it? I once an interview with Amartya Sen about how the eclectic environment of Shantiniketan shaped his mind, I've always been interested in the model of 'open', 'interest based' learning. Yes, some things are necessary and have to be compulsory - such as arithmetic and language, even if children are not interested in them.

But all other disciplines should be learned in a sort of mixed way. For example, why separate History and Literature? Why not study the great texts of the past to study about past society and learn the intricacies of great literature? I've always thought this would be an interesting approach. One could do the same for geography, learn stories from different places, then discuss the environment in which they take place.

Science should be more story based too, linked into history and literature, about how human discovered more and more about the world, leading to scientific revolution and the world of today.

All this can only happen when school occurs in a more relaxed atmosphere. I like the idea of not having rows, perhaps we should have more garden based learning, something like the Ashramas of old, with lessons and sport intermixing, with perhaps theatre and dance, singing, etc.

All this sounds too utopian, but maybe schools can start by designating one month for such kind of learning and see the results. Education needs reform though, even the most radical ideas should not be rejected out of hand. Wait the answer is not track all students using aadhar? /s Finlands made great strides in this area, look for talks by pasi sahlberg. I do not think reform is needed.
We just require better teachers.  > One way India could reform **it's** education

Science/Technology,IISc debuts in top 100 world university ranking.,140,3sj9dg,http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/education/iisc-debuts-in-top-100-world-university-ranking/article7869064.ece,42,,pradeep_sinngh," Regardless of the good news, it is hard to trust a list that gives a higher research score to NUS than MIT.  [deleted] ""Lund"" is ahead of IISc. :D Fuck yeah

PS - Always take these rankings with a pinch of salt. They are very much anglo-saxon oriented and each of them use different metrics. 
For e.g. - If you consider Munich or Berlin or Zürich, they in the Germanic tradition separate universities of basic learning and universities of technology, which the UK and US mostly don't. All of their big unis do research in and teach all disciplines. But say for .e.g in IISc or at the University of Munich, you don't do technology. That's the domain of the technical universities (Technische Hochschulen or Technische Universitäten). If you club them together, then Munich and Berlin would rank in the top 25 based on pure research output and impact. But most of these rankings also consider things like the ratio of international students and gender equality and social impact etc. 

If you want to do a good intensive Master's programme and then a PhD, choose a smaller university. The instructors are more hands-on. I studied at the Uni of Munich and except 2 professors, all the other big guys sent in their post-docs to teach. A friend of mine did her MSc in Neuroscience at the Uni of Edinburgh, and it was just 1 year and just 3 months of thesis. They hardly learnt anything general; it was way too focussed on a few particular topics. And in the same way, choose a doctoral advisor (PI) who is an up and coming star instead of a well-established professor, because the younger guy will be more hands-on because he is in line for big grants and a future Chair at a big Uni.  There was another ranking a few weeks back where the IITs were ranked at 600 right? So is this another ranking? Thanks in advance for clarifying.  IISc: 19 : 81 Female:Male Ratio [deleted] And this institute had to bend over because of ego of the current government. It's a shame that such nice institutes cannot freely decide how they want to teach. The Indian Institute of Science Bangalore is the first Indian university to enter the list.

He said if there were unsubstantiated claims in the book Bharatiya Vidya Saar, to be taught under this course, it would be reviewed by a committee.

.

>He further said students could undertake projects on ancient science and technology and pursue further research in these subjects. “**The whole problem is that there was a big gap between the achievements in ancient science and technology and today. Lot of things are lost. How do we even recreate, if we don’t even do experiments and reject, which is not confirmable and accept only confirmable.** Accepting or rejecting everything lock stock barrel is what is unscientific in opinion,” Sahasrabudhe said in the email.

So I guess his stance is that instead of focusing expanding on the research done today, students should spend time verifying whatever is claimed in the Vedas.

Science/Technology,"Digital Colonisation: the fight for India's soul, and for the rest of the world, begins with individual privacy online. It's time to fight back against Silicon Valley. But... how?",3,at9hy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/at9hy3/digital_colonisation_the_fight_for_indias_soul/,4,"Next to Aadhaar, Facebook may be the greatest modern threat against privacy. How do we fight back and keep Facebook from colonising India?

> ""The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)""

Have you noticed? Whenever someone says ""you're being **too political**"", it usually means ""you've mentioned a group of people I don't care about"".

Or **they gaslight you** -- saying you're ""crazy"" for not being white, male, straight, or ""American"" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined ""moral purity"".

**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley's social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. ""Them"" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.

# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**

This is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt ""free speech"". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like ""diversity is the problem"", ""don't shove _your diversity_ in my face"". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.

> Here's an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it's ""just science"" and ""knowledge wants to be free""? Of course not.
> 
> Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it's ""just speech"" and ""information wants to be free""? Of course not.

Now you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about ""free speech"". It's free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.

In other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn't like them. And as you'll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.

## **Aadhaar's Failure is Facebook's Success**

The question here begins with privacy.

Aadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India's citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.

In the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That's why Facebook is ""free"". It's as if Aadhaar's privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook's business plan.

For India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government's dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.

# **Facebook's Plan to Colonise India**

Starting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, ""if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we'll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost.""

Thankfully, India's regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.

## **Facebook and Bollywood**

If you've watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you'll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it's not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.

The two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.

Again in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook's messaging service (WhatsApp).

Even though Facebook's attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.

Instead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.

You may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you've seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone's smartphone. (There's even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))

# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**

Now think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).

As more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).

# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**

So how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?

We now know that [""free"" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don't care.

There needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they'd better not be too ""political"". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.

I'm working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I'd be glad to work with you, too. And if you're just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it's okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.",nibirujiii," [deleted] the real threat to user privacy is the GoI hare brained schemes (including Aadhar)  which are implemented in a  totally half assed manner  by 'geniuses' like Nandan Nilekani. First fix that.

In *India* FB is a very distant threat in comparison. You at least have the choice of using/not using FB. Large segments of the population are *compelled* to use Aadhar by an incompetent executive, by ordinance and law,  and the highest  court in the land meekly went along instead of siding with the citizens.

> * ""None of the planes has properties or capabilities of being flown; the geometries are unimaginably horrendous from the point of view of flying; and the principles of propulsion make them resist rather than assist (in) flying,"" the researchers said in their study's conclusions.They also concluded that the texts and the drawings did not correlate with each other ""even thematically"", suggesting that such claims were only figments of imagination by the author.Similarly, none of the mythological claims to high-end technologies in the ancient Indian past have found scientific basis despite various studies being conducted on the issue.The TTD has established the Centre for Veda Science Research (CVSR) for promoting research in the field and has recognised seven patasalas as 'centres of excellence' in Vedic studies to give a fillip to oral tradition of dissemination of Vedas.Eminent scientists will guide the project, but no further details were available on who they might be.The President inaugurated a new Veda Pathasala (school) set up by the TTD at I Bheemavaram village in Akiveedu Mandal of West Godavari district.The TTD has constructed I Bheemavaram Vedic School at a cost of Rs 4.7 crore.

Science/Technology,I hate summers!,11,9c4cu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9c4cu9/i_hate_summers/,21,"Disclaimer: My previous post was removed, reason looked more like an excuse and my appeal wasn't answered. Here I'm posting it again. It's about climate i promise, nations are included as relevance and examples for my arguments, not for personal attacks.
My previous [post is archived here.] (https://www.scribd.com/document/387542089/Enjoying-summers-Me-too-s)

I'm from Northern part of India, this little state once upon a time called as breadbasket of India, you guessed it, Punjab.  It might have lost its charm over the years but it's still one of the best place to live in India except one thing: The weather.  

I loathe the weather here, leave aside the first 4 weeks, it's literally a swamp for rest of the year, unbearably hot and humid. As a kid who grew up in Amritsar, I remember when i used to play in the fields outside my house in the monsoons, The fields are covered in concrete now. 

Fast-forward to today, I'm now an adult aged 19. My body has gained mass and stature of a man but what it hasn't gained is Mr. Freeze's Freeze-Ray to keep my cerebral cortex cool. Unless you stay inside an air-conditioned environment or wear some alien OptiTemp suit, you can't stop the heat from bogging down your cognitive functions. It's a fact!

Peak of human Intelligence seldom can be achieved in hot humid climates hence the IQ disparity between the inhabitants of temperate and tropical regions. 

Almost all developed nations are in the temperate zone barring Russia and North Korea (due to decades of Communist mismanagement). Tropical regions are mostly poor except for Bangalore-sized tiny nations like Abu Dhabi (Oil), Singapore (strategic sea hub location) etc.

If you compare within countries in the temperate zone, there's an intellectual divide between their northern and southern regions. Take Italy for example, Southern Italy is comparatively more corrupt and poor than Northern Italy. As such there's a clear correlation between climate and intelligence. This holds true for USA and Japan too. These are wealthy nations who can afford to run AC 24x7.

According to the Cold Winter theory by Richard Lynn,  Ancestors of Europeans and North-East Asians faced extreme winters thus higher intelligence would've evolved and those who didn't develop intellect, perished. Going by this, Eskimos should have the highest IQ on Earth which isn't the case but wait, the author has something to say about it.

    ""Lynn  (CWT, p. 144)  argued that high intelligence can  only  
    evolve in  large populations because mutations, being chance 
    events, are more  likely to occur in large populations. Arctic
    people have smaller  populations than Asians or Europeans and
    therefore mutations beneficial to intelligence did not occur.""

Well, intelligence is a complex topic and it is influenced by host of factors like genetics, culture, birth environment etc. Cold weather is beneficial for brain and yields the easiest intelligence boost without winning a genetic lottery. 

The energy required for cooling human body is greater than warming it up. Also, the brain guzzle up to 20% of total energy, since glucose is also used to regulate temperature of the brain in hot weather, less is spared for the process of cognition.

The people who ruled India for almost 200 years, the mighty British have been living on an Island where yearly day temperature is half that of India, 15C vs 31C. UV Radiation is also quite low and so is the scorching sunlight hours. Contrary to popular belief, dark winters don't cause depression. 

[For science]
Okay, these smartypants from the north aren't heatproof. Consider this scenario. If we were to put some of them on an isolated place without education, knowledge and access to any human technology in existence. Only children can be perfect subjects, So thousands of 5 to 12 years old on a big island (or a continent perhaps) in middle of the equator. They'll  explicit the same behavioral tendency of any equatorial human in the first generation itself, angry, lazy and unproductive. They'll procreate, form languages and religions, adapt to hot humid weather, they'll be too busy killing bugs and sheltering from heat, no energy for intellectual reasoning. 500-2000 years have gone by, their IQ has plummeted to new depths. It's now more comparable to Congolese. Several millennia has passed, their skin now exhibits more melanin than ever to protect them from sun. Suddenly one day, A big ship landed on their shore.

Science/Technology,Short concise interactive books for college students. Indian education system in bad shape.,4,9xldhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9xldhp/short_concise_interactive_books_for_college/,9,"I am a computer science college student from India. I found that students always complain about the education system, the poor quality of teachers and teaching methods (and I am one among them, it's awful in India at least) . At the same time some teachers also complain that students don't do any self study at all. They are always looking for shortcuts, like reading an article or some videos here and there to pass the exams .

If we think from the student point of view, it's very difficult for them to read books and get in-depth knowledge for so many subjects every semester at the same time following your passion (which is most of the time , unrelated to the courses they are taking) and taking part in extra curricular activities at college, learning cool technologies to become job ready. Hence it's actually not possible for them to sit down and read through 500 pages books for each subject, do assignments honestly .

I have an idea to solve this problem. If we can develop short (around 100 pages) books for every subject , which are interesting to read and at the same time give students a overall view of the subject to pass the exam. This will help them get a complete picture rather than the fragmented knowledge they get from internet , which is mostly pointless. Through a collaborative platform online , we can get this book developed by the best people in the community and make it available for everyone to read for free.

This is my idea in very brief, I would love to know your opinions and indulge in further discussion if anyone is interested.",udit003," > the fragmented knowledge they get from internet , which is mostly pointless.

Gone are the days when you could curl up with a yashwant kanetkar C++ book and feel intelligent by proxy. Learning now has to be more chaotic - going back and forth between hands-on trials and theory. Who would want to begin with syntax and shit every single time.

I don't think an offline hard copy is feasible for as fluid a field as computer science. Textbooks are a racket even in USA.

Besides, computer Science and programming is not like physics or chemistry or biology where you can really benefit from a book. In those areas, the information is much more established and unchanging (or slowly changing).

HeadFirst series of books present info in an interesting way. But it can appear childish after 1 book. An online wiki is much more helpful. Or an ebook.  Education has to evolve, like any other field. Indian education system is still somewhere in the 70's. Absolute disregard for technology and still relying on dictation+ rote learning instead of providing a platform for students to develop their own individual skillsets. 

Trying to change it from within is quite futile. I'd say get out on time, do your 5 years of boring company work, then if you still feel strongly about it, innovate. Your current idea is very shortsighted, kind of a means to an end, which is what the industry terms ""a hack"".  You are relying on a non-existent community to collaborate and contribute to something, for which they have no motivation or incentive. 

Why not start a class forum or maybe a discord/slack group instead? Create a community on that, and let it grow over a semester. Recruit the people who are active there and think of a better solution. Sounds intriguing but hardly anything worthwhile can be covered in 100 pages, it won't be any different from a really good set of notes. The best books/teachers in my opinion explore the basics very deeply, they explore the shortcomings of previous theorems/algorithms/models leading to advanced theorems/algorithms/models.

Your qualms with the education system do hold true but don't just worry about clearing exams, find a subject area you are really interested in, explore and build an expertise around that.

If you could create a community driven platform where subject experts agree to mentor people looking for in-depth knowledge, that will be more valuable.",2018-11-16 19:29:18

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries.
(Image: PIB)

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries. A
memorandum of understanding for transfer of technology for India’s first
Lithium Ion (Li-ion) Battery project was signed today between CSIR’s Central
Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI), Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu and RAASI
Solar Power Pvt Ltd.

According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, the indigenous technology
of Lithium-ion cells has been developed by a group of CSIR-CECRI headed by Dr
Gopu Kumar in partnership with CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL)
New Delhi, CSIR- Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CSIR-CGCRI)
Kolkata and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) Hyderabad.

“CSIR-CECRI has set up a demo facility in Chennai to manufacture prototype
Lithium-Ion cells. It has secured global IPRs with potential to enable cost
reduction, coupled with appropriate supply chain and manufacturing technology
for mass production,” a Science and Technology Ministry release said today.

At present India depends on countries like China, Japan and South Korea for
import of Lithium Ion batteries. India imported Li-Ion batteries worth $150
million in 2017 and is one of its largest importers in the world.

Speaking after the signing of MoUs, Union Science and technology minister
Harsh Vardhan said: “Today’s development is a validation of the capabilities
of CSIR and its laboratories to meet technology in critical areas to support
our industry, besides other sectors.”

The indigenous production of Li-Ion batteries is expected to boost Prime
Minister Modi flagship programmes like generating 175 Giga Watts of clean
energy by 2022 and National Electric Mobility Mission.

“It will give tremendous boost to two flagship programmes of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi – increasing the share of Clean Energy in the energy basket by
generating 175 Giga Watts by 2022, of which 100 Giga Watts will be Solar and
the second, National Electric Mobility Mission, to switch completely to
electric vehicles by 2030,” said Harsh Vardhan.

The project, the minister said, is also in tune with PM Modi’s vision of “Make
in India” to turn the country into ” a manufacturing hub and to cut down
outflow of foreign exchange.”

As per the MoU, Raasi Group will set up Li-Ion manufacturing facility in Tamil
Nadu’s Krishnagiri district, which is close to Bengaluru. The company aims to
bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs 15,000 per KW to replace
the Lead Acid batter. The company also plans to manufacture Li-Ion battery for
solar rooftop with life span of 25 years.

“We want to bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs. 15,000/- per
KW to replace Lead Acid Battery…“We also have plans to make Lithium Ion
battery for solar roof top with life span of 25 years to make it affordable
enough to drive the Photo Voltaic segment,” Raasi Group Chairman-cum-Managing
Director C Narsimhan said.

Why Lithium-Ion batteries:

Li-Ion batteries have applications in Energy Storage System – from hearing aid
to container sized batteries to power a cluster of villages, Electric Vehicles
(2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, 4-wheeler and Bus), portable electronic sector, Grid
Storage, Telecom and Telecommunication Towers, Medical Devices, Household and
Office Power Back (UPS), Powering Robots in Processing Industry.

Lithium-ion batteries can power any electrical application without the need of
physical wires-means wireless.

Science/Technology,IT-to-Neuroscience?,5,b4fjxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4fjxb/ittoneuroscience/,0,"Hi, 

Currently I am pursuing PhD in information technology. However, my work is progressing toward neuroscience (which I found as my energy converging point). Currently, I am studying emotions. Due to IT background, I am pretty well with the coding skills and applying it for customised high end GPU based calculations on voxel wise activity given some task. Although, I always have this feeling of lack of sufficient knowledge in the field of neuroscience. Although, I am trying my best to learn as much as possible but missing a disciplinary thinking while facing a complex puzzle. Although, I find myself studying about the neuroscience stuff without any sense of exhaustion, a leap step is needed to get deeply indulged in this exciting and important domain.

As it is a transition period for me where I need to use my relatively more developed computational skills to get the sense and pleasure of getting new in-depth knowledge of the field of brain science. I am seeking for the suitable guideline which can give me a better chance to grab the domain knowledge during this transition and lead me towards disciplinary thinking over more complex problems. I am interested in further studying emotions and related disorders. The guidelines during the PhD and after the PhD both are very much needed and highly appreciated. The guidelines can include anything from intern, clinical service, research associate to any junior level fellowship. I just want to learn more about the field.",sud8233,,2019-03-23 13:40:57
Science/Technology,"Today is the Birth Anniversary of Homi Bhabha, Father of India's Nuclear Programme",347,2kr9zr,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homi_J._Bhabha,39,,agentbigman," [deleted] Happy birthday homie ..who was most likely killed by CIA :( Very few people remember this. Fucking CIA. From the Archives at TIFR (PDF) : http://www.tifr.res.in/~archives/snippets_from_the_archives.pdf Here's a good read on the history of India's Nuclear Programme - [Nucleus and Nation: Scientists, International Networks, and Power in India](http://www.amazon.com/Nucleus-Nation-Scientists-International-Networks/dp/0226019756)

From the back cover 
>In 1974 India joined the elite roster of nuclear world powers when it exploded its first nuclear bomb. But the technological progress that facilitated that feat was set in motion many decades before, as India sought both independence from the British and respect from the larger world. Over the course of the twentieth century, India metamorphosed from a marginal place to a serious hub of technological and scientific innovation. It is this tale of transformation that Robert S. Anderson recounts in Nucleus and Nation.Tracing the long institutional and individual preparations for India’s first nuclear test and its consequences, Anderson begins with the careers of India’s renowned scientists—Meghnad Saha, Shanti Bhatnagar, Homi Bhabha, and their patron Jawaharlal Nehru—in the first half of the twentieth century before focusing on the evolution of the large and complex scientific community—especially Vikram Sarabhi—in the later part of the era. By contextualizing Indian debates over nuclear power within the larger conversation about modernization and industrialization, Anderson hones in on the thorny issue of the integration of science into the framework and self-reliant ideals of Indian nationalism. In this way, Nucleus and Nation is more than a history of nuclear science and engineering and the Indian Atomic Energy Commission; it is a unique perspective on the history of Indian nationhood and the politics of its scientific community. Google, why isn't there a doodle for this occasion? The nation wants to know. I am amazed by academic lineages at times. He studied under none other than Paul Dirac!  Can we please, at least now, have a nuclear missile called ""Bhabha ji ka Thullu"" ? Fun fact: The scattering process of electron and positron(anti-electron) is called Bhabha scattering. [deleted] Salute!! its my budday too BUT SAAR I THOUGHT THE FATHER OF INDIAS NUCLEAR PROGROM WAS LORD SHIVA: THE DESTOYER.

The thing is that from the beginning of my college life, I have been depressed. All around me people have been constantly talking about job. I don't want to pursue engineering. I feel trapped and depressed. I spend time sleeping or browsing Internet to distract my mind. Instead of having a goal in my life, I'm always thinking of dying; I'm always thinking of running away. I wanted to study math(and sciences), but due to people telling me to go for the college instead of course(and also because of me not knowing the difference between science and technology), I landed up where I am. And the thing is that now I can't do anything. I'm 23 and living off my parent's money. I don't want to disappoint them. My ability to think rationally has diminished. Now I cannot concentrate for more than a few moments before getting anxious. I think I am depressed but I don't know. I want to die but I cannot. I hate myself to be born. I don't want money or job or anything. I want peace. There is nobody to help me. All people around me think I am an idiot for not thinking rationally. They all want job and money. I want to rest. Either way I'm gonna die, even if I get a job and earn money or not. Should I  run away from the college when the break starts so that nobody knows? I wish I die tonight in my sleep. For anyone getting this far, thanks for reading (I needed to open up and though that few strangers on the internet wouldn't mind me sharing something) and enjoy your life.",jopiz," Dude. You gotta do what you want. Speak to your folks and tell them about it. Running away isn’t the solution Dude running away is never the solution. Talk to your parents about the issue. I am sure they will listen to you. There are numerous other avenues you can pursue even post engineering. I believe if you have invested a substantial amount of time and money in engineering, you should at least get a degree in it. After the degree you can do MS in Mathematics  or even become a math teacher if you would like.  Talk to a career counselor if needed, I am sure it would help > I wanted to study math(and sciences), but due to people telling me to go for the college instead of course(and also because of me not knowing the difference between science and technology) I wanted to study math(and sciences), but due to people telling me to go for the college instead of course(and also because of me not knowing the difference between science and technology)

Which branch you’re in? You can still move to pure sciences, lot of people have done it. For example, if you are in CS/IT, you can go for a masters in Statistics or Applied mathematics or Financial mathematics. All have good scope. Stats or applied maths will get you a great career in data science. Financial mathematics can get you a career in HFT firms or others as Quantitative Analyst but it’s tough to get into, you have to be really good at your maths.

If you are in other branches also, these fields are open. Applied physics is also good for niche careers especially if you have mech background.

The whole point is, there’s always something if you don’t give up. Your parents can provide you direction. Give it a try ",2018-11-26 04:18:24

https://audioboom.com/channel/livemint Would be really helpful if you can add whether the primary language is Hindi or English. Thanks! Can anyone recommend some good podcast apps? Wao. Thanks man. [deleted] Thanks! will help in metro rides. Much appreciated, this 'll be very helpful. Thank you!  Mast re mitra..laiii bhaari I listen to all three audiomatic podcasts listed here and I think that the quality of these podcasts (research/content, clarity of thought) is very good. I highly recommend it.

OP the host's name for ""Our Last Week"" is Anuvab Pal.  thanks OP.

question to all: from this list, which would you nominate as:
1. the best purely-fact-based podcast (something like futility closet)? should not be editorialised in any way whatsoever.

2. are there any good india-centric trivia/pub quiz podcasts? (something like podquiz or good job brain) Thanks. I think you may include All India Radio podcast as well Add : simblified ! Man, I still miss Plan B Project, those guys were really funny..  Add Youtube channel of All India Radio. It has amazing content. Please do go through it - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdwm5QNss1TpY_whBkql0dw  Add Neha Dhupia's podcast on Saavn. Have really enjoyed her first season. Awesome list, thanks so much [deleted] brilliant..thanks! Also add antennapod for android and gpodder for gnome linux as apps. It would nice to have an OPML on Github. for  Thanks for the list OP. I think you missed a few podcasts offered by Saavn - Qisson ka kona is a good one amongst them The news laundry has a podcast too.  [MyindMakers](https://www.myind.net/podcasts) - Weekly political news

[BBC Love Radio](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrtsy/episodes/downloads) - weekly bollywood News  So I have Pocket Casts which I got especially for West Wing Weekly but I don't understand how do I use the app to manage all the random obscure third party podcasts?

If not, is there another app which allows me manage all podcast for Android? Manage is basically auto-download new episode and delete on completion for me.  For anyone that might give a damn about Indian basketball - a friend and I have a podcast : Hoopdarshan that has a steady but loyal listener base and we have new episodes roughly once every 2-3 weeks. Some NBA chat too if you enjoy that.

 Akar patel is a Hinduphobic buffoon, probably not a good idea including that moron here Hey, I recorded two episodes for a podcast with a friend. It's called [By The Lake](https://soundcloud.com/bythelakepodcast) and in the last two episodes we talked about AI and Mortality from the lens of pop culture with an (almost) scientific mindset. We kept in mind to not throw around technical jargons much.

Both the episodes are about an hour long. Incidentally, the first one also has a passing reference to r/India Thank you! Saved me from posting a new question!
 Not including ""The History of India"" podcast? What a shame. Probably the best Indian history podcast on the Internet.",2017-01-29 21:55:30
Science/Technology,DRDO working on Star Wars-like weapons,40,4c7z8f,http://m.timesofindia.com/india/DRDO-working-on-Star-Wars-like-weapons/articleshow/51577689.cms,23,,Abzone7," i thought they were building the death star for reals. May the force be with them funny people... OPeration Whitewash !!
For all the DRDO skeptics. That headline.  The force is strong...  Kyaa...Comedy karta hain unkil? They will handover colorful tube light in the name of light saber. Interesting. Hope they will be successful. The govt should encourage more research and development. Bas tubelight de diyo, phir sab jugaad lenge. Arun jatley saying Its a Trap! From what I have heard of them, they are barely capable of making water pistols. Weren't they studying the vedas or some shit? Oh shit! Maybe it's all true!

Seriously though, all that effort spent on lazers only to be thwarted by a fucking mirror. DRDO. Hmm. Let me check their track record.

Tejas- Which was in ""development"" for decades.

Insas rifle- Modified Israel rifle.

Rustam UAV- what is that? A card board toy plane? The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is already tom-tomming its ongoing development of a 10-kilowatt DEW against UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) like targets, with “the establishment of critical technologies of precision tracking/pointing and laser beam combination”.

---

> * New Delhi: From ""heat rays"" in H G Wells' science fiction novel 'The War of the Worlds' of 1898 to galactic super-lasers in George Lucas' continuing 'Star Wars' film saga, concentrated energy weapons have been fantasised about for long without them becoming operationally viable.But advanced militaries now think directed energy weapons (DEWs) like high-energy lasers and high-powered microwaves will become strategic game-changers in the not-too-distant a future.

> * While the US, Russia, China and others are leagues ahead in the race to develop advanced DEWs, though their actual operational deployment is still some distance away, India is also trying to make some headway towards such futuristic weapons.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is already tom-tomming its ongoing development of a 10-kilowatt DEW against UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) like targets, with ""the establishment of critical technologies of precision tracking/pointing and laser beam combination"".The ""system"" has been tested up to a range of 800 meters at its Hyderabad-based Centre for High Energy Systems and Sciences (CHESS), and was also demonstrated to the armed forces at the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory's firing range at Ramgarh (Haryana) in September last year.Development of DEWs and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons has been identified as a top-priority area in the 15-year ""technology perspective and capability roadmap"" chalked out by the defence ministry, as reported by TOI earlier.The DRDO, often criticised for huge time and cost overruns in its projects, says smaller systems like laser-based ordnance disposal of IEDs and mines, hand-held laser dazzlers to overpower armed terrorists and vehicle-mounted laser dazzlers for controlling unruly mobs have already been developed.But the real challenge will be in achieving the declared aim to develop solid-state laser DEWs for aircraft and warships, which can destroy enemy ballistic missiles in their ""boost phase itself"", somewhat akin to what is already being tested by the US.The DRDO's Laser Science & Technology Centre is working on an array of systems from ""chemical oxygen iodine lasers"" to ""high-power fiber lasers"" for st-rategic uses, which includes a 25-kilowatt laser to take on a ballistic missile du-ring its ""terminal phase"" at a distance of 5-7 km.All this has gained momentum after the government in February 2014 sanctioned Rs 115 crore for de-velopment of ""experimental technology modules for directed energy laser syst-ems"" by CHESS, with the project completion date being set for July 2017.

Science/Technology,We really need to talk about Flairs.,103,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",2017-05-15 21:21:16

Are they recruiting? This link was in r/worldnews sometimes back and people there were like, ""*we have poverty and raep issues, let's build supercomputers instead*"". What they're forgetting is that there was a time when the fourth fastest one belonged to us in 2007. Given the amount of R&D we're going to do in coming years, these things are a necessity. ab candy crush khelenge supercomputer par Are these being built just for the sake of it or are there any actual research projects that they're planning to use these for?

Science/Technology,Pride and Prejudice,92,6s6xir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6s6xir/pride_and_prejudice/,76,"I was having a beer while reading a book in the cafeteria in Deutsches Museum. A middle aged couple sat next to me. The lady said, ""Hello"".
""Hello"", I replied. The gentleman joined in, ""Studying in Munich?""
""No. Working"", I said. 
""Where you are from?""
""India"", I said. 
""Oh we are also originally from India. We live in USA. 20 years. Came here to visit our daughter and our grandchildren. We are originally from this city of that state in India"". I smiled and nodded and started speaking to them about that city in that state in India because I also lived there for 7 years. He started saying how much he misses his city and his country, being 20 long years in USA. I smiled and listened although I wanted to return to my book. Here I was sitting surrounded by the statues of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, Leibnitz and hundreds of scientists and mathematicians, the descriptions and depictions of their work in one of the best technical museums of the world containing hundreds of machines of the past, computers, ships, aircrafts, telescopes and what not and suddenly the gentleman said, ""No matter what one says, we are far ahead than them"". I was puzzled. ""What are we talking about?""

The man said, ""In shastra it is written - Everything comes from water and fire. Have you read Veda?"" and then he unfurled a shloka from Veda. I was quite amused. He then continued, ""Our Munis and Rishis have written everything about nuclear physics 5000 years back"". I interjected, ""That I would not know but I think that the contributions of the likes of Ramanujan, Bose, Raman and Chandrasekhar were enormous"". He skirted those names and said, ""I am an engineer. I have to tell you that India is at least 1000 years ahead than any country in science. One has to read Veda"" and then he fired another sloka. His wife was not getting impressed just as I was not making much sense of the sudden outpouring of Sanatan sentiments. 

I realised that it was better to move. But then he did not stop, ""You see it is a matter of what I call perspective. We knew thousands of years back what scientists here are knowing now. Chemistry, atomic physics, space everything we knew. At that time Europe was what? A dark continent. They knew nothing. We invented Zero, you know that?"" 

This is when I lost it. I asked him, ""Sir, you miss your city and your food and friends. That is quite understandable. But I do not understand why you have spent 20 years in USA and your daughter is married in Munich while you miss your country so much and you cannot stop praising it. Why don't you go and live in India? I also do not understand why you are even here when you should be in India digging Vedic spacecrafts. Why do you come to a Science and Technology museum in Germany to claim superiority on others' achievements? Indeed one can take the Indian out of India but one cannot take the India out of the Indian.""

His wife tugged at his arm before things escalated because I guess he was about to throw another salvo of slokas. They got up and left. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. It is not the ignorance that hurts so much, it is the misplaced pride that left me dumbfound and sick in my guts. ",airwolf1989," I really hate it when religious folk try to twist scientific facts just so that they can wank to their religion or kulcha and claim how superior it is to others.  Hindutava in Germany. >
indeed one can take the Indian out of india but can't take the india out of an Indian.

indeed one can take the Indian out of india but can't take the stupidity out of an Indian.

FTFY.
 I've met a couple of morons like this in the US. I swear, some NRIs who left India in the 70s and 80s are still stuck in those decades. 

I would have pretended to agree with him just to see how far he would take it. /r/thathappened
 Why are so many incredibly successful Indians such retards? Tragic. 

Also, woe-betide the countries which are deceived into believing that these kinds of people have any amount of respect for their adopted lands.  well done, sir. you could've used your middle finger sloka. I have met many people who are similar in their attitude of India is vastly superior and yet when I question them as to why they wouldn't return and instead stay outside they deflect and are not ready to provide any answers. If we were so advanced why did we fail so pathetically to stop the invaders from central Asia? Were they all supermen? 
I don't know why by NRIs seem more conservative than average Indians Ha! yet anther smartass, glib-tongued, kulcha-warrior Indian, most likely Brahmin and from New Jersey.

He must be real proud of Currywurst.

also 20 years is nothing. you could have just humored him and let it go.  Who reads Pride and Prejudice in a German museum, man? /s lol more like 1000 years behind in some cities/states. When will another asteroid hit? > ""Our Munis and Rishis have written everything about nuclear physics 5000 years back"".

Even I agree with this statement, why didn't our uncle do anything to use it? Thousands of people dying from hunger, unsanitary conditions, lack of healthcare and these morons think that we are far superior from US (or any other first world country)   I'm glad you feel are much more learned, intellectual, and cosmopolitan than a man probably twice your age who openly admitted to being homesick after decades spent in foreign societies with no hope of ever feeling like he's just another 'normal local' in either USA/Germany or a constantly changing India ever again.",2017-08-08 01:05:42

Ah. So that's why.

Interesting name. BTW why is an 'Islamic' institute of 'Science and Technology' giving MBA degrees? I have a side question - Why does Smriti Irani look constipated in all her photos? Don't give him degree... Let him do MBA again. Why blame a guy who did not want to take his hard earned degree from a fraud? I posted same article 2hrs ago.",2015-10-18 11:54:56
Science/Technology,I am planning a new digital learning initiative. I need your help.,22,8rsrvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8rsrvc/i_am_planning_a_new_digital_learning_initiative_i/,12,"I have just finished my school education in science in India, and am deeply concerned about the state of affairs. I wish to target specific areas.

Some complain that the system promotes ‘rote memorization’ and that the syllabus is ‘too theoretical’ and is not ‘practical’ or ‘linked with everyday life’.

The system is far worse than that.

In classes 1 to 10:

There is a heavy emphasis on regurgitation of memorised material.

There is too much ‘flab’ in the syllabus.

There is very less rigour in the subjects of maths and science.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to gain a comprehensive picture of a subject, but the line of questioning is such that you don’t need anything more than the textbooks.

There is not much focus given on seeing if students are capable of analysing new information and making pertinent observations.

Further questioning from the students’ side has no real outlet within the traditional syllabus.

In classes 11 and 12:

The rate at which information is to be consumed and understood increases dramatically.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to completely understand a subject BUT understanding is necessary to be able to survive the examinations.

Rote memorisation is an impediment, not an aid to success.

The line of questioning is far from direct. You need stop treating the syllabus as a body to remember, but as a set of tools in your arsenal to fix the problem. You have to generate independent results from the tools you are given.

Every piece of information in the syllabus is important and useful for examinations. There is nothing that you can’t know.

In the world of competitive exams:

You need to go well beyond the given syllabus.

You need to be able to think very creatively and come up with innovative solutions.

Emphasis is given on the ability to manipulate learnt content within extreme time constraints to solve the situation.

You can see the problem, can’t you? For the first 10 years of formal education, when they are in their most neurologically adaptive state, we expect students to have this conformist, regurgitative attitude towards academics, and then, when they are nearly adults, we expect them to have the analytical and creative problem-solving abilities of mini-Einsteins.

There are three categories of students who survive this catastrophe.

The real prodigies. These students quickly learn to move ahead of the existing syllabus and go onward. I respect and admire them.

Those whose circumstances give them a head start. This was me. I hated rote memorisation so I would do the bare minimum necessary. I’m not saying that I performed bad, academically, in classes 1 to 10. It’s just that where the others were busy memorising whole passages verbatim, I was looking at a few key words and facts and building up the rest in the exam hall. That’s the only way I kept a facade up despite a lousy work ethic. Since I was already accustomed to never memorising, it was mainly a matter of adjusting to the new rate and new depth.

Those who can work really, really hard. I admire the sheer determination of this category, and they often overlap with 1. and 2. , but many of them continue with the verbatim approach and clear the struggle by memorising every case and every type of problem possible.

We need to fix this. We need to expose students to a problem-solving based curriculum from day one. We also need to make the syllabus far less top-heavy. With just one or two more chapters in each subject every year, we could have the whole of class 1 to 10 over a couple of years earlier.

In the traditional system, I would have said that this is impossible. It needs a curriculum change, reskilling of teachers, change of public policy, bulldozing public opinion that school is becoming ‘harder’, and forcing experimental teaching and evaluation methods on schoolchildren.

In the digital world, creating an adaptive learning system for such a goal is a far less difficult challenge.

In my ‘ideal-scenario’ curriculum, I would focus on only four skills:

Critical reading: In the current scenario, learning the ‘chapters’ is given more emphasis than on checking if students can actually process new passages of information. Most students are unable to self-learn and are dependent on spoonfeeding for this reason.

Critical writing and grammar: I don’t mean the typical ‘parts-of-speech-in-detail’ grammar. I just mean being able to differentiate between correct and incorrect English grammar and being able to apply it to express new ideas. Once students can do this, they no longer have to memorise passages to answer in exams — they can construct their own sentences.

Arithmetic and geometry: Pretty self explanatory.

Logical reasoning: This is not subject-specific. It should be done in a way which is independent of any particular technical subject. In the JEE, the content is based on PCM, but they actually test us on our critical thinking and logical reasoning ability — using the subject as a medium. We don’t have to use any prerequisite subject.

I need the help of subject curriculum and testing experts, web designers, teachers, students, and anybody else who feels that they can contribute to this project.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you saw my above post, then you know what this is about.

I really, really need help from experts in both education (in both STEM and liberal arts) and technology implementation (primarily web design, UX/UI etc.)

Otherwise, I guess it is up to only me to revise 12 years of syllabus for a broken system, rewrite and execute lecture videos, come up with suitable assessments, code the adaptive assessment system, build the website, and deploy it.

All of that, assuming I already know how to do it, would take at least a year for one person to execute -- that's assuming they are working full time.

Which I can't.

And that's if I knew how to do everything by myself.

Which I don't.

What this means is that without help, this project in it's current form will be over before it even got started.

Even if you can't join the core dev team, it would be a huge step forward if you could direct me somehow to find the support I need for this project.

Thanks,

Chanakya Digital Accelerated Learning Initiative (can find me on Quora under the username ""CDALI Planner"")",plannercdali," Count me in. I'm interested!  I have a few questions for you

1) do you have funding?

2) Are you going to be doing this full time? What about your higher education?

3) you're looking at a syllabus for all 12 years right from 1st standard?

4) platform? Mobile /PC /Web Hi, 

Amazing thought and it was wonderful to read your post and so much energy flowing into improving the quality of learning in our country. What you are thinking is absolutely right, how you would want to do it may require very serious consideration. You have to be very careful to not fall into the trap of what all has already been tried in the Indian education space. 

Honestly, what I have seen in the last 8 years with most organisations and inspired individuals like you is that they take a me too approach at solving this vast education problem in India. And that's one reason why we are yet to see one single solution reach mass scale. What we need is an integrated and a partnership driven approach to solve the problem at scale. 

I will give you an example to explain this better. 

When you talk to someone who wishes to transform our education, majority start talking about developing the content. What most don't understand is that there is so much content already available in English and in several local languages, across multiple subjects and grades. However, all content development is piecemeal. Which means that there is one company building apps on Math and then there is another creating animated videos in Science. Then, there would be someone who is working on assessments. And each one of them feels that their's is the best way to educate the child. Each one of them is trying to reach the same audience, albeit individually. To make content, you need lot of time, money and resources. And once you invest so much in making content, your only approach is to monetise that content piece and all your energies are towards this only. You therefore fail to see the larger picture. 

Second issue I have observed with educationists is that we end up giving too much structure to the way a child should learn. There is no space for the child to experiment and enjoy learning. You would know that historical learning gap is one of the major challenges in rural learning. A class 5 student cannot solve basic mathematics sum of class 2. A class 6 student cannot read words that a class 3 child should. And there is no way currently by which you can bridge this gap. By over structuring the learning and making it too teacher centric, we are depriving the child to happily switch to lower grades and cover up their basics. How can we expect a child to develop life skills that will help him grow. 

When we were starting[ iDream Education](https://www.idreameducation.org) after having worked in the education space for 6 years, we took a conscious call to take an integrated approach. We took years to go through multiple content pieces available and cracked the best way to integrate them, structure them and present them to a child under one dashboard. We have built a multilingual, personalised and an adaptive learning platform that integrates multiple categories of learning content from multiple sources thereby empowering each child to choose their own style and pace of learning.  We are taking a student centric approach to learning that also makes the life of a teacher much easier. 

What we have done so far is taken an integrated approach to content and the solution. The second part of the game is to create a channel to be able to reach schools and children at the lowest cost possible. A lot of organisations take a me too approach here also. Having learnt our lesson, we have chosen to take an integrated approach to building reach as well. We are therefore partnering with NGOs, aspiring education entrepreneurs and people who already running a school service and distribution business. The key is to build a sustainable and scalable business and social impact model that build both social and commercial value for everyone in the ecosystem. I have written more about the opportunity in the space of personalised digital learning [here](http://www.idreameducation.org/blog/social-business-opportunity-personalised-digital-learning/).

While police firing led to death of one protestor there are conflicting reports on whether the woman killed was part of protesters or was she looking at the events from her verandah and was hit by a stray bullet.

>The people were protesting against killing of a militant in an encounter with police and army.
Officials said that police and army cordoned the Kharpora area of Kakapora this afternoon. “Some militants who were walking in a street fired towards the forces which were retaliated, triggering an encounter,” officials said.
“The encounter continued for two hours in which one militant was killed. However three others managed to escape from the spot,” they said.
The killed militant was identified as Adil Ahmad of Banderpora, Pulwama.
“As the encounter was on, hundreds of people from neighbouring villages staged massive protests and pelted stones on the forces in order to help the militants break the cordon,” officials said. The forces fired tear smoke shells and bullets on the protesters, killing a local boy on the spot. He was identified as Danish Farooq Mir son of Farooq Ahmad, resident of RatniporaPulwama. Danish was a student of B Tech in Islamic University of Science and Technology.

Sopore, Pulwama(especially Tral),Anantnag and old Srinagar.

Whereas areas like Kupwara, Bandipora and Poonch which see a large number of encounters/infiltration, the population is far less anti India.
Tourist areas like Gulmarg, Pahalgam also have little to no separatist activity. > the woman killed was part of protesters or **was she looking at the events from her verandah** and was hit by a stray bullet.

Looking at a gunfight from verandah? o.O Martyr!  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) This is the sad part about the Kashmir issue which most Indians are not aware of. It can be severely demotivating for soldiers and officers when Kashmiri people do not support them. India will need to engage the people of Kashmir. Every war is not fought with bullets. We need a political solution to the Kashmir issue that is within the framework of Indian constitution, and gives a feeling of self-rule and freedom to Kashmiri people. There are solutions possible: Like Scotland and England, and Ireland and England. Why not give people some more autonomy and let the Indian Army just rule the borders?  [removed] So, why don't these guys carry a couple cameras to ID these fuckers? When the people go bat-shit insane and start protesting, GoI should put that video up on Youtube or something and use social media to get the counter that it needs. 

Use social media and technology in such cases where it can be easily used. Imagine if this same scenario happened anywhere but in Kashmir. Hundreds of protestors throw stones at the army and and the police, who kill two civilians during this. This commotion allows a few anti-government militants/terrorists/whatever to get away.

Imagine if this happened in China. Or British India. Or America. Or anywhere else on the globe. It would be seen as a clear indictment of government oppression and a sign of the people's discontent with it. If you can justify shit like this, you can justify Tiananmen Square.

People have the right to govern themselves, and yes, that includes the right to live in an Islamic shithole if they want. Indians behave as if they have some ""Brown man's burden"" to bring their version of civilisation to them, when these people clearly don't want it.  [deleted]",2016-02-15 13:27:48
Science/Technology,TIL : Concept of Time Dilation theory was mentioned in ancient Hindu Texts..,16,2tj3jo,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revati,64,,zvcf," I do not think ""time runs differently on different planes of existence"" is time dilation theory. It vaguely might sound similar but it isn't. Taking specificity out of scientific theories is taking out their essence. Vague philosophizing is not science. Just like Deepak Chopra's quantum bullshit is not science. OP: this isn't talking about time dilation. That's dope. http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/dgbg.gif

and upboated for drama It's funny that all these so called miracles are discovered in the scriptures only after science has discovered it. 

These texts are vague and can be interpreted in multiple ways. I really don't think they're talking about time dilation. Time dilation has more to it that time running differently in 2 different places.  I think many people in this thread don't get the point.

Nobody is taking these texts as hard-science; Hindu philosophy is by no means a substitute for Physics. 

But it doesn't have to be scientific to be appreciated as art and literature. The fact that our ancestors were able to come up with sci-fi or this caliber is astonishing and admirable. And it certainly has a lot more to offer to mankind than some of the other religions. India is like that kid in class who can't read and write properly but has an opinion on 'Existentialism as a Humanism'.

**View: A compelling case to have Bengaluru as second Indian capital** 

 ______ 
** By Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw **** **

The recent suggestion by

RV Deshpande

, Karnataka's minister for large &amp; medium industries and infrastructure
development, that

Bengaluru

be given the status of a second capital of

India

has sparked off an interesting debate.

For a country as vast and ethnically diverse as India, I believe there is a
compelling case to create a southern capital for all the reasons that
Deshpande has outlined in his letter to the prime minister.

The concept of two capital cities is not uncommon: nearly 15 countries across
the world have multiple capitals. For instance, Bolivia, Georgia and the
Netherlands have two capitals! South Africa has three capitals — Bloemfontein,
Cape Town, and Pretoria — that house its judicial, legislative and executive
branches.

Bengaluru's strongest claim to being India's second capital lies in its status
as the country's science and technology (S&amp;T) hub. It's only our
scientific prowess that can help propel India into a higher growth orbit.

Bengaluru boasts a mature S&amp;T ecosystem, which has attracted several MNCs
to invest in the city to conduct their R&amp;D operations. The government,
industry and academia here have provided the impetus for the development of
the S&amp;T sector in terms of the availability of a scientific workforce,
world-class R&amp;D infrastructure and investor-friendly policies.

The information technology and biotechnology booms have engendered a strong
entrepreneurial culture in the city. Bengaluru is already the ""Science
Capital"", ""Startup Capital"", ""IT Capital"" and ""Biotechnology Capital"" of the
country.

By proposing it as a second capital, the intent is not to duplicate the
administrative infrastructure with overlapping jurisdictions, but rather to
have a more efficient and optimal distribution of ministries between New Delhi
and Bengaluru. It means leveraging the core competence of Bengaluru as India's
Knowledge Capital.

The city possesses the kind of intellectual capital that can drive the
evolution of forward-looking, next-generation policies that will enable India
to leapfrog to global leadership in S&amp;T. There is a strong case for
implementing over the next five years a plan to relocate the science-related
ministries from New Delhi to Bengaluru. These ministries will benefit
immensely from the scientific culture of the city. It will also help the
government in keeping its ear to the ground when formulating policies.

The success of India's space programmes is due in large measure to the
Department of Space being based in Bengaluru. Housing the ministries of
science &amp; technology and electronics &amp; information technology in
Bengaluru would throw open many new avenues for closer collaboration that can
lead to greater success of these sectors. For instance, agencies like Unique
Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), if located in Bengaluru, can
benefit immensely from the large IT ecosystem and the rising status of the
city as the data science hub of the country.

As India's Science Capital, Bengaluru can be the epicentre for pushing India
towards a more digital and formalised economy, while enabling e-governance and
participatory policy-making through the government's

Digital India

initiative. Currently, the southern states feel alienated when it comes to a
redress of issues and policymaking.

As a second centre of administrative power, Bengaluru can help ease the burden
of governance through greater expediency and efficiency.

By giving Bengaluru the status of India's second capital, not only will the
Indian government help unleash the huge potential of the country's innovative
S&amp;T prowess, it will also send out a strong signal that the South is a
very integral part of the country.

Prime minister Narendra Modi’s pledge to place India among the top three countries in the world in the field of science and technology (S&T) by 2030—announced at the Indian Science Congress in Tirupati earlier this month and reiterated at the Nobel prize exhibition in Ahmedabad this week—is a fine sentiment. But it is also a grandiose one. Getting even part-way there is going to take some doing. India performs below its potential on just about every indicator of scientific progress and achievement there is: be it the amount of public and private funding earmarked for research, the number of prestigious awards won by Indian scientists working in Indian institutions, the number of patents registered in the names of Indians or the number of articles published in well-known peer-reviewed journals.

India has a long civilizational history of scientific achievement. But today the list of Indian scientists who have won the world’s most prestigious award, the Nobel, begins and ends with C.V. Raman. The longer list of Indian-origin and Indian-born winners has 16 mentions—but that also only highlights the large-scale systemic failures that extend across institutions and manifest at all levels.

Only time will tell if the Modi government will be able to put in motion the revamp he has spoken of. But for now, there are early indicators that give us some idea of the government’s plans and priorities.

First is the government’s focus on improving science education at the school level: In Ahmedabad, Modi spoke of scientists helping develop course modules while in Tirupati, he mentioned scientific social responsibility wherein premier laboratories and research institutions could partner with nearby schools and colleges to create an environment that supports scientific education and innovation. This is well and good. But these are in the nature of vague, broad ideas, when what is needed is foundational work on the overall education system.

A human resource and development ministry report tabled in Parliament last month noted that as many as a million teaching positions in government schools across the country are lying vacant; successive status of education reports by the non-profit Pratham have highlighted how educational outcomes among Indian school students are falling at an alarming rate.

The situation in institutions of higher education is hardly any better. Elite institutions such as the IITs are the exception, and they too struggle to compete globally. In the QS World University Rankings 2016-17, only two Indian institutions ranked among the top 200 universities in the world: Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (rank 152) and Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (rank 185). Research institutions also suffer from government interference and lack of funding which, among other problems, makes them unattractive to rising talent that prefers greener pastures abroad.

The second issue that the government is focusing on is strengthening the links between S&T and industry. If done right, this could potentially bring in the resources necessary to boost Indian science. Currently, much of the funding comes from the government while private-sector investment (in the form of research and development centres, for example) is below par. Overall, despite talk since the late 1980s of increasing S&T investments from the public and private sector to 2% of GDP (gross domestic product), the figure still hovers at around 0.9%. In comparison, South Korea leads the race, investing 3% of its GDP in S&T, while Japan follows close behind.

Another example is tiny Israel, which has not only nurtured a flourishing S&T ecosystem but leveraged its security challenges to build a robust defence industry. In India, it will be interesting to see if the Modi government’s flagship scheme to boost domestic manufacturing and its consequent efforts to woo foreign capital (specifically in defence) can do something similar.

Against this backdrop, it was perhaps in the fitness of things that the Nobel exhibition, which brought nine Nobel laureates on one platform in Ahmedabad, was organized in association with an investment summit to underline how science, technology and innovation hold the key to enterprise and entrepreneurship. The event is part of the larger Nobel Prize Series—and can be seen as part of the government’s larger effort to make science more glamorous. But talk is cheap. If there is to be real progress, it will need unglamorous, ground-level work. Fetishizing the Nobel as an end in itself—as Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did last week when he announced Rs100 crore in prize money for anyone from his state who wins the prize—will not be enough.

Science/Technology,This is how falsehoods spread: Smriti Irani on how Fields Medalist Manjul Bhargava teaches math,146,5sygz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5sygz4/this_is_how_falsehoods_spread_smriti_irani_on_how/,103,"Manjul Bhargava is a famous Fields Medalist of Indian origin who teaches at Princeton. His nationality is Canada/US. He was born and brought up there but also visited India on holidays.

Like many other mathematicians he has compared poetry and music to mathematics. He has studied Sanskrit poetry at college level. Here is a quote from him

> ""As a child, I enjoyed studying Sanskrit, Sanskrit poetry and Indian classical music. I saw maths in all these things; that further inspired me to pursue mathematics. When I went to college, I took Sanskrit, a lot of music, computer science and physics, and also mathematics. To me, mathematics was the common thread in all these subjects""

As a lover of Sanskrit language, I know the distance between the statements “Panini’s grammar precedes any formal grammar by two millennia” and “Sanskrit is compulsory to get a job at NASA”. Then there is a rainbow of truths and falsehoods between them.

Here is an excerpt where our Education Minister (then) explains how Bhargava teaches math at princeton (at 1m30s):  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GGkIiZou5I&t=1m30s

> In Princeton, in his class — which is the most famous — is “Mathematics for Non-Mathematicians”. I have had the privilege of having talks with Manjul on many occasions and I know him well. And I asked him — what excites you most about teaching that class. **He said, I teach that class in Sanskrit and poetry from India**, and poetry that my mother got from her house in Jaipur. Now imagine Manjul trying to do the same in India …

Aside: the victimhood continues. She can’t imagine a math/cs professor talking about Panini when teaching BNF etc in an IIT. Imagine!

But more importantly, she is outrightly spreading falsehoods about Bhargava. I have followed his work and also his media appearances for some time. He is very mindful of what he speaks. He can never say something as stupid as “I teach my math class in Sanskrit”.

What does this mean? Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

EDIT: The link to the course in question:  
https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/course/MAT190

> Topics will include Number Patterns and sequences (2 wks.); Math in music and visual arts (2 wks.); Platonic solids, origami and the math of shapes (1 wk.); The Island of Zeke and other Logic Puzzles (1 wk.); Basic probability questions such as; how likely is it that 2 people in a class of 25 have the same birthday? (2 wks.); Modular arithmetic and prime numbers (3 wks.); Applications to technology, communications codes and cryptography (2 wks.)

Link to full discussion on The New Indian Express channel:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIokmVCl0mg",lallulal," It's called creating a narrative to suit interests. Maybe we could get Mr Bhargava to issue a clarification in this regard?  How can you claim you know better than her on this when you only follow ""Manjul"" on the internet. She actually knows him. Their friendship goes back to their Yale days. /s  After all Yale! > What does this mean? Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

What else can you expect from this drama(literally) queen? Remember she was once a bahu who was a saas once or some bull crap like that.  'member that time when a afternoon TV soap actress was our HRD minister? 

We kept on watching. Like we kept on watching her stupid ass show. In a democracy, people get what they deserve. ""Decimating information"" is totally correct. (2m56s) >What does this mean? Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

I won't be surprised if it's the former.  She don't know anything about Maths and Sanskrit. Chill homies.  > Now imagine Manjul trying to do the same in India …

Don't really understand why people have this Hindu victim complex. When have Hindus ever been stopped from expressing themselves? We have banned beef throughout the country, Sanskrit is available as a third language is almost all schools (both public and private) in North India (compare to Latin in Europe/USA),  Mahabharta and Ramayana plays are a stable around the festive session, extensive books have been written about Indian history especially the Vedic age...

If you're going to claim we invented head transplant or NASA has hired 500 Sanskrit teachers, then of course we ""pseudo intellectuals"" are going to mock you for being an uneducated kulcha warrior. Instead of crying Hindu victim complex, try and educate yourself about our rich history and culture which stands on its own without patently false embellishments.  what else you can expect from a RSS ""poche-wali bai"", .
It's RSS's legacy to put incompetent/unsuited people in higher up positions (like illiterate/retard modi as a PM) so that they can continue to spread their anti-nation/regressive religion ""manuvaad"" .  There is this perception among the Indian *gavaar* that foreigners are superhumans and their systems are beyond Indian comprehension. To even believe that a Math lecture is given in Sanskrit, in America, is so troubling. Even a Sanskrit lecture is not given in Sanskrit these days. Did Panini invent the sandwich press?

Jokes apart, it shouldnt be surprising to any casual student of math that math has its presence in language and music. In fact, music is very uniformly mathematical. There is a whole genre of computer generated music that is made through algorithms. >  Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

First one. 

""Never attribute to malice that which can be suffiiciently explained by stupidity."" >He said, I teach that class in Sanskrit and poetry from India

She probably meant ""... on Sanskrit..."". Otherwise the statement doesn't make any sense. Probably meant he includes topics related to mathematics and sanskrit poetry. See this link: https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140812-the-musical-magical-number-theorist/

> To his delight, he discovered that the rhythms of Sanskrit poetry are highly mathematical. Bhargava is fond of explaining to his students that the ancient Sanskrit poets figured out the number of different rhythms with a given number of beats that can be constructed using combinations of long and short syllables: It’s the corresponding number in what Western mathematicians call the Fibonacci sequence. Even the Sanskrit alphabet has an inherent mathematical structure, Bhargava discovered: Its first 25 consonants form a 5 by 5 array in which one dimension specifies the bodily organ where the sound originates and the other dimension specifies a quality of modulation. “The mathematical aspect excited me,” he said. op lurker here and i am not a mathematician did a simple Google

https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140812-the-musical-magical-number-theorist/ Is Manjul Bhargava of Bengali roots? I don't see anything remiss here. Smriti Irani does not mean that he teaches Mathematics in Sanskrit medium in the US. Manjul Bhargava does use Sanskrit examples in his lectures and his work.  If you saw, Man who knew Infinity, which was in collaboration with Manjul, you would know that Manjul credits Ramanujan's mathematical inspiration & intuitions for his knowledge of Sanskrit poetry which he heard from his mother in the village temple.

Point is, not many folks know origins of Fibonacci series predates to Sanskrit poetry (by Hemachandra) -- or so claims the person you 'follow' (Manjul).",2017-02-09 14:40:09

Science/Technology,Is it advisable to do MS in Data Science after 4 years of experience?,51,7bz6o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7bz6o9/is_it_advisable_to_do_ms_in_data_science_after_4/,30,"I have been working as software developer mostly in mobile technologies, but I want to shift to data science. I have good command in Maths, statistics and aptitude. But I am worried that maybe I have too much experience? 
",apjabdulkalam," I have 3.5 years and I have already applied for a masters. It's your wish. Do it if you want to. Don't do it if you have goals like marriage at 26 and babies at 28 and all that. Better to just do certifications and try for a data analyst's job. How can you have too much experience when you have 0 years of experience in Data Science?

Obviously employers are not going to consider software dev experience for data science jobs especially as there is nothing transferable from software dev to data science.

If you are wondering whether you are ""too old"" to do a Masters, that is something that can be only answered based on your personal circumstances. I am planning for MS and I have 5.5 years work ex. Having experience actually helps in finding good jobs after Masters. You should go for it if you are really serious. Lot of people do masters after 5-8 years of experience. Yes. It's a good specialization to get a degree on. Wait, you think 4 years counts as ""too much experience""? 4 years is nothing. In any case, don't let these things stop you from doing what you want to do. I switched my line (not data science) by doing a masters after 7 years of work. So, you'll be fine. I'd say try to get some job experience in the field before jumping into a very costly, and rather risky, investment. 

Speaking as someone who has interviewed several people after they got out of MS Data Science/Analytics degrees, I'd much rather hire someone with a couple of years of live experience under their belt. 


Learn the R/python bits of data science, take a few courses/certifications to make sure you know your alphas from your betas, and start applying to analytical firms or the DS wings of larger companies in India. The non-resident job market for data science US is pretty slim as well, graduate degree or no.

Obviously, take your chances etc. But know that it can be risky, and you shouldn't expect a red carpet after your MS.

And know SQL. Seriously. You would not believe the number of people who apply for data science jobs without knowing what is still the most common language for extracting data. Education will never go waste

Edit: Wow downvotes, People always starts counting benifits in terms of how much money you can earn directly out of it. Both are not dependent. All earners might not educated and all educated might not be earning. So my point is if you are interested in getting educated in something, suggestion is get educated. Follow your interest friends not your mates. 4 years is higher than average, but not terribly unusual. It's kind of late to start applying for next year's Fall application cycle imo, but you should try out next year if you're seriously interested. A few schools even have Spring admits, so that's something you should look into. I don't think it should be a problem to switch fields. As long as you are willing to learn and make the transition.

Not sure how exactly pure MS in DS/BA programs are, I heard an AMA somewhere on reddit, I think /r/datascience that most of them and even certifications in that field are essentially cash-grabs.

Check out /r/ datascience for similar questions and resources.

 its all your personal preference , i was in same dilemma year back, then i put my foot down and went for masters in data science.

 You'll always get 1000 reasons not to pursue masters / any other course and stay in your comfort zone. 

You have to decide what you want change in your life or you like it just it's going on like now.

Science/Technology,Rant: Are we condemned to being ignorant?,233,4uz3ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4uz3ms/rant_are_we_condemned_to_being_ignorant/,121,"I've been wanting to write this for a *long* time but somehow haven't been able to make time to sit and pen it down. This will be long, so please bear with me. 


Many months back, I came across this [interview](http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/aatish-taseer-india-is-semi-literate-and-chetan-bhagat-is-the-best-it-can-do/20150205.htm) with Aatish Taseer, where he calls India a ""semi-literate"" country. I was quite baffled then, by his words. Why would someone with such deep connections to India make such a disparaging comment on its citizens? Its true significance has finally hit me and it's making me sad.

We're a country of a billion people with few opportunities and deep contrasts. However instead of trying to bridge the divide, mend the fracture and soothe the pain, we keep insisting on magnifying the gap and adding salt to the wounds. 

How did we become so politically incorrect as a nation? How did we let bigotry define us to such a large extent? How did we let education fail us?

As Indians, our single goal as kids has been reduced to clearing entrance exams without realising the kind of studies that we're getting involved in, to get there. We're not broadening our minds to ideas, we're not enhancing our understanding of ourselves, we're not experimenting with out of the box ideas on science and technology. No. As 15-16 year old kids, we're solving questions. Recognising patterns. Trying to understand the examiner's psyche in order to get the most questions correct, sometimes spending months and even years in those hallowed halls they call coaching institutes. If you manage to set aside all the hoopla around coaching institutions, they're merely *cram schools*. Even our neighbouring China has them. But we as kids, and more importantly our parents, don't want to be told of that. Because deep down, that term *cram school* conflicts with our idea of what education should be all about. I, like many millions, was also a victim of this. Yes, I made it though. But I'm under no illusion about exactly what I've achieved. I've crammed and smarted my way through entrance exams by recognising patterns and understanding ""important concepts"" without ever learning to think for myself.

And then the results are in front of us to see. This [video](https://youtu.be/Rfw5nQy5_pw) popped up on the front page of my YouTube yesterday and I ended up watching it. One of the kids here appears to be incredibly cocky about what he thinks of people who weren't able to qualify for IIT. I don't blame the guy, maybe a few years back I'd have behaved the same way. But he exposes how limited our understanding is, of education. Our entrance exams, be it medical or engineering, are tough *because* we have such a huge population. That and because the number of institutions of repute (even though the IITs don't even rank among the very best institutes in the world) in this country is embarrassingly minuscule. 

College education is a similar tragedy. Teachers merely teach. Students merely attend classes. Teachers get promoted after a few years, students graduate every year. The teachers have no incentive to teach, they don't get promoted because of the performance of their students, they don't get recognition for using exemplary methods of teaching. And yet they expect students to do well, grasp concepts and become contributors to the society, magically. Our respect for teachers in this country runs deep. Unfortunately, that blinds us to the gross callousness with which most of them do their *jobs*. As a result, we graduate not as informed educated citizens, capable of engaging with a wide range of people on a variety of topics, but as robots. Robots capable of working efficiently, without having the ability to position us in the grand scheme of things, without having the ability to question and without having a worldview. 

But enough about institutional education. What about how we think? Do we even know *how* to think? Are we tolerant enough and respectful enough to differences of opinion? Are we accommodative enough? Do we know our history? Do we know who we are as a country? 

In the comments section of the same video I shared, you'll see many plainly abusive comments about SC STs made without realising how bigoted they sound. The hatred for the lower castes is clear. The hatred, often, isn't even about reservations. It's about a group of people who we think don't deserve to be where they are, or more specifically, where they are being allowed to go. How oblivious, how shallow and how deeply rotten do we have to be, to pick on the weakest section of the society, the SC STs?

The tragedy is not that we are bigots. The tragedy is how we *fail to recognise* how bigoted we are. The tragedy is not that we are inherently casteist as a society. The tragedy is that we constantly *fail to recognise* how casteist we are as a society. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ1EgsRT1zk), an interview by Ravish Kumar of an African student, exposes just how limited our understanding is of race. He is referred to as a ""gorilla"" in nowhere else but the capital city of the country. How can we as a nation, as a colonised nation in the past, not empathise with Africans? How can we be racist to a group of people who were treated the same way as we were by colonial powers of the day? In other words, how deeply has our education system failed us, that we have lost the ability to recognise our shared history?

If you go through comments on Twitter (and no I don't mean just the hateful comments directed towards a particular group of people), you'll realise how incredibly easy we find ourselves to be insensitive, even when we're not hiding under the hood of anonymity. An Indian woman, from a religious minority, was rescued by the government from a foreign country, in an astonishing attempt that brought out in me a deep sense of respect for government officers and diplomats. And then I read disparaging comments about her family on Twitter on the same day, by religious nut jobs. Add to that the hegemony, a certain group of people hold in our society, and the whole thing becomes scary. 

Bigotry and hatred, borne out of ignorance and pure cluelessness, have become a disease. And I will not even mention Facebook here because that is a cesspool of hideous ideas. Even some of my friends and colleagues, who I've known for a long time, have in many cases become absolute hypocrites, espousing hatred towards the disadvantaged and more importantly, towards the *different*. It's not about conflicting ideas of conservatism and liberalism. Its not even about the right and the left. It's about basic decency and having a semblance of understanding about our position as Indians in the world.

I do not excuse myself of this prejudice, of course. Having become a product of this system, I've also become a victim of the same kind of regressive thought processes that haunt many. May we all strive to, at least, *recognise* this, and if possible, mend our ways. 

We deserve better compatriots. Our children deserve better peers. And most importantly, this country deserves better citizens.

(Thanks for the gold kind sir/madam)",randompersonthrowawa," To get a country out of ignorance, we need a ""Book Reading revolution"" in the country. Please make your friends read a lot of books, long essays etc., whenever you meet a new person, ask them about their favorite books or podcasts.

We need a culture where things we do are based on reason & evidence rather than religion and personal politics. Just spread knowledge to as many as possible.

 Ignorance is an option people choose. In an age of information you just can't be ignorant until you conveniently choose so. People develop a belief and stick to it and when the truth hits them hard, most of them retaliate with meaningless ""what about.."" shit rather than accepting it and change. Our education system is crap, no doubt about it. It does not explain the nature of people though. I've met enough people who are bright but do support caste system. We are a what our experiences in life make us and that's why I loved this bit

>We deserve better compatriots. Our children deserve better peers.

Nice rant. There have been quite some thought provoking issues raised here.
Education, for instance has been criticised for far too long. I do believe there's a need for it change and get better. But will bringing a few structural or conceptual changes help? I highly doubt so. We have been so used to taming the system(as mentioned in the article) that we will find an easy way out. There needs to be a revolution all together that has to start from the central government and trickle down to the masses. The problem remains the same, resources. In a country like India where poverty is still a major concern, can we afford to revolutionise and bring in a  system that improves thinking and gives less importance to the cramming regime that has been running(the primary aim is still employment and not the broader vision of an ideal national). The resources and the sheer volume of population that comes with the country are too disproportionate. Maybe few decades down the line, we can. Another solution can be a government making one area (like education, health, manufacture etc) the key of their five year regime and focus on uplifting those domains one by one. (It'll always be difficult where revenue generation methods for the government are fairly limited and only a fraction pays the direct taxes).
But their is no two opinions on bigotry. We are and shall continue to be hypocrites. As children we learn ""Saare jahaan se achaa"", but the bitter fact is we are far from that. Governments, bureaucrats and the public are so self involved in what shows, that they forget what matters. We preach Vasudhaev Kutumbakam and yet commit racial atrocities based on religion, caste, colour, sex, dressing sense(the list can go on). The bigotry has been so deeply embedded into the Indian psyche that it can only be eradicated substantially. Since their can not be a jurisdiction which can enforce it, the leaders(celebrities who command mass support) need to take charge and engrave it in minds of people. Every caste based issue needs to be rejected by the people that show, to start with, and it needs to be an aggressive cry. We need to force rulers to act and the subjects to think on what matters and what discussion shall benefit the society as a whole and not a person or a small group. This was a *very* well written post.

I (24F) have led a slightly off beat life. As a child my parents didn't expect a lot from me apart from good grades which too stopped after 10th, because I told them I don't care anymore. Mom wasn't disinterested in me, she just let me be. Dad was more interested in making my elder brother an engineer (he ran off after flunking the first year, came back and got into animation, is fairly successful now in the US). I studied my ass off in 9th and 10th and have suffering from the ill effects it has had on my health ever since. I got great marks which was *meh* for me. After 12th, I decided I didn't want to be an engineer despite scoring decent marks and loving CS. I went for English (H) in a good college in Delhi, got decent enough grades, stopped giving a dime for what others got or what others thought about me. My parents let me be. They didn't ask for my marks and I didn't tell them either. Then I stayed at home for a year, tried my hand at Applied Psychology (MA) because I have a personal connection with mental illness and I know how much a mentally 'disabled' person has to suffer in our country because of the lack of empathy and information about it. Didn't like the college and four months later, applied for MA in Development at a new university in Bangalore and got through. I spent the two most enriching years of my life there. I specialised in Sustainability. With this came a desire for equality between classes, castes, genders. A hatred for what neolibralism is doing to people and our country and for those who rush towards high paying (with blood money), division creating jobs with a higher footprint and disregard for what their life styles are doing to the people and this planet. I also know now how to weed out the real NGOs from others and unfortunately, most of those are headed by people very much into blood money who think for instance, that an iPad can solve poverty issues (IT4Dev for people who know this lingo). Personal opinion.

Why am I telling you all this? Because, as of now, I have no job, no opportunities that I find honest and ethical enough and am currently mooching off my father's money (government employee but who says the government doesn't deal in blood money). I am desperate as I look for the right place to work at. Sure, I teach underprivileged kids who want to learn and practice sustainable living and don't personally indulge in consumerism, but everyone knows that it doesn't do jack. In my desperation for a job that pays me enough to stand on my own two feet, I have now begun looking at companies that support neolibralism and have ecologically and socially unsustainable practices. I can no longer sit and judge. I know what I'm getting into but I don't know any other way. I am a hypocrite, so to speak.

This is how the real world forces people like me to swim with the current. Because although I want a paradigm shift, I know I'll have to live a pauper's life and alienate myself even more to stay true to what I believe is right. I used to look down at people like me, now I am one of them because I don't have an answer. For a country to be enlightened from ignorance we need a functioning society, today India has too many societal problems like Overpopulation, Crumbling cities, Gender discrimination and violence, Malnutrition, bad education system etc.,

unless we stabilize these problems it's hard to get huge overpopulated like ours out of ignorance. You need a TLDR

What makes you frustrated? You cannot make 1+ billion people open minded and prejudice-free; there will always be people thinking like that. Its not about education; we learn from our environment as well. My guess; thats where most prejudice come from.

Logic and critique does not win convince people on these as well; have you forgotten the massive wave of 'whataboutism' killing arguments. I can always raise the culture card and that how ancient our civilizations is thus whatever exists works as it survived...

Who does curriculum and education system? Do you not think an informed citizenry is dangerous for the political class?

Be the change is the only real way; maybe influence your close ones.

FInally; when brexit can happen in a supposedly (and i am assuming here) more educated country; or the trump campaign doing well in the only superpower of the world; do you really think we can get rid of the shit we have? Very well written, totally agree with you. Sad but true :/ The rant is a little too big for me to finish reading it, but I will just add my mini-rant here:

What you say about students being forced into some kind of entrance exam mode is one of the main problems.

I feel our entire current generation has entered some kind of entrance exam rate race and has neglected everything else. 

For a country of 1.2 billion people, our contribution to world culture, music, art etc is abysmal. We atleast used to have some great internationally acclaimed musicians. Pandit Ravishankar was one of the biggest musicians in the world, he used to be george harrison's guru (george harrison was the guitarist for the beatles!) He was like a guru for the fucking Beatles! Who in this generation is poised to step into that level? Who is the next zakhir hussain? AR Rahman is the only highly talented musicians left. Are there any famous indian painters/ artists? 

Everyone who says ""Indian culture is great!!"", when asked about it, give examples from 200 years back. What is happening right now? What about our culture? 

Our schooling is so fucked up, we do not let the kids pursue any of these things as there isnt much money in it unless you make it big. Bollywood is partly to blame. Bollywood, being such a big movie industry has descended into a bunch of old men making shitty movies, giving each other awards. It is very hard for a musician, actor without connections to rise up. So you either have to become super successful or there is barely any money.

I was listening to some korean pianists, chinese musicians etc it feels like these countries have an overall growth with economic and cultural might and we are in some kind of a rush to get somehwere but dont know where. While I agree with you on most points, I do hold certain reservations - I think most Indians on the internet are from urban areas and they have little to no experience with caste based bigotry. Sure, They understand economic differences but caste doesn't mean the same thing in cities. I think it's unfair to call them out for something they intuitively don't understand. You say that the pivotal problem is that they ""fail to recognize"" but that is kinda inconsequential because the people who do practice bigotry recognize and it practice it none the less.   Firstly, well written. You make excellent points on all accounts. However, as some here have pointed out you may want to think about a summary. Anyway, regarding the education thing I couldn't agree more. The tragedy is that we ""learn so much"" in the indian education system and yet it baffles me how we still know so little. As an example, while I was enrolled in my master's in computer science program in the u.s. (stereotype I know) there were several other fellow  Indian students in my classes. It pissed me off when I realized that out of the hundreds of desi students less than ten actually knew how to program, the basics of computer science, data structures, algorithms etc. How is it possible that a person supposedly holding a bachelors degree in computer science from India knows less than an American freshman when it comes to actually applying their knowledge and can't seem to pass a test or assignment unless they cheat (which is a whole other thing giving us a bad name in foreign universities ) ? To me this is perhaps one of the biggest downfalls of our education system and proof that our educational system is pretty shit. You cram all this information, write countless exams, attend countless tuitions and coaching classes yet the second you have to apply your knowledge you are utterly useless! This is a very worrying trend. And not something that is lost on American professors. The sad thing is all of us end up getting a bad name due to it and there is a growing sentiment (at least in certain segments of the American work force ) that Indian programmers are not worth their salt. Which is really disappointing. I know this is not related to the social side effects of a shitty education system which you have brought up, but it is still worrying that the system is so bad. Regarding the social /cultural issues, most of us probably don't need to look far to hear an older Indian person say how ""once upon a time"" our culture was so great and accomplished things/had knowledge  that the western world only learned later. This is such a bullshit argument and a cop out. Sure, it may have been great once but it sure as shit isn't anymore and hasn't been for a long time. Why don't we have the collective balls to just admit this and address the problem instead of looking at the past and saying we were great back then? That accomplishes nothing. Yet we have the tendency to criticise western countries as being morally corrupt. Which is so hypocritical considering we have systemic issues with racism, sexism, violence against women, corruption ... the list goes on. > How oblivious, how shallow and how deeply rotten do be have to be to pick on the weakest section of the society, the SC STs?

Someone gets it.  This was very well written and I agree with everything :)

Solution cannot be simple, but I think less population and more education is the way forward. In a society where access to resources and opportunity is low, it makes perfect ""rational"" sense for the educational system to settle in the state it currently is in. India has very few educational institutions, right from schools up to the Universities, where you can get some semblance of a good education. Factor into it the social inequalities, and it becomes apparent that it is nearly impossible for us to have a subjective/non-quantitative entrance system. In fact, the JEE might be the only way a student from some rural backwaters can compete with someone who grew up in the more affluent parts of the country . As such, unless access to socio-economic opportunities and resources is made available to a wider population, alternative approaches to education might not work out well I think the root of the problem is the nature of current politics. You blame teachers by saying they ""merely teach"". May be you are suggesting that they work towards expanding their minds with knowledge.

But let me ask you something. What is the job of a politician? The job of a politician is to get their party elected in the next election. Members of opposing party think about playing political games that could win them the next election. While ruling party think about serving to the whims of the majorities, so that they can remain in power. Nowhere in the life of a politician, does he need to think of moving the country forward. It is always the next election. When politicians speak to masses, it is always to ridicule the opposition and never to provoke thought. So, you see, the job of a politician has been reduced to merely aid in winning of elections. I think a lot of the things wrong with the country can be linked to this simple fact. Now, this is more or less same all over the world, hence the problems you mention are more or less problems of the whole world. The thing is, society is controlled by Netas. That includes education and human development, or rampant ignorance/racism and other ills on the same plate.

Netas, glorious Indian politicians, are the most feral savages to have been born in human history. They are mostly illiterate, unproductive and have zero knowledge about how world works after 1950s.

...And they have been given all the power over Indian people. They keep holding us back. Op this is somethong i have felt for a long time, you have pulled those ferling put and have made eloquent post of it here. Awrsome post op.  To answer your question in the title - yep, as that is what the powers that be have intended for us. A small group of people control EVERYTHING in this world - do you think they want us to wake up and start asking questions?

The infamous robber baron John Rockefeller once said - ""I want a nation of workers, not thinkers.""

The education system serves as a mere conveyor belt for people to take the path of least resistance to get a job which offers a monthly salary.

It doesn't end there.

Capitalism has successfully moulded culture and has us perennially chasing things. Unless people wake up and realize that hedonism and materialism aren't the key to contentment, they will continue to walk in the dark.

Nice rant btw. OP, nothing can be done, India is a decaying civilization. Only a civilizational reboot will do. That will be possible with world war 3 or climate change catastrophe.  tl dr please.
 [deleted] Well Put and nicely written. 


We Indians as a society are more prone & concerned about ""what this society thinks"" than ""What I actually think"". 


Like horde of Sheep following, we have been practicing casual racism & casteism for yrs. We actually don't think at once that we're hurting others feelings. But we do all precautions to make sure that doesn't happen to us.  You said nothing new, so I'll gracefully ignore the rant and move on. How do you fix it?
The problem with the Don Quixote of this world is that even though their life and work make an inspiring story, but it has little or no effect on the society.
We will perhaps always lack decency in this world. I agree with you on most parts. But, 

`they don't get promoted because of the performance of their students`.This is how everybody in your class becomes a ""champion"". Only hope is to raise your kids properly. Now the problem is everyone thinks their way is the proper. Arnab, you don't need to do this, no one is taking your show away. Mummy will shoo Barkha away. TL DR; He is trying to say we are hypocrites, we don't have patience, we assume that we are always right without hearing and understanding what the other person is trying to say and we are bunch of bigots. We ourselves are racist and we point finger at the world for being racist towards us. In spite of having billion plus people we don't have top class universities and still go abroad for further education. We have limited opportunities in every field and to top it the reservation system. We being a colony of the British for more then 200 years haven't improved in our thought process. We need to change our attitude, the way we look at the world and at other people. We should have little or no hatred towards other people irrespective of their caste, creed, race, religion etc. We need to become better citizen of India and more importantly of the world. we are like this only.

Science/Technology,"How an ambulance rushed through 500+ kilometers of narrow roads in Kerala in 6 hours to transport a critically sick baby - A true story of unity, determination, and togetherness.",126,7dkd0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dkd0z/how_an_ambulance_rushed_through_500_kilometers_of/,15,"I had written this as a late comment on [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7decjh/np_this_is_thameem_the_ambulance_driver_who_drove/) which blew up to get 1000+ upvotes. Someone suggested me to write it as a post to get better visibility. So, here is it.

The baby was sick in a pretty good hospital, but possibly had some serious heart issue, and one of the best specialized cardiac hospital in the country is this hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. They have researched and developed even their own prosthetic heart. 

The hospital where the baby was taken to is a super specialized hospital made exclusively to research and treat the heart disease of kids. It's name itself is Pediatric Cardiology Medical College due to its specialty. They only take extreme referral cases like this one. 

This hospital was founded before the independence by Maharaja of Travancore because his son, crown prince Sree Avittom Thirunal Rama Varma had an untreatable heart disease since his birth which led to his death at the age of six and the Maharaja wanted no one to suffer the same fate, hence such a super specialized hospital to research such diseases was created in his memory with the name Sree Avittom Thirunal(SAT) Hospital at a time period when even normal hospitals were rare in India.

Later, another bigger hospital was also started by the last Maharaja next to this hospital with more departments called Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum. And, this hospital was pioneers of various things in the field of cardiac medical science in the world. The baby was taken to this hospital.

This was the reason why the baby had to be transported there instead of any other hospital in the country. It was just the best option for the survival of the baby.

**Air ambulance** was ruled out because of the critical condition of the baby who had much better chances with a land-based ambulance.

Kerala has a good road network, but the roads are narrow due to the population density of the state. At many places, it is just one lane in both directions. Any traffic can delay by a lot. The normal journey in this route will take over 14 hours, yet this ambulance reached in less than half of that time - 6hours 40mins.

This was done due to the help of some volunteers across the state. A GPS device was attached to the ambulance and the location was transmitted to everyone. There were WhatsApp groups with people around the state.

When the ambulance is near any of the volunteer's location, they will remove the traffic of that location so that the ambulance can pass without any traffic. This was how they were able to travel at such speeds through so many towns. During the entire journey, they only had to slow down once at Alapuzha. Other than that, everything went smooth. There are lot of [videos on social media](https://twitter.com/Advaidism/status/931063525493022720) of people controlling traffic at various parts of the state

Along with volunteers, police also helped. Police vehicles escorted the ambulance during the entire journey and traffic police of each district made the arrangements to make the roads as clear as possible. It helped the Ambulance maintain 100 to 120kmph speed.

This story is not just about the ambulance driver. It is not just about the driver who drove the police escort vehicles in front of the ambulance. It is not about any single individual. Instead, it is about what we can achieve if a lot of people come together as one force. It is about togetherness. It is about unity. This story is awesome because so many people came together that day to make this happen.

Few such incidents have happened in the past too. A Malayalam movie named Traffic (2011) was made loosely based on a real incident similar to this. It is an excellent movie worth watching.  Traffic movie was remade into Tamil as Chennaiyil Oru Naal, in Kannada as Crazy Star and is also remade in Hindi, with the same name Traffic (2016). The best one is, of course, the original movie.  Watch the original movie if you can, as it is a unique movie which is shot from the perspective of a dozen people in a way no Indian movie has done before.

I wish we can see such camaraderie in everyday life in India, it will surely be a better place.  bravo somalian pirates, you robbed ship carrying my heart.. Sorry this may seem crass to point out in such a serious issue , but I find it really funny that some producer in Kannada industry thought to name their movie about life saving ambulance as 'crazy star'.  Last year I had to travel from Thrissur to Trivandrum in an ambulance. The driver was pretty fast and it was quite scary to look through the windshield. The vehicle had to turn and weave quite a lot because of the narrow roads. Our roads really need to be widened. I had driven the other way just the previous day in my car. Since the vehicles move for you when you are in a blaring ambulance, it does give you a perspective of how fast travel within Kerala could be with wider roads.  When we are ""we"" ,

With the global economy yet to recover from the 2008 economic crisis, concern about the future— especially of advanced economies—is intensifying. My Northwestern University colleague Robert J. Gordon captures the sentiment, arguing in his recent book, The Rise And Fall Of American Growth that the productivity enhancing innovations of the last century and a half cannot be equaled. If true, advanced economies should expect slow growth and stagnation in the coming years. But will the future really be so bleak?

Probably not. Pessimism has reigned over economists’ outlooks for centuries. In 1830, the British Whig historian Thomas Macaulay observed that, “(i)n every age, everybody knows that up to his own time, progressive improvement has been taking place; nobody seems to reckon on any improvement in the next generation.” Why, he asked, do people expect “nothing but deterioration”? Macaulay’s perspective was vindicated by the dawn of the railway age. Transformative advances in steel, chemicals, electricity, and engineering followed.

When it comes to our technological future, I expect a similar outcome. Indeed, I’d go so far as to say, “We ain’t seen nothin’ yet.” My optimism is based not on some generalized faith in the future, but on the way science (or “propositional knowledge”) and technology (“prescriptive knowledge”) support each other. Just as scientific breakthroughs can facilitate technological innovation, technological advances enable scientific discovery, which drives more technological change. In other words, there is a positive feedback loop between scientific and technological progress.

The history of technology is full of examples of this feedback loop. The 17th century scientific revolution was made possible partly by new, technologically advanced tools, such as telescopes, barometers and vacuum pumps. One cannot discuss the emergence of germ theory in the 1870s without mentioning prior improvements in the microscope. The techniques of X-ray crystallography used by Rosalind Franklin were critical to the discovery of the structure of DNA, as well as to discoveries that led to over 20 Nobel prizes.

The instruments available to science today include modern versions of old tools that would have been unimaginable even a quarter-century ago. Telescopes have been shot into space and connected to high-powered adaptive-optics computers to reveal a universe quite different from the one humans once imagined. In 2014, the builders of the Betzig-Hell microscope were awarded a Nobel Prize for overcoming an obstacle that had been considered insurmountable, bringing optical microscopy into the nanodimension.

Consider the revolutionary instruments and tools that have emerged in recent years. Start with the computer. Economists have made valiant efforts to assess computers’ impact on the production of goods and services, and to measure their contribution to productivity. But none can adequately account for the opportunities computers have created for scientific research.

There is no lab in the world that does not rely on them. The term “in silico” has taken its place next to “in vivo” and “in vitro” in experimental work. And entire new fields such as “computational physics” and “computational biology” have sprung up ex nihilo. In line with Moore’s Law, advances in scientific computation will continue to accelerate for many years to come, not least owing to the advent of quantum computing.

Another new tool is the laser. When the first lasers appeared, they were almost an invention in search of an application. Nowadays, they are almost as ubiquitous as computers, used for seemingly mundane daily uses from document scanning to ophthalmology. The range of research areas that now rely on lasers is no less broad, running the gamut of biology, chemistry, genetics, and astronomy. Recently, lasers enabled the confirmation of gravitational waves—one of the holy grails of physics.

Yet another technological innovation that is transforming science is the gene-editing tool CRISPR Cas9. Already, sequencing genomes is a fast and relatively cheap process, its cost having dropped from $10 million per genome in 2007 to under $1,000 today. CRISPR Cas9 takes this technology to a new level, as it enables scientists to edit and manipulate the human genome. While that idea may give some people pause, the technology’s potential beneficial applications —such as enabling essential crops to withstand climate change and water salination—cannot be overestimated.

Furthermore, digitization has lowered access costs for researchers substantially. All research relies on access to existing knowledge; we all stand on the shoulders of the giants (and even average-size figures) who came before us. But, until recently, learning what one needed to know to come up with scientific and technological innovations took a lot more work, with countless hours spent scouring libraries and encyclopedia volumes. Nowadays, researchers can access mega databases, where they can find patterns and empirical regularities.

Our scientific knowledge is surging forward, leading to innumerable new applications. Technology will forge ahead as well, in scores of expected and unexpected areas. It will bring economic growth, albeit perhaps not the kind that will register fully if we continue to rely on our outdated standards for national income accounting.

>* NEW DELHI: The government will invest close to Rs 500 crore to set up research parks, technological business incubators and startup centres in premier educational institutes like the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and National Institute of Technology, according to a senior official.These institutes had recently made proposals to the ministry of human resources development and the department of science and technology (DST) for such facilities.The official cited earlier told ET that the HRD ministry has committed Rs 50-80 crore towards over Rs 100 crore needed for each research park while the department of science and technology is likely to invest close to Rs 100 crore for setting up of technology business incubators (TBIs) and startup centres.The funds will be released when the institutes are ready, the official said.

>* Six institutes are likely to get funds for research parks including the IIT campuses in Delhi, Kanpur, Hyderabad, Gandhinagar and Guwahati, and IISc Bangalore.At present, only the IIT campuses in Chennai, Kharagpur and Mumbai have research parks.

>* The official said the move to fund such centres will help the institutes generate additional revenue with creation of intellectual property rights (IPRs).An official at DST said the government has raised the budget for innovation and entrepreneurship to Rs 180 crore from Rs 40 crore last year.

>* However, the institute's director, SK Das, said, ""We are internally ready for a research park and intend to push for this again.

>* We are asking for centres/schools focused on specific domains, named chairs, and so on,"" said IIT Madras director Bhaskar Ramamurthi.

She literally skipped 90% of the shit there was to know and just went on with ""vagina, penis. Now draw""  Critical thinking  Effective communication and managing good relations.

I kid you not, lot of your career advancement depends on how you communication and how you network.  

For a lot of you it may be natural. But introverts like me find it extremely hard. The shabby origins of all social constructs like money, credit, gender roles, societal norms, etc. [deleted] Basics like how to fill a check, how to handle things at banks, basic law, human rights, etiquettes, basic social behavior, traffic rules, money management etc. Just basic things that every person must know.

P.S - one of the girl ( 21 yrs old ) in my class  doesn't know how to fill check or do any kind of cash withdrawl or deposit in bank. -More importance to liberal arts! highly relevant in society. But parents only root for 'science' or 'commerce' for their kids. fuck those!

-kids should be made aware of basic economics like insurance/banking/income tax laws etc. before they reach adulthood.

-Moral Science till 10th grade atleast. 

-Environmental Science till 10th grade atleast.  personal finance  Basic psychology. I see a lot of people have cringeworthy interactions and feel a fundamental understanding of human psychology would have made things run a lot smoother. I feel having gotten to delve into it a bit has helped hone my interactions with loved ones, especially.

Sex education is the other. Teenagers need to be assured the raging hormones in their system is normal. Even in med school the topic isn't touched upon much. I still know way too many girls who shriek at the thought of boys/men watching porn, or masturbating, or even having sexual needs. No, no, those who do all that are fringe elements. Forget about women, that's not even natural according to them. It's understandable to have such views at 13, but when even at 25 you stay that ill-informed, that just shows the pressing need to insert sex education somewhere along the way. Logic. Fucking hell login would have gone a long way in fixing majority of the issues we face.  Statistics. 

I am a firm believer that statistics should be taught in depth before even introducing calculus. 

A strong statistical foundation is paramount in making sense of the world. Not many people, if any use calculus in a concious, meaningful way in their lives. However, statistics and probability, is used daily. It is also a lot of fun, it is the mathematics of gambling and games, of analyzing trends and predicting the future. 

Strong statistical knowledge also helps individuals make sense of the news where studies are reported. Statistical literacy allows people to see what the bullshit their politicians peddle is.  Taxation, Personal finance LPTs. Taxation and investing or at least basic finance. Shit is a bitch to learn on your own.  Basic law and the functioning of the judicial system Economics Philosophy and critical thinking. The science and maths portion is well covered. At least in theory. I struggle a lot sometimes in analyzing some issues. The more I think about such issues, the more I get confused. If they could have taught me critically analyzing a logic or argument, I would have save so much time in learning that.  Doing your taxes and cooking. 

These are essential life skills. Teaching spoken english. A lot of focus was only on learning grammar and just scoring in exams.  We need to impart that Education does not end with school/college (especially in this internet age). I support the idea of [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) which is more student-centric and allows self-paced learning. Geography Better calculus, and history and philosophy behind the subject Logical reasoning and critical thinking skills are desperately required in this country along with sex education. We're a country that has a great history with the performing arts so we should be teaching that too.  real life communicatuon skills , more focus on writing skills rather than mugging literature , touch typing Fact checking ( aka how not to believe every watsapp forward ).  - Being street smart
- Being more confident in your own skills
- communication and how you network.",2017-07-19 19:11:49

I did not study in IIT but from a deemed university (DAIICT) . This college was started by Dhirubhai Ambani , now part of Anil Ambani empire. We have humanity/design/communications course atleast one per each semester. We learnt about Gandhi, we learnt about how science evolved in India and its history, we learnt about environment, we learnt about politics, we learnt about management, we learnt about nomadic tribes, we learnt about various philosophies , we watched Sci fi movies as part of a course ,we learnt about how to build better buildings, we learnt about venture capitalism where such word was not even in Indian dictionary. Some of our seniors studied Anthropology. My one semester project was to analyse Telangana separate state agitation and provide the best roadmap ahead . we were studying ICT something related to IT and communications.

I would have been glad to take a Sanskrit course discussing ancient Indian literature, or take a proper history lesson.

One of my junior blogpost : http://blog.darshshah.org/2015/10/humanities-study-at-daiict.html

The point is : 4 years of Btech (esp in hostel campuses)  removes your worldly view when it is most needed . This is the age where you should not restrict yourself to learning one thing. Many people are not self learners and self motivators, but they have to better engineers. 

A better engineer is the one who understands not only to solutions better but also build better and right solutions. Name one decent college in the world that doesn't see the value in having some humanities courses for science and engineering students. Because a well grounded liberal arts education is critical for intellectual development? This is also the academic position of top US engineering unis like MIT and Carnegie Mellon FYI. 

Should IITitans also not read any books that aren't science related?  Because people who never went to college ate trying to run our universities.  [deleted]",2016-05-04 21:55:33
Science/Technology,"Universities must have more academic freedom, autonomy, says PM Narendra Modi",28,2r7wrb,http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/universities-must-have-more-academic-freedom-autonomy-says-pm-narendra-modi/1/214202.html,14,,janupbhoteyojana," >**""We want our scientists to explore the mysteries of science and not of government procedure,""** Modi said, while inaugurating the 102nd Indian Science Congress in Mumbai.
""Our institutions of research must become more broad based. Our universities must have a higher degree of academic freedom and autonomy,"" Modi said.
**In turn the universities must also subscribe to highest standards of academic excellence and accountability**, Modi said.

We'll have to wait to find out what that emboldened bit means in terms of specifics I guess...

On the administrative policy aspect

> ""As the major source of science and technology, government must do its part. When I speak of ease of doing business in India, I also want to pay equal attention to the ease of doing research and development in India,"" Modi said.

and

>**The Prime Minister said each government department should have an officer focusing on science and technology relating to its area of work and, allocate a percentage of its budget for such activities.**

(Awesome!)

and

>""We have to place the university system at the cutting edge of the research and development activities in the country,"" he added.

... as opposed to moribund government institutes? Cool. One difference being access to student population, and their talents. This demographic is still unencumbered by the livelihood phase, and is living in a setting where their only real responsibility is to learn. (Leading to a system where enthusiasm is fostered, rather than let wither)

Moving on... the PM, *possibly* on the parenting and socio-cultural aspect, says

>Emphasising the need to popularise science and technology, he said, ""Our children should see role models in scientists as much as in sportsmen.""

&
 
>""You will have no better supporter than me. In turn, I seek your help in transforming India,"" Modi said as he told the scientific community that their achievements should be celebrated ""as much as we rejoice in our success in other areas"".
""We need to put science, technology and innovation at the top of national priorities. Above all, we must restore the pride and prestige of science and scientists in our nation,"" the Prime Minister said.

A re-iteration of the publicly-acknowledged (though spurned in private) view. I still would like someone to simply pitch the awesomeness of science to the public - as a standalone... and not tied to pride, or its use for development, or national supremacy... but I guess this'll do for now.

Modi on the legislative policy aspect.

>He also called for clear regulatory policies for research and development in areas like biotechnology, nano-science, agriculture and clinical research.

There are other issues too, but his mention has now gotten me thinking: what is the Hindu religion stand on stem-cell research? (Or abortion for that matter?) Or genetic modification etc. etc.?

The PM's other observations in the developmental/fiscal/economical aspects

>A nation's progress and development is linked to science, Modi said.

&

>The Prime Minister called upon Indian industry to step up investments in science and technology in its own interest.

&

> **He said India's own pharmaceutical industry has carved out a place for itself in the world, because it invests significantly in research.**

(Are you listening, industry?)

>China's emergence as the second biggest economy is parallel to that country's strides in science and technology, he added.

The usual stuff, but I think I hear Western Pharma company CEOs, the WTO, and western patent lawyers turning in their graves. (They can continue to do so AFAI'm concered though). But yes, do Indian pharma firms really invest that much in R&D? As in IP generating R&D? As opposed to number-crunching processing/experimentation centres that use cheaper labour, without requiring this labour to do their own directed thinking.

Anyway, he goes on to recognise the historical approach to S&T policy, as well as offer his two cents.

>Modi asked the scientists to incorporate traditional local knowledge to develop more appropriate, effective, sustainable and affordable technologies that contribute immensely to development and progress.
He said the arms of science, technology and innovation must reach the poorest, the remotest and the most vulnerable person.
The PM also felicitated Nobel laureates and Indian scientists on the occasion.

  By Amit Kapoor  

 

  A special ""Nobel Series"" session was a notable addition at the latest Vibrant Gujarat Summit (January 9-12).  

 

  Nine laureates were invited to share their thoughts about the challenges of humankind and what could be done to alleviate them. A Nobel exhibition is housed in Ahmedabad's Science City for five weeks post the summit. The scientists discussed the importance of science and technology for India to become a knowledge superpower. They also interacted with students and shared their research and general approach to science and technology.  

 

  While all this bodes well for the rise of Indian states in the global arena, what is important is that, of late, Indian states are recognising the need for not only inviting creative individuals but also trying to enable an ecosystem that helps people grow and make the best of every opportunity.  

 

  A question is: Why foster science and technology or even creativity? Many scholars, economists and public policy professionals have devoted considerable time on understanding the sources of a nation's prosperity. Some of them opine that economic prosperity arises as a result of ""institutions"" while others argue that factors like endowments and geographic location are equally important. More recently, other scholars believe that productivity is the basis of economic growth and prosperity.  

 

  Recently, scholars like Richard Florida of the Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) at the University of Toronto have pointed out that the rise of the ""creative class"" could help explain the prosperity and economic development in some parts and the lack of it in other parts of the world. ""Creative class"", according to Florida, is a group of people engaged in creative occupations. These people, when given the right environment and ecosystem, enable innovation, which is the main driving force for economic development.  

 

  Urbanisation and the progress in technology over the past two/three centuries have meant that the flow of ideas and sharing of information can now be done much more quickly. This has led to the rise of the knowledge economy.  

 

  For tracking these developments, Florida and his MPI team have created a Global Creativity Index. The report is based on the 3T framework that forms the basis of economic progress within the city/state -- Tolerance, Talent and Technology -- that in turn leads to economic prosperity. If one looks at the most recent version of the Global Creativity Report 2015 one finds that most developed economies perform well -- Australia is on top, followed by the US, while Singapore, the only Asian nation in the top 10, is at 9, followed by the Netherlands. Also the share of the creative class in many North American and West European countries is closer to 40 percent.  

 

  Contrast this with India's performance -- 99th in a list of 120+ nations -- and there is scope for tremendous improvement. One of the reasons for this low performance is that the share of the creative class is quite low in India. This is due to an issue of quality education and skilling and outflow of people who receive good education. Less than five percent of the Indian workforce is formally skilled. The gross enrolment ratio is also quite low in India.  

 

  India is relatively good in the technology component but bad in the tolerance and talent domains. Even the BRICS as a block is not especially impressive with a diverse range of rankings. Brazil ranks the highest in the Creativity Index within the block at 29. Russia is outstandingly bad in the tolerance aspect.  

 

  The Institute for Competitiveness and Martin Prosperity Institute had previously tied up for research on India's ""Creative Class"". The research and ranking of the Creative Economy of Indian States was done recently.  

 

  The broad findings remain the same as last year. This year we have added a classification of Union Territories and separation from other states.  

 

  Delhi and Chandigarh retain rank 1 and 2, respectively, in the city-states/Union Territory category. Punjab moves to top spot this year from the previous years' third position (in the main states index) pushing down Kerala and Goa. States like Bihar and Orissa are bad performers overall and but have tremendous opportunity to move up in the years to come.  

 

  The maximum negative variation is found in states like Himachal Pradesh, which has moved down six places. Haryana has seen an upward movement of seven places, thus showing significant improvement in performance. States that have moved up in the ranking include Gujarat and Karnataka. The rankings among the Union Territories remained unchanged from the last year.  

 

  In the years ahead, India's economic prosperity will be driven by states and Union Territories and locations and cities within these that are creative. States that do well to foster the creative class will in turn be instrumental in driving innovation and economic progress.

Science/Technology,HRD Ministry seeks your views/suggestions/comments for creating 20 World class institutions by 28 Oct. Lets's do our part r/india.,134,56kz6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/56kz6z/hrd_ministry_seeks_your_viewssuggestionscomments/,51,"http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Public%20Consultation%20Document.pdf

Since most people are not reading the draft policy and trying to turn this post into how the GoI controls premier education and how bad the condition is. Look it's not that we aren't aware of it, we all know the reality but I hoped that this post will be about solutions, not cribbing about problems. Anyway here is the gist of drafted policy:

**Objective:**

To provide an **enabling regulatory architecture** to **ten public and ten private** Higher Educational Institutions to emerge as world-class Teaching and Research Institutions. (Right now we have way too many policy restriction on universities, they need approval for almost everything from UGC).

**What the hell do they mean by enabling regulatory architecture :**

These draft Guidelines & Regulations contain eligibility criteria, selection procedure, other Regulatory aspects, monitoring & evaluation, etc for World Class Institutions. These have been drafted considering the characteristics of a institutions which are world class which includes exceptionally high quality teaching and research standards preferably in multi-disciplinary areas; a significant proportion of international and meritorious students; a reasonably good proportion of qualified faculty from high-ranked universities worldwide, transparent and need-blind system to ensure intake of meritorious students; adequate financial assistance to students; a healthy faculty student ratio; well-equipped facilities for teaching, research, administration and student-life; adequate infrastructure for operations and expansion; autonomous governance structures; financial soundness through either a large corpus fund or recourse to public funding, as the case may be and, teaching and research collaborations with reputed global universities. 

The draft Guidelines & Regulations also provides for admission procedure, fixing appropriate fee structures pursuant to internal policies, appointment of faculty, collaboration with foreign higher educational institutions, and design and offer courses in existing programmes and new areas. **Additionally, these institutions shall have complete financial autonomy to spend the resources raised and allocated.**

**Expectation from World class institution:**

1.	It should preferably be multi-disciplinary and have both teaching and research focus of an exceptionally high quality. Apart from the regular courses, it should also offer various inter-disciplinary courses, including in areas of emerging technology and interest as well as those of relevance to the development concerns of countries like India. 

2.	It should have a good proportion of foreign or foreign qualified faculty. There should be a reasonably good mix of domestic and foreign students. There should be a transparent merit based selection in admissions, so that the focus remains on getting meritorious students.                          


3.	There should be laboratory facilities that do cutting-edge scientific research for those Institutions engaged in scientific research. In case of humanities and social science and other interdisciplinary areas, the faculty should be engaged in research and field work in frontier areas using the latest methodologies. 

4.	It should have student amenities comparable with that of globally reputed institutions. It should have a student enrolment of at least twenty thousand students in a period of fifteen years. The faculty student ratio should not be less than 1:10 after three years of declaration as a World Class Institution. 

5.	It should come in top five hundred of any of the world renowned ranking frameworks (such as the Times Higher Education World University Rankings or QS or Shanghai’s Jiao Tong University) in the first ten years of setting up or being declared as World Class Institution. 

**Financial assistance to WCI:**

The assistance would be up to an amount of Rupees five hundred Crore to each Institution in a span of five years from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The annual release would be dependent on the institution achieving the financial and physical outcomes laid down in its implementation plan. However, if any Institution shows capacity to absorb the funds earlier and is able to give the expected outcomes, an accelerated pace of funding would also be allowed. The funding under these guidelines would be in addition to the existing funding to which they are entitled to.

Rest pages talks about guidelines for institutions and their eligibility criteria.",bakchodibaba," You can't appoint political stooges to head institutions and then expect them to be world class or ask them to waste funds on a unnecessary flags.

Stop interfering with Universities make them autonomous, have real academicians head them and you will have World Class institutes. All the best universities we have are because they have been autonomous. A world class institution isn't it buildings, syllabuses, structure, facilities, courses, brand or history. A world class institution is its faculty.

Start small with a few courses. 20 institutions, 20 teachers each. Make a list of the 400 best Indian teachers in the world. Do whatever you can to get them to commit 4 years to teaching them in India. And give them full autonomy over everything - courses, syllabus, staff, what facilities they spend money on, mess food vendor, everything. 

Having committees, criterias, monitoring and all other bureaucratic nonsense will just lead to average institutions by virtue of the law of averages. Please have coed hostels to maximise opposite gender interaction I don't know  what constitutes as 'world class' but if it means being listed as Top 100 universities  by QS or THE, it's actually   implementable. These rankings give great amount of  weightage to peer reviews by fellow faculties and with poor researchers that we have , it is becoming hard to get a good ratings nowadays. 

Typically, only IITs look for people with international doctoral degrees  and that too includes fresh graduates from tier 3 US universities with less than stellar Publication record. Great researchers often  don't want to work in India,unless they are compelled to return due to familial reasons,  because of    low salary (IIRC it was around 90,000 rs pm ). 

 Some of my suggestion would include, 



Get rid of quota and nationality requirements for   assistant professor job postings. In fact make an actual effort to hire foreign faculty with good SCI publications as  these rankings give good weightage for the diversity and reputation of faculty .

Make  international PhD and postdoc as mandatory requirement. I hate to say this but many Indian PhD programs are joke really. I have seen people graduating  by publishing only in predatory  paid journals.  And as a result, they are literally unknown in their fields diminishing our rankings.

Increase the salary of the faculties to be in line with international standards. How else can we have world class researchers without paying them what they are worth?

Stop subsidising the  NIT and IIT courses. Inaddition to the subsidy, I was even paid stipend of 8000rs per month for pursuing masters but that was a daft way to waste the taxpayers money.  Instead government should increase the fee as dictated by market  and arrange for easy loans with few collaterals.

Priority should be given to carry out publishable short term research instead of long term  research projects with huge uncertainty. IMO this is the huge factor for American universities to fall behind universities like singua, NUS, and NTU in these world rankings .
These Asian universities basically game these rankings without actually being better in research  than their American counterparts.

The above changes may increase our rankings and make us look good at least on paper. But if you want to have the universities that actually help the society like US, it has to be done by creating   specialists research group for each field. 

 Unique Research groups are more hard to create and their impacts are mightily downplayed in the rankings. Take for example , Harvard.  It is not really renowned for its engineering programs but in my area of research bio inspired robotics, it has much more bigger impact than MIT , Caltech  , or CMU. If you look at any major developments in this area, it is basically through a Harvard alumni.  This sort of impact is painstakingly hard to create and measure. [removed] Appoint RSS guys to head these institutions like they did in IIT-BHU, ICHR, VNIT etc.   
 More interaction between institutions and society.  There must be a mandatory three year bond for these people to serve in rural area. Also they should not be allowed to leave country for any sort of job. No NORI should be given to them unless they pay 5 lakh rupees. [deleted] The best way to make good institutions is to ditch the 'University' model for all the institutions and focus on making a good single field colleges. In the old days we used to have Universities because the knowledge, books, teachers etc. were all scarce commodities so they were all aggregated in one place which was a metropolitan city. I don't know why that needs to be right now. 

For eg: If you have 5 institutions each with only one branch then it'll increase quality more than having one university with 5 branches. It makes sense economically as well, for eg: you have one university with 5 branches with 60 students each, then one subject professor and equipments are shared by only 60 students. You rather make a single institution all of which is devoted to, like mechanical engineering and it can have a batch of 120 students then all that resource can be shared by 120 students, and then institution won't have to divide money and students in 5 parts but all of the focus can be on single aspect. 

If you had the option to study computer science in ABC university which teaches everything OR ABC institute of computer science then of course you'll think that the latter will have higher quality education as all of it is about CS only.

The big universities are already LIKE THAT only, they have whole different buildings for each department which are independent, but there is no need for small private colleges to work like universities. They should rather remodel themselves to be really good at teaching one thing rather than teaching sub-standard 8 branches of engineering. I am big fan of institues like IIIT, which just computer-science and IT and ICT-institute of chemical technology which creates much better chemical engineers, let's say as compare to NITs who just get jobs in CS/IT anyways. Save money: Immediately stop all project grants, scrape all research fellowships; what do those idiots do anyways.

Use money: Set a cow university and a cow research institute. At least then we will have truely world-class cow scientists developing next-generation environment-friendly  gomutro based super-medicines and cow dung based fuel cells right in India. 

Profit.

/s I don't know man, creating 20 world class institutions by Oct. 28 seems almost impossible.

EDIT: TIL, no bakchodi allowed on /u/bakchodibaba's thread There is a huge set of sufficient conditions to create world class Universities in India, but only one necessary condition: freedom from UGC. This perverse Soviet body has no analog in country with a successful University ecosystem. 

It is not a coincidence that the best universities in India are not governed by UGC. Just as it is not a coincidence that BCCI, the most successful sport body in India is not registered.   It is very difficult to create world-class educational institutions in a vacuum. The political and industrial climate, living conditions, autonomy of the institution all play a major role.  Why would a person who could go to some other world-class institution in a better country choose to come here ?

- Nature is not deterministic. It is a chaotic system. A high degree of randomness prevails and even the best of models cannot eliminate this uncertainty.
- Nature does not behave in the same manner every time, there will still be some discrepancy between the model result and actual event. We need to be aware of 
 these inherent limitations.


**On comparison with more accurate forecasts in other countries**
>- I would say it is only partially correct. We give very accurate forecasts for cyclones. Other countries have more accurate forecasts over short-range, day-to-day variation, because of radar coverage and lesser uncertainties in weather systems. However, our extended range and seasonal forecasts are much better than them.
- There is a difference in weather events in other countries and India. England lies in an extra-tropical region. Their weather is dictated by frontal systems which are much more stable and predictable. India, on the other hand, is in the tropical belt. There is more randomness in weather events.
- In the US or Europe, their entire area is tracked by radars. It gives them better short-range forecasts. We don’t have radars that  continuously monitor every region because it wasn’t considered very cost-effective. We need 30-40 more Doppler Radars. We are in the process of getting them. Once we have more radars, our short-range forecasts will also improve. But our cyclone forecast is one of the best in the world. 


**On the availability of best technology**
>- We now have a very good computer system, which will be further upgraded this December. We have very good weather models. Many of our IMD officials are in charge of technical committees at the WMO. I am myself chairing a technical team at the WMO which provides regional climate outlook. If you are not the best, you would not be picked up for these jobs. 
- India is, and now it is globally acknowledged, at the same level as developed countries in weather forecasting.
- There are many other issues that apply to meteorology in general like our data-collecting capability over oceans is not very good. Even on land, it is difficult to get data from certain areas such as Afghanistan


**IMD on world front**
>- People in the WMO take India as the natural leader in meteorology in this part of the world. Our scientists are very well respected.
- India, being the natural leader, was asked not just to prepare forecasts for South Asia but also to train other countries in the region.


",souled_monk," What makes you feel they're incompetent. The guy is the head of the organization, and it seems like these statements wouldn't be too difficult to prove otherwise.   You need really powerful computers to run these kind of workload. These may not be available at their disposal.  Tl;dr
They are competent; do the best they can with limited resources...
Forecasting climate is very difficult and forecast are made for regions/clusters not for small areas... hence sometimes happens that they forecast heavy rain and its sunny outside your house --- you get the idea Predicting weather is very difficult as currently we don't have any formula which we can apply to get the final values.

Science/Technology,"Hi, /r/India! TRAI wants to know how we can hold telecom operators accountable for mobile data speeds. Here's how you can make your voice heard.",215,6esgm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6esgm8/hi_rindia_trai_wants_to_know_how_we_can_hold/,11,"Firstly, here is the consultation paper: [Consultation Paper on Data Speed Under Wireless Broadband Plans](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf) [PDF]

###**What is this?**

TRAI wants to know **how mobile Internet providers should be held more accountable for the data speeds they advertise.** Mobile data speeds are much more variable and unpredictable than fixed-line broadband connections, so TRAI is looking at whether they should make a 'label' from telcos mandatory that specifies what kind of speeds customers should expect from their connections. TRAI also wants to know what kind of tech they can use to *measure* how fast telcos' connections actually are for their subscribers.

###**Sounds great! How do I send in my ideas?**

First of all, take a deep breath. Telcos are going to have a really long answer to this consultation, and their lobbying will be polished and elaborate -- they do **not want to be regulated.** If you are a concerned citizen, you need to make your voice *heard*, not just *counted.*

Telecom consultation filings are not rocket science. You can send in a good and insightful response, and it won't take you more than an hour or two. Remember, your response **will be read**, and this TRAI administration leans towards consumers. 

**Read the consultation paper.** [Here's the link again](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf). Read it fully, it's only 30 pages long, and gives you enough context and information to be able to answer the questions.

**Draft a response.** This should not take you very long. You have a month to send a response in, so just spend a couple days collating all the points you want to mention in your response, order them under subheads, and work them into your answers to each question.

Make a PDF or Word Document of your response and email it to **kapilhanda@trai.gov.in**.

###**Cool! What's the deadline?**

The deadline is **29th June**. You can email TRAI and ask them to extend this deadline if you feel that this time is not adequate, and they usually do extend deadlines upon request. But try and get in on this right as telcos do, because TRAI may read responses as and when they ge them.

The deadline for **counter-comments**, which is an ***equally important stage***, if not more, where you have to counter arguments made by other responders, is **13th July**. 

###**What are the questions?**

Here are the questions TRAI wants you to answer. (emphasis all mine; text slightly edited for clarity). If you feel like you don't know the context for some of these questions, check the consultation paper; it will probably answer any questions you might have about the existing regulatory framework that telcos face.

Q1: Is the information on wireless broadband [mobile internet] speeds currently available to consumers *transparent enough* to help them make informed choices?

Q2: If it is difficult [for telcos] to commit to a minimum download speed, then could an
average speed be specified by service providers? What should
be the parameters for calculating this average speed?

Q3: What changes can be brought about to the *existing framework* on
wireless broadband tariff plans to encourage better transparency
and comparison between plans offered by different service
providers?

Q4: Is there a need to *include or delete* any of the *QoS parameters*
and/or revise any of the benchmarks currently stipulated in the
Regulations?

Q5: Should disclosure of *average network performance* over a period
of time or at peak times including through broadband facts/labels
be made *mandatory*?

Q6: Should standard application/websites be identified for mandating
comparable disclosures about network speeds?

Q7: What are the products/technologies that can be used to measure
actual end-user experience on mobile broadband networks? At
what level should the measurements take place (e.g., on the 
device, network node)?

Q8: *Are there any legal, security, privacy or data sensitivity issues
with collecting device level data?*

a) If so, how can these issues be addressed?  
b) Do these issues create a challenge for the adoption of any
measurement tools?

Q9: What measures can be taken to *increase awareness among
consumers* about wireless broadband speeds, availability of
various technological tools to monitor them and any potential
concerns that may arise in the process?

Q10: Any other issue related to the matter of Consultation.

Remember, if there's something that you think this consultation paper missed out on, include it in response to question 10.",shadowbannedguy1," TRAI is the only one who thinks public opinion matters in india It seems this paper only talks about wireless plans, but I see something very disturbing in wired plans (especially of local ISPs) these days.

These guys promise 50/100 Mbps, and you do get the advertised speed upto their gateway. But speeds to actual servers on the internet are highly varied - domestic servers and those with a peering agreement perform very well but random websites do not.

You can't raise a regular complaint because _saar see you are getting 50 Mbps_ and good luck trying to get such a complex idea through the skulls of CSAs. Can someone provide a common draft that we can send quickly? Just like net neutrality one?

I will add more. If People provide explanation that why we shouldn't read them, that will be better. 
It is not necessary that sources should belong to India. We can also discuss about BBC, the diplomat, IDSA, Washington post, huffington post, guardian and other internet resources (I am not implying that they are bad but we should discuss them)

I will add more. 

Some users pointed that there is no good journalism. But that's not right. There is a good journalism but we have to find it. I am creating these lists to help ourselves. As a conscious and educated citizens we have to be careful as much as we can. Sometime you can find a good article in the bad list and a poor article in the good list. Above lists are not strictly implying but providing a general idea for us to be careful. 
 ",Arjun_," So basically /r/india homepage should be avoided? /r/india I believe that if you're looking for a news source that's 100% unbiased, you won't find them. As well informed citizens and well adjusted people, the best we can do is read multiple sources of information and decide for ourselves where we stand on various political, social and economic issues...

I read both Kafila and Swarajya Mag. I form my own opinions and do not blindly take sides in politics. That's all.

Still, if I were you, I'd avoid all those new generation ""content creating"" websites that exist just to get more clicks and make profits from ad revenue. Examples would be: ScoopWhoop, DailyYo, Scroll, MensXP etc. tl;dr dont read anything Livemint is good journalism.  Should-read would make a shorter list.
Economic times is TOI minus the tabloid stuff.Washington post is a source I have always found to be balanced.For cultural perspective read the Hindu.Ignore it for economic stuff.Asia Pacific for defence and geopolitics. BC India ki toh koi site bachi hi nahin ab. All the sites that I know are there. The New York Times is good journalism? Kaunsi duniya mein bhaiyya? Their stories about India are generally trashy and look more like hit pieces than anything else. 

Also, as a ""right-aligned"" person, I find the Caravan excellent; their long-form pieces are pretty good. The Hindu, for all its left alignment, goes to great lengths to keep news and opinion separate. And their science and technology reporting is the best out there. For regular news too, your usual suspects (The Hindu, ToI, IE, HT, ET, NDTV, IBNLive) are fairly okay.

Among the newer publications, I quite enjoy reading Swarajya. They often publish articles by experts in various fields (Bibek Debroy, Syed Ata Hasnain, etc.) and other folks who either have several years of experience working in the fields they write about. Many of them wouldn't have found a voice in the regular mainstream media. The editing leaves much to be desired, but the content is quite alright. [deleted] well that's a huge fucking list. what are we supposed to read then? Add DNA India, The Logical Indian, Mili Gazette, Mid-day, The Statesman, Hindustan Times, New Indian Express, Daliyo, Story Pick to your list.

Edit: Outlook India and The Week Firstpost is the bane of existence. Everything from their news piece to movie reviews and political op-eds are based on sensationalism, so much so that sometimes they put TOI to shame. They are the self-proclaimed thought-leaders of new-age media, but with horrible taste for news. I especially hate their movie reviews; every snobbish mofo there is a wannabe Roger Ebert, with all talk but no substance. I don't know why people even read their stuff anymore.

Their general negativity was so repulsive that I unliked them from my fb to avoid their hateful feeds. There is no Good journalism. 

NYT is biased, India isn't its target yet. Guardian is relatively better but some of its guest editorials are down right moronic. 

Economist has a massive Anti-China bias, otherwise it has good content but one must never take it for good journalism.  
Same with TheDiplomat, massive anti-China bias.  

For domestic Chinese paper/mag, Caixin is best. I recommend reading http://www.thebetterindia.com and http://thealternative.in - Really good stories put out regularly. Add [project syndicate](http://www.project-syndicate.org/) too. You get great articles from highly qualified authors ranging from Jeffery Sachs, yanis varoufakis & Raghuram Rajan to Sashi Tharoor. There are rarely very long articles, but since most of the articles are by people who are some of the best in their respective fields, the quality is really good. wire scroll n fristpost Scroll.in, janatakareporter, firstpost, thewire.in, catch  Depends.

StartUp Beat Shanknaad pages and stories.  NitiCentral, OpIndia, TruthOfGujarat, CounterCurrents, indiasamvad.co.in, indiafacts.co.in  How is Indian express? The Telegraph is right wing, The Sun is a tabloid. Avoid anything from Rupert Murdoch. 

I read The Guardian but avoid their OP-ed posts. Oh I forgot Private Eye Magazine! They're consistently good & funny.

For Indian news, newslaundry seems alright so far.  [deleted] TOI website is actually quite good just they churn sheer numbers of news reports everyday some of them turn out to be shit but all in all they're quite neutral and good news source also add NYT and BBC in it because their India related news stories are heavily biased.

Edit - Dude NYT is not a good news source its the same paper which run the bullshit [Iraq has WMD stories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Miller) and in words of Noam Chomsky [NYT is pure propaganda](http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/noam_chomsky_the_new_york_times_is_pure_proganda_partner/). I like how entire publications can be written off by one user on an anonymous forum just saying two words. great work randia. truly

fwiw i agree with most of the OP's edited list I understand if a newspaper is biased towards a political idealogy that it manipulates news, then it should be considered bad source. 

But if the articles are well researched, should the alignment matter ?

Also few more to add to good reads list.

 * Newyorker (well researched long form articles)
 * The Atlantic (Entertaining, lacks substance, but good opinion pieces)
 * Granta (Good long form articles)

 I don't think any Indian newspaper left here which is considered good in randia. Reuters is a good source I like business standard.

I always found their news coverage to be adequate and relevant. Being a business newspaper, its coverage on personal finance, investing and observation of broad trends is good. Ignoring ultra biased Mihir Sharma, coverage of political news is minimal and mostly well grounded. Weekend issue has good lifestyle articles. You should certainly give it a chance. read the telegraph. really good paper, imo

for tech : android police is good, anandtech is good I would like to recommend Mint, Medianama and SpicyIP as sites that must be read. Also techcrunch? Seriously? I would recommend Recode and Anandtech instead. Also, could we please reclassify Newslaundry as media criticism + opinions instead of news?

Now coming to the political bias in the media mentioned in the first section. That is fine by me. I read them with the realization that they are biased just to get the view from the other side on several issue. I don't need to agree with ""them"" (the definition of them changes from topic to topic) or fight them; I just need to know how the other side thinks and feels about an issue. So do not restrict reading based on political biases. Bad clickbaity content  however should be avoided at all costs! That said, calling Buzzfeed clickbait becomes tricky as the news section has some good articles. http://www.buzzfeed.com/news You can say that Buzzfeed India is a bit clickbaity and they are unabashedly so.

PS: NDTV and IBN are yellow journalism? Do you even know what yellow journalism means? :D [deleted] Instead of targetting the negatives, can we have a list of good websites and blogs that do their niche thing or general thing (like news) While we're at it, can you guys tell me how do you prefer to read news on your smartphone? Used to read The Statesman when I was young. It was a great newspaper.

Surprised to see Caravan in the list of bad publications. It is easily the best article source I've ever read in India. It's features on Air India's destruction by Praful Patel, articles on the likes of Arvind Kejriwal, Arindam Chaudhary and Subramanium Swami were great.

The single greatest takedown of anyone I've read from an Indian source is this Caravan article on Suhel Seth.

http://www.caravanmagazine.in/books/age-seth Business Standard is a pretty good newspaper for financial news. Always found the articles well written; esp the opion pages.  India TV.  Good effort. Although it's usually a bad idea to eliminate major news sources. Know what their biases are and read different perspectives within reason. But obviously propaganda sources, govt mouth-pieces, tabloids, one-off blogs and social networks are really sketchy.

Good sources: 

International magazines/webzines: Economist (generally centrist, slightly right-wing economically) - it's not just a business magazine at least 50% is dedicated to international politics, Time (center-left), Salon (bit leftist).

BBC and Al-Jazeera get a lot of flak around here (""anti-india bias) but I've found most of their content excellent. Their documentaries are outstanding.

Vice (bit leftist) is a good documentary channel with a lot of current affairs.

Democracy Now is a good daily news broadcast, but sometimes a bit too leftist and conspiratorial.

John Oliver and Real Time with Bill Maher are good for US+intl politics, but remember they are comedy/satire shows. They're both pro-democrat.

From your current list, +1 for council for foreign relations and the diplomat. NYT, Atlantic are both great. Guardian is good, but some of their opinion pieces are occasionally absurdly left and sometimes borderline insane SJW territory.

Livemint is quite good (indian source, business news tilt). The Hindu, New Indian Express and The Telegraph are good newspapers with frequently excellent opinion pieces by guest authors.

I see a lot of people trashing Firstpost and scroll.in as being leftist. Like DailyO, these are a lot like blog aggregators, and it really depends on who is the author of the post you're looking at.

Sources to generally avoid:

 Most tabloids and almost everything with a conspiritard lean (ranging from globalresearch on the left to mediacrooks in india on the right). I'm not a fan of India today, in a lot of ways they try to sensationalize news and cater to what people want to hear. Times Now newshour is similarly just meant for entertainment, not a good source for anything. NTDTV, The Epoch Times, they are owned by Falungong, a religious cult, extremely biased against China. Add Zee news :P BBC for India related news is an atrocious source. The way they downplay incidents would bring tears of joy into the eyes of NDTV. What's left. I have no news sources now that I can use after seeing this list. :( Firstpost used to be the first site I check out each day. But stopped using their site completely some six months ago. Just sensational titles and complete bullshit in the articles. the indian express is both in the recommended list and in not recommended list Russia Today. It's basically a propaganda channel for the Kremlin.  firstpost.
Firstpost is not a real news paper.
It is just opinion in Trying to pretend to be better than other papers in use of English Language.
Scoopwoop.
The logical Indian..
Scroll I dislike the following for their agendas, lack of ethics, pretentiousness, lying, yellow journalism and various other factors  :

1) Scroll


2) Tehelka


3) Cobra post

4) jantakareporter

5) Kafila

6) Carvan

These all seem like some trash straight out of jhola of some JNU trash. The kind which wears kurta with chappals and drinks coffee in starbucks, gets drunk almost anywhere while abusing corporates


Among more mainstream:

1) TOIlet, is shit because all they know is to sell propaganda in guise of news.

2) The Hindu, so obvious left bias that it's not even funny. Pretends to be neutral, almost never accepts wrong reporting and in many cases, they just post whatever they can get away with. Their defence and science pages used to be nice. But haven't read the paper in years now.


3) Indian Express, Shekhar Gupta and Swamy are definitely on Paki payrolls. Manufacturing news like army coup to dishonour an upright general who firmly said no to corruption was just one of the lows this paper has gone to. Swamy is a perfect example of yellow journalism. Shiv Aroor when working for IE, routinely used to publish crap against armed forces, changed tone after leaving.


4) Hindustan Times, almost a complete Congress mouthpiece.




Among TV channels:

Any channel which employs Nidhi razdan, Barkha, Sardesai, Sagarika, Sreenivasan Jain and a couple of other soulless shameless turds of pressitutes. Includes NDTV, CNN-IBN and a few usual suspects.

 Thanks very much for this post! I raked up the courage to unfollow IBN and TOI from my Facebook. Personally speaking, they are sensational to the bone! Do add a few good media list too.  PRSIndia.org is good for legislation and parliamentary news. Is there any way to ban the websites reported here? by ban means not allowed to post on /r/india. Add dawn.com  it's a cesspool  Modi worshippers..(many) I blocked all these news sources long back on fb and twitter (so they actually see the impressions drop) and only subscribe to PTI/AIR and what other real people share.

I wish enough people block these sources using filtering so that they get the message and results in collective good. You forgot to add buzzfeed to the bad list (Clickbait)",2015-08-18 14:57:39

Learning a language is just learning syntaxes and how it is used. Building stuff will get you comfortable in picking up any new language quickly as the project needs. It will give you the confidence that you can do certain things.

After that, you can get specialized in one language if you want. +1 for fsko answer.
make something that you want for yourself.
to find ideas - make a list of problems that you face in your day :

my example list for today :
1) hard to wake up.
2) hard to be alert after waking up
3) new born son finds it hard to walk on his own.
4) too sweaty while travelling in mumbai
5) cleaning lady blocks house areas and this causes delay in getting ready
6) hard to start work and get off reddit india :)
7) too cold in office AC.
8) no good entertainment after office or during breaks.
--------------------------------------------------
some problems will reapper in your lists - these are the ones that are recurring and maybe more important for you.

good luck. 
good that you asked here - now follow the tips - thats harder than knowing the answers.
doing the right thing is harder than knowing the right thing. much harder.

cheers. Others have added quite good suggestions. I think having contributed to open source software is a good plus, it can be in quite a wide range of technology depending on what project you choose.

One good way could be contribution to some open source organisation through Google Summer of Code. It also pays a good amount (~ $2400) for a 3 month bonding with an open source organisation. Personal app building is good, but you wouldn't be able to see how good/bad you did with the project. Contributing to open source gives your more idea of real-world software building as a student. Javascript and all its prominent tools and frameworks in the ecosystem.  Languages - Domain ( Frameworks)
-------------------------------------------------------

* C# - Desktop Apps (WPF)
* C# - Web Apps (server side on  Win & Linux : ASP.NET, WCF, .NET Core)
* Swift, ObjectiveC - Apple Apps (iOS + Mac)
* Kotlin, Java - Android Apps, Legacy Java apps
* C# - Android Apps (using Xamarin)
* Javascript, Typescript - Web Apps (client side: ReactJs, VueJs, AndgularJS)
* Javascript, Typescript - Web Apps (server side: NodeJS)
* Python - Web Apps (server side), Scientific Programming
* C / C++ - Performance oriented libraries (like game engines, video encoders etc)
* C++ - Desktop Apps (QT Framework)

Pick what domain you would like to work in & try a language
 TL;DR : If you are sitting in placements then Java, C/C++ with good practice in coding should help you secure a job.

Most jobs at major companies (Google, Amazon, Fb, Flipkart, PayTm etc) only look for coding skill. Even though that has nothing to do with the job profile, but that is the way it is. So, solve a lot of alogrithmic probelms (geeksforgeeks, hackerrank etc) and you can secure a job at any good compnay. Good luck.
 Java + Node JS should be good. 

Also, do courses from Udemy, coursera on big data.",2017-09-12 15:20:14

KOLKATA: A 14-year-old has wowed cityscientistswith her discovery of the impact of the 'Om' sound in reducing fatigue.Anwesha Roy Chowdhury, a Class-IX student ofAdamas World School, topped the recently heldScience Congressorganized by the state government.



Her findings that chanting of 'Om' increases oxygen level in blood and lowers carbon dioxide and lactic acid, which reduces the level of fatigue, were vetted by physics and physiology professors of Calcutta University andJadavpur University. Debashish Bandopadhyay, head of the department of physiology, Calcutta University, told TOI, ""Anwesha's project is innovative, it's quite flawless and convincing.""



An-we-sha, who likes to spell her name thus, since anweshan in Bengal means 'search', told TOI, ""I found that sounds with a particular frequency, if heard or recited right, raises the level of neurotransmitters and hormones like serotonin, dopamine, DHEA etc. Because of their vasodilatory actions, the oxygen level in blood soars. It also produces less lactic acid and allows the person to act without fatigue.""



""In the last decade, the body of research on workout music has swelled considerably, helping psychologists refine their ideas about why exercise and music are such an effective pairing. But this specific finding on the 'Om' sound is impressive,"" said Rina Venkataraman, secretary, state science and technology department.



""No one has ever pin-pointed on the 'Om' sound and conducted such comprehensive experiments on its use,"" Dipankar Das, senior scientist, state science and technology department, said during a workshop conducted on 165 students who were shortlisted for the statewide Science Congress recently.



It all began when Anwesha visited Uttarakhand, where she ""found some priests carrying water from Bageshwar to Kedarnath, covering 68km every day, without tiring. The priests sang a tune all along. There was no way she could reproduce the same mantra for her experiments. So Anwesha started looking for a similar tune.



""Finally, a tune with 430+ Hz frequency clicked. In five experiments in various laboratories, I measured the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels of 17 adults (all on the staff of BITM) while listening to the tune for 30 minutes, and there was an increase of oxygen level and decrease in carbon dioxide in their bodies,"" Anwesha said.

Science/Technology,[NP] Need help in switching stream to Big Data Analytics/development.,13,21zxad,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/21zxad/np_need_help_in_switching_stream_to_big_data/,20,"I am looking for switching my stream to Big Data analytics. Where do I start? I would like to attend a training course (online preferred) and get certified from an organization like Cloudera in Hadoop/HBase.

My background:
- 3.5+ years of IT experience in a niche tool. Not much jobs here so I am not able to switch :(. 
- Started the coursera course 'Intro to Data Science' last year, but had to leave it halfway due to some reason.

Any help would be much appreciated!",hey_dog," Unsolicited advice - There's an ocean of difference in learning *Data Science* and learning *Data Science Technologies*. Learning Hadoop is *Learning a technology* while learning Distributed Computing/Architecture is learning a science/concept. Why am I stressed on making the distinction? Science/concepts remains but technologies change. It's easier to switch between technologies if you know the science. Vice-versa is possible but difficult.

Since you started the Intro to Data Science on Coursera; Bill Howes from University of Washington (instructor) stressed on this aspect too. Which city are you from? We have a Hyderabad Data Science group (google search for details), I think there is a similar one in Bangalore. No clue about other cities. If you can follow a degree on machine learning, data mining or statistics ( or mathematics ) you would be suited for big data analytics. To be honest, I donot have any knowledge of industry certification; most of my knowledge is from academia. 
In academia, analysis of extremely large data sets , like Facebook, has been studied for some time.  Why did you stop the class last time? And also are you currently employed? Cos Coursera is offering Data Science specialisation and it costs approx 30K. If you can spend weekly 5-6 hours for each 3 courses, you can finish this specialisation within 6-7 months. All the best!

Even I am interested in data and classes commence from April 7th. Enrolled into 3 courses as of now. Paid $150.  screw most of the advice here, so far.

Just do statistics,statistics and more statistics.  At least upto t-tests, F scores.  

Do not worry about hadoop.  Know your stats and numbers; they'll be enough AP guys to code for you in hadoop.

Maths, you either get it or you don't.

without going into details i take 'care' of this area where i used to work.  This thread needs to be relabelled: I heard there is more money in big data. I don't care about the field, just the certificate and a job to fuck up.

Science/Technology,Spoiler Alert! Only for people who have watched it or don't care if they ever watch it - My Analytical Review of the movie Dunkirk.,23,719nda,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/719nda/spoiler_alert_only_for_people_who_have_watched_it/,12,"While Inception and interstellar, though fascinating, were unrealistic and defied all rules of science, mathematics and common sense, Dunkirk, is Christopher Nolan's best movie yet. I recently watched it and I wanted to key my thoughts down and see what else people may have gleaned from the movie. I gleaned something that pertains to India-China standoff(s) among other things.

So, basically, Dunkirk is about 400,000 men, British and French, stranded in enemy territory in WW2. With the enemy closing in from all sides, the British are waiting for rescue to get back to Britain which is visible across the channel from Dunkirk Situated in France. That's basically it. However, the movie spans on much more and the unique Nolan mind-wrangling makes it more interesting than the simple premise stated above.

The movie begins with a staggered timeline. It follows the pilots of the Spitfires over a 40-minute long journey to Dunkirk while it follows the struggle of the 3 soldiers with the ships and in water in trying to escape from the beach for days. It even ends with a staggered timeline following the seamen and soldiers days after the incident while following the pilot only minutes after the climax. IMO, apart from trying to capture the chaos of war, this reflects on two things - 1. The British Navy and Army have existed for hundreds of years while airforce is relatively new. It may also be symbolic of the fact that there are nations that have existed forever and they will continue to exist forever even in the face of new ones that may come up. 2. The advent of new technology makes us dependent on it. We see how dive bombers keep killing thousands and sinking rescue destroyers and the soldiers keep asking ""where is the airforce?"".

Next, it focuses on the butterfly effect. Farrier's fuel gauge is broken and he is given the choice to turn back but he chooses to stay the course and ends up saving the entire rescue. If he had just chosen to turn back, all the planes he shot down wouldn't have been shot and the rescue may not have taken place or been as effective.       
Similarly, Tommy tagged ""Gibson"" along who ends up saving their lives by opening the door on the ship sinking because of the torpedo. 

We also see that the massive and powerful destroyers are bombed by the enemy and are unable to rescue the stranded soldiers, a feat that is accomplished by civilian boats. This, to me, highlights the fact that it is not the military might of a country but the spirit of its people that wins wars - something Winston Churchill had alluded to in one of his addresses to the nation. Also, it tries to present that one should not underestimate small nations (like Britain represented by small boats) because they may accomplish feats that big nations (represented by the destroyers) may not be able to achieve. There is also another moment where the soldiers ask the civilians of the Moonstone saying ""we let you down, didn't we?"" reiterating the fact that how the military may have let the country down but the country did not let its soldiers down. We also see the spirit of the people when we see Dawson and his son heading fearlessly towards Dunkirk to rescue the stranded soldiers but the Shivering soldier, Fortis leader, is afraid to go back and many times tries to force them to change course. However, they hold steady, determined to complete the mission. We also see that civilians trust themselves to be more quick and effective than the military and all the bureaucratic red tape when Dawson doesn't wait for the navy but sets off on his own to do the exact same thing he was requisitioned for. 
 *And this is the part of the movie where I would like to mention how it relates to India. The fact that the strength of the military isn't everything in the war, the spirit of the nation matters more is why India should never cower before China. They may have better machines, we have better people.*

Next, there are elements of poetic justice in the movie. We see that Tommy, who stands up for ""Gibson"" in the Dutch boat is saved by the Moonstone but the Highlander who wants to sacrifice ""Gibson"" because of him being French and then Tommy who is not a member of the Highland regiment is forced to come up for air and is burnt alive - or poetically speaking burns in hell. Then again, Alex, who is pragmatic vs Tommy who is more moralistic in comparison face resolution of guilt at different times. While Tommy, who is more considerate and observant (remember he is the one who talks about the ""grouping"" of bullet holes), notices that the man handing out blankets on the train station is blind. When the old guy says, well done, he asks him ""But all I did was survive"", the old guy says "" That's enough"". His guilt and burden is resolved and he can peacefully sleep on the train. Alex, on the other hand, because of his superficial nature, burning guilt and less regard for others, thinks that the guy is so ashamed of them that he can't even look them in the eyes. He faces this guilt all night, even reads hatred from the people in the headlines of the newspaper and cannot look at the people until he sees that they are applauding them not spitting in their faces. This reflects on how we see in the world a lot of what we are and what we feel inside. It also touches upon the fact that ultimately, the soldiers' guilt and burden can only be lessened by the country and they feel as successful as the nation makes them feel. Their victory is not at the fronts but in the eyes of the nation and they always want validation from it. We also see this when Peter tells the Fortis leader that George will be okay even though he is dead. It suggests that it is a sort of duty of the civilians to grant clemency to the soldiers to relieve them of their burden.

Also, the movie seems to sort of touch on the fact that how one ""good soul"" is worth more than many average souls. It seems like good people keep taking the place of many average people in the movie. eg, ""Gibson"" saves Tommy, Alex, and others from drowning but ends up drowning himself. ""Farrier"" saves the 300,000 British soldiers on the beach from the dive bombers and the army that has broken through the perimeter but ends up being taken hostage by the Germans himself. It always seems like they take the place of many good people and God/ Heaven/Universe is content to exchange their one soul for the souls of many. Also, this shows how miracles don't just happen. Every miracle has a cost, the life of someone else, someone else's sacrifice for someone else's gain.

Then there is a glorification of war and our duty towards glorifying it. How young men are encouraged to die in futility many times in the name of war. We see this aboard the Moonstone as Dawson, Peter, and George set sail to rescue the stranded men. While Dawson and Peter save many men and fulfill an important mission, George only joins them because he wants to be a hero in the war zone and wants his photograph in the paper. He is just observing and trying to make himself useful but ends up dying before he could actually do something substantial. Again, the futile deaths and suffering in the war is highlighted when the man trying to escape to the destroyer gets caught between the ferry and the destroyer and ends up with crushed legs. Also, there is a difference in how Dawson and Peter look at the Shivering Soldier, the leader of Fortis air trio. While Dawson tries to understand his pain and looks at him as a human, Peter looks at him as a coward for not wanting to die in the war. In the end, however, we see how the experience changes Peter, who gives clemency to Fortis Leader by lying to him by saying that George will be fine. We see how Dawson approves of this. Again, a reflection on how war changes people and a reflection on our duty towards the soldiers and not just their duty towards the nation. We also see the irony of Dawson sympathizing with the plight of the Shivering soldier who is afraid to go into war, kills George and is trying to prevent Dawson from rescuing soldiers when Dawson's own son died in the war. We can see the effects of war on people again when the camera shows Peter and Tommy, two people of almost the same age but one weighed down by the horrors of war and the other a lad just coming to terms with the disillusionment of what war is.      
We also see that it is the civilians who make the heroes what they are. Heroes are formed when the nation accepts them to be so. We see that when Peter and Dawson get George's picture printed in the newspaper and only then Peter gains satisfaction. This reflects on that every life lost in the battle is treated with respect irrespective of circumstances for the satisfaction of the loved ones that their children/siblings/spouse did not make the ultimate sacrifice in vain, even when so many wars are futile.

Then there is the contrast in the thinking of people in accordance with their ranks and situations. The soldiers are fighting on the Dutch boat and want to sacrifice the French and then the non-Highlanders to survive. On the other hand, the French ""Gibson"" saves Tommy and Alex not once but twice, once by opening the door and the second time by slipping the rope from the boat. We also see this discord when the French soldier asks Tommy to move along from the French line at the beach in the beginning of the movie. The admiral, on the other hand, wants to stay back to help the Fench at the end of the movie. We have seen earlier in the movie admiral saying ""we should get our army back for the next battle which will happen in Britain"" but he seems dejected when Britain seems dejected when Britain seems to hold off on destroyers saving them for the next battle. Again we see how the military can let its own people down and the civilians never do. Another example is when the Highlanders on the boat refuse to let Tommy and Alex on but ""Gibson"" slips them a rope. We also see this spirit again when the civilians hail the arrival of the soldiers after all they have done is survived.On the other hand, ranks may not really mean much as we see that Farrier ends up saving the day while the Fortis Leader is a trembling mess and ends up killing a civilian. In all of this, the movie tries to highlight that soldiers, too, are just ordinary men doing their best to survive extraordinarily stressful events one minute and one event at a time.

It also focuses on how the efforts of so many remain unsung in the war. Like when soldiers accuse Collins of not being there for them aka airforce not doing enough for them at the station while Dawson reassures them they know you were there for them. Again, how the country never lets its soldiers down and how the nation's validation is important for the soldiers fighting for it.

Then there is the ending. The fact that Farrier keeps gliding even after the last drops of fuel have run out captures the spirit of the soldiers and the nation to fight until its last breath. The fact that even when dying it manages to save thousands of people by shooting down the last plane shows that even if a soldier or country is going down, it can save other people and countries and give them the miracle of living on. Of how Farrier, instead of just ejecting from the plane, lands it down and gives it a proper patriotic send-off by burning it. Which goes to show how the people of a country don't just jump off from it when it goes down, they respect it to the end even if it is burning due to war, internal struggles, whatever. It also reflects on the fact that though the main player may have gone down (Farrier) the many people who survived would, because of him, carry on the legacy which lines up with the ending of the movie which says that even if Britain went down, its colonies abroad would carry on their legacy. ( I have some words regarding that legacy of colonies but that is not the point of the movie). And lastly they show the Plane in flames but its structure still stands respectfully because of a good person like Farrier which showcases how the entire Europe burned in the World Wars (of their own making) but the spirit and the structure of Europe survived it due to the ""good men."" Again, a reflection on how the respect for a country is determined by the character of its people.

In the entire movie the themes that are common. Wars are not won by armies but by the spirit of the people. Armies may let countries down, but the country never lets it down. Poetic justice finds its way. How war changes people and the duty of the citizens to laud the soldiers who choose to fight regardless of everything.

I also appreciated small things that were incorporated. eg. at the beginning when the dive bombers bomb the beach when the explosions are far away, the sound is delayed from the visual of the explosion but when the explosions come near, the delay decreases. Something that is correct according to the laws of physics but I have never seen depicted in movies and have commented on in my head while watching the movies in the past. Then, how Tommy meets Gibson while attending nature's call. It's just wrenching that he just survived an attack on his life and then he just goes to attend his business. It is disturbing that attacks on the lives are just as routine to the soldiers as reading a newspaper is to us and the movie captures this well. Then when dive bombers throw bombs over a bridge, Tommy covers his ears. It's not the depiction of a war hero like in many other movies, its the true depiction of what soldiers are, just humans who chose to go to war and have to face horrible situations. It is also depicted with Farrier when he shows perplexion and uncertainty many times. I really liked that there was a Dutch merchant sailor, out of nowhere, he just came to help these guys. The fact that none of the army men knew anything about the tides anywhere. The fact that presence of mind helps these people more than any crazy stunts or machine guns or brawn - like when Tommy decides to take the stretcher to get aboard the ship, when Farrier keeps track of fuel by asking Collins. The incident when the Dutch doesn't understand ""ballast"" and has to be told ""weight"". Just little things that were quite meticulous.

That's all that I can put together right now. I shall add more when I think of something else I forgot to jot down or someone brings up a good point. Let me know what you gleaned from it.",concernadian," TL;DR version de kake!  [removed] Well it's detailed all right.


The movie was shot wonderfully and just a delight to look at, but it felt mechanical and devoid of real tension. Christopher Nolan is overrated ",2017-09-20 16:12:16
Science/Technology,Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP],184,4i91ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4i91ig/kota_district_collectors_letter_to_the_parents_of/,40,"Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!

Science/Technology,Let's discuss the state of Indian intelligence agencies in terms of cyber power.,51,5kssg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5kssg6/lets_discuss_the_state_of_indian_intelligence/,30,"While almost every week there is a story or another about the NSA, CIA, GHCQ invading the privacy of the citizens, launching attacks against cyber criminals, putting people on certain _lists_ for using Tor etc.,  Indian intelligence agencies have been off the radar. I have a strong feeling that it's not because they choose to, but because they lack the skills.

Why do you think that is?  The NSA, SIS, GHCQ, FBI etc. make it a point to hire top security professionals and even hire interns directly from universities. The candidates selected consider it as a good career path, both in terms of serving the nation and in terms of intellectual satisfaction. Compare it with the state in India, where RAW and IB don't even have a dedicated website. I understand the need for secrecy, but at least have a fucking portfolio! One cannot even directly apply to RAW. One needs to join some other government department and then one gets transferred. (like seriously?). Just have a look at [NSA](https://www.intelligencecareers.gov/nsa/), [GHCQ](https://www.gchq-careers.co.uk/recruitment-process.html), [FBI] (http://www.fbiagentedu.org/careers/cyber-crimes/), [SIS](https://www.sis.gov.uk/science-and-technology.html) career websites and then look at Indian [IB's](http://mha.nic.in/vacancies) (No, there isn't even a webpage specific to IB and like I said, one cannot directly get into RAW). Would a person who is **actually** skilled even want to apply or work here? I don't think so.

I believe that India has not paid enough attention to strengthening its cyber power. I believe that we need to have some _Kevin Mitnick_ sort of personalities to wreak havoc on the cyber security front by unlawful activities. (Instead of fakers like Ankit Fadia). Why?

* There's huge money to be made in it.
* The Indian intelligence agencies won't be able to catch you (unskilled that I think they are).
* Even if they figure out you were behind it, you could easily hide in the 1.252 billion population that India has. 
* The infrastructure to attack is highly outdated and vulnerable (For instance [this](https://www.troyhunt.com/43-203-indian-patient-pathology-reports-were-left-publicly-exposed-by-health-solutions/).).

My worst fear is that if there is a war in the future, it will be a cyber war, and India will be left devastated. It's not that we don't have the skills, it's just that the government needs a slap on its face. Like seriously, our government needs to change. How can a few babulog sitting behind desks who have no clue about technology properly shape the laws concerning cyber security and privacy? Why can't our leaders debate about such technical issues during election campaigns (like Hillary and Trump did) ? They don't because they don't feel such issues are important enough. Like I said before, we need some big hacks to happen in order to stir things up.",PM_ME_YOUR_PU55Y_," >One cannot even directly apply to RAW.  

That's because you're not observant enough.  ""Cabinet Secretariat"" regularly gives ads for research and field officer positions in newspapers. Application is through GATE. Ever Heard of NTRO - National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) , that is the Cyber Espionage and Cyber Counter offensive wing of Indian Intelligence. Also India's Radio Research Center, is one such agency that has significant budget and surveillance capabilities. 

Both combined together have significant capabilities when it comes to Cyber Surveillance & continuous monitoring of web and mobile chatter,  almost all major Indian cities have significant land parcels hosting,  NTRO & RRO antennas, this is the Indian department that is always listening and analyzing data from all major telcos and ISPs.


Indian intelligence works more traditionally. where the focus is on under-advertising your capabilities and also major capabilities are spend in scoping out the opposition parties.

If you know where to look on Google Maps, you would be able to find major tracts of Lands dedicated to NTRO & RRO in New Delhi.  if you know where to read & look online,  you should be able to spot Indian state sponsored active botnets and presence. 

Though it may be less capable and intrusive as NSA, but India has its asses covered from the fear mongering that you just did, I believe, you can rest easy. abe kamse kam google kar liya kar. there is a good amount of information about mass surveillance in India.

Infact the telegraph act states that a telecom license can not be granted without having a backdoor access for the government.

remember the blackerry fiasco?
remember the satellite phone ban? and how only iridium devices on Tata networks are allowed in India? they have a listening post in Pune at the gateway.

[link1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_India)
 Forget our govt. even chinese phones are spying on you..
lenovo laptops,hp etc add backdoor in your digital devices.
your smartphone has tons of bloatwears which kils battries and spy on you some of them are installed as system app.
even lyf phones got a weird spying app.

how to save your ass?
r/privacy
don't use facebook if you really care about your privacy.
 This what they *want* you to think. India has a long history of playing the underdog. RAW for instance operated for years without the government even acknowledging its existence.

Even some light Googling will tell you about whispers of India's mass surveillance projects and how much tabs are being kept on communications. i mean the DRDO directly recruited from a friend's college (PES college in bangalore)- they judged via an internship. it was only open to top 3 people in the batch via grades (and recommended by the head)so they are hiring only the best I agree with everything you said, but first and foremost all of them needs to be put under the direct control of the Parliament. Intelligence agencies need to answer to the Republic (Parliament) rather than the PM/Ruling Party/Executive branch. I did always wonder why we don't have televised debates between candidates running for power. It's a very interesting way to check whether the candidate you're supporting or wish to support does align with your ideology. >I believe that India has not paid enough attention to strengthening its cyber power. I believe that we need to have some Kevin Mitnick sort of personalities to wreak havoc on the cyber security front by unlawful activities. (Instead of fakers like Ankit Fadia). Why?

It seems impossible to me that India can have personalities like Kevin Mitnick. The education system is largely to be blamed. Herds of people join B.Tech Engineering, learning all kinds of shit and end up in some company like TCS handling customers at Quantas or something like that. Even from childhood, children are not encouraged to explore anything. Just sit in a coaching center and chant ""FIITJEEans today, IITians tomorrow"". I wish people looked at [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz). He was given a computer when he was 3 years old, and he ran with it. [He became an idol for so many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ). 

Then there is our media houses. They fucking churn out crappy movies like Ra.one and Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and people run in hoards to....fuck it. Then there is Kapil Sharma's Show and Bigg Boss and endless saas-bahu serials. Indian TV is so frustrating to watch, one has to find solace in western shows. One good thing and that even banned (Torrenting). I have never seen a quality documentary produced in India. What would it take to start shows like '[Last Week Tonight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3530232)' or '[Vice](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2782710/)' in India? I know jack shit about my own country. I know nothing about its past or where we are heading. I came to know about Ramanujan's story from the movie, The Man Who Knew Infinity.  

Then there is the archaic institution of marriage. Fuck it.

>One cannot even directly apply to RAW.

My maternal uncle is in the army. Recently, I asked him, how can one get into intelligence agencies in India. His reply - ""RAW is an intelligence agency"". What in the bloody fuck am I supposed to do with that. Either he doesn't know it (which is pathetic) or its ""classified"". Conclusion - I don't know. I don't have the answers. I wonder who does.

Also, thankyou OP for this post. I don't see many posts like this one (relating to cyber security) on /r/India. Its refreshing.

About IndiaSpend:

IndiaSpend is the country’s first data journalism initiative. We use data to tell stories with the broader objective of improving the quality of public discourse. IndiaSpend was founded in late 2011 by Govindraj Ethiraj. IndiaSpend is increasingly an `agency of record’ when it comes to data and facts on the Indian economy, particularly in areas like education, healthcare, environment, energy and gender.

IndiaSpend is a non-profit and a project of The Spending & Policy Research Foundation located in Lower Parel in Mumbai, and registered as a Charitable Trust with the Charity Commissioner, Mumbai. 

Govindraj Ethiraj, Founder: He is a television & print journalist and also Founder of PING Digital Network, a next generation digital television initiative. He also anchors seasonal shows on Indian news television – the current one being the weekly `Policy Watch’ on public service broadcaster Rajya Sabha or RS TV. And most recent being BottomLine on Headlines Today – and writes for newspapers like Business Standard.

Previously, he was Founder-Editor in Chief of Bloomberg TV India. Prior to setting up Bloomberg TV India, he worked with Business Standard newspaper as Editor (New Media) with a specific mandate of integrating the newspaper’s news operations with its digital or web platform. He also spent around five years each with CNBC-TV18 & The Economic Times. He is a Fellow of The Aspen Institute, Colorado & a winner of the BMW Foundation Responsible Leadership Awards for 2014.

Samar Halarnkar, Editor: A journalist for 24 years working at publications like the Indian Express and India Today. His last assignment was Managing Editor of Hindustan Times, where he revamped the nationwide flow of news to focus on issues of public interest and ran groundbreaking investigations into poverty related multibillion-dollar subsidy programmes and administrative reform.

He continues as a columnist with Hindustan Times and Mint, writing on social and economic issues, science and technology. Most recently, he was a fellow with the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University, where he drew up a blueprint for mobile-phone-based, public-interest journalism model for India. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of California-Berkeley.

Halarnkar is the author of two books, “Nirvana under the rain tree”, an early chronicle of India’s Internet Revolution, and “A married man’s guide to creative cooking (and other dubious adventures)”, his experiments with cooking, which flowed out of a popular cooking column that he continues to write. He is married with a four-year-old daughter and lives in Bangalore.

",govindrajethiraj," Hi Govindraj and Samar. Thanks for doing this. 

I wanted to ask about this particular story IndiaSpend did on Delhi pollution which appeared in HT - [""Delhi’s pollution one-and-half times worse than Beijing""](http://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-pollution-one-and-half-times-worse-than-beijing/story-zGXWaA0sMG3nwTEeU59SaP.html). Apparently it was based on ONE data point in Delhi and ONE data point in Beijing.

> The analysis is based on a comparison of data generated by IndiaSpend’s #Breathe air quality monitoring sensor placed at RK Puram, Delhi with the one placed by the US government in its embassy at Beijing.

Don't you think the data analysis here is incomplete, and the headline is ""flawed"". The same flawed analysis was [picked up](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/beijing-pollution-smog-air-quality-environment-delhi-india-china-a6768611.html) by The Independent among others. [deleted] From painful experience - quality data sets on india are hard to come by. How (if at all) does this impact your work and what steps do you take to combat it.

Doesn't this limit the scope of DJ ?

What do you use/how do you guys clean and prep your data? Thank you all for your insightful questions and encouraging feedback...we will answer any further questions tomorrow morning by 10:00 AM IST [deleted] Hello! Thanks for doing this AMA  
1. What is one biggest misconception that you cleared, that you think is the most significant/interesting  
2.  What do you think of the current GDP calculation exercise?  
3. Do you have any suggestion to improve the way elections are reported and analysed?  
4. Which is the one area (in India ) where data journalism is needed the most?   
 Welcome! 

I'm sorry I can't articulate this question very well and I might be getting it all wrong, but - In your opinion in general, do you find that Indian systems of business commentary/think tanks/political commentary have started closely mirroring US structures? for eg. we see in US think tanks funded by special interest groups or with specific conservative or corporatist bents that produce analysis to the advantage of certain interests. do you see that happening in India too? Props for the #Breath initiative to monitor pollution levels in the country, its what inspired me and a friend to make [Earth Map](http://ocsidlab.github.io/earthmap/#4/21.15/79.08) on world environment day. Was very impressed to find open data and well documented APIs for this data. IndiaSpend is an awesome initiative! I hope other newspapers also follow the suit and do more data journalism. I do have some questions:

1) If I want to do data journalism, what is the path that you recommend, considering that I don't have any background in journalism, but I do work in the data analytics area.

2) Do you accept outside contributions for articles? Obviously after editorial review.

3) What tools do you guys use internally to do analysis?

4) Do you guys do any follow up research on the articles that you publish, and do some academic publishing?

5) Do you always use publicly available data sources like data.gov.in, or do you guys also file RTI requests?

Thanks for doing this, and in general for India Spend. Do you find any particular areas/sectors, in which getting relevant data is particularly hard? Really love IndiaSpend,

I really don't like the Indian Media as it is today, more sensationalism than substance, giving wide coverage to things that are not at all of national importance.

Indian Media should not be like 1st world country Media, because India is not 1st world country. Their priorities are different, while India faces massive 3rd world problems like Poverty, illiteracy, Malnutrition, quality Education, Urbanization etc., on a scale like no other country. Why does Mainstream Media cover Business so little when India is rapidly becoming a Market Economy.

Should media hold accountable on Policy issues with respective ministers and state Govt's rather than tit-for-tat silly politics, should Media work in nationalist interest because India faces such grave problems. what's your take on Media coverage of issues that's really matter. Are you hiring? Why is it named IndiaSpend? First of all thanks for doing this. I've read many of your pieces over the years and your data driven approach to journalism is quite refreshing in the present landscape. 

I have a few questions:

1. I'll be very honest. Most India spend articles I read are on other sites like Scroll etc. And I'm guessing they pick up stories which their editorial team thinks is the most relevant to their readers. Does cross publishing help readers discover your platform or is it harmful to the bottomline?


2. How difficult is it in our country to reach the masses with a purely data driven approach to journalism? Do you deliberately attempt to ""dumb down"" jargon or is that a strict no-no?


3. The risk with any data is that it can be interpreted variously by different people. Is it therefore difficult to maintain objectivity regarding conclusions you draw from data and how do you make sure that you stay away from ""I'm seeing what I want to see in the data"" kind of reportage? Really appreciate your efforts to clear up the ambiguity about lot of issues impacting us. 

1. What are some constructive ways your data has been used in?

2. What data surprised you the most and shattered common perceptions in that area? 


 First of all thanks for the wonderful initiative. I have 3 questions.  
1. How difficult to get right data as our system is not much supportive in collecting data ? What is the most difficult part ?  
2. How difficult is to remain unbiased while reporting issues ?  
3. Any particular case where the data based journalism has made major impact ?   I really have nothing worthwhile to ask at the moment(lots of good suggestions and questions already here) but i just want to say, *Thank You Guys* for what you are doing. Its appreciated immensely.

Science/Technology,History of India where Indus valley civilization survives and latter is conquered by vedic aryans,3,9b4xnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9b4xnx/history_of_india_where_indus_valley_civilization/,2,"Pre vedic age 1500 BC to 1000 BC
While the Rig Veda was composed in our time line during 1500 BC and was penned down during 1200 BC . The core philosophy of the rig Veda was formulated prior to 1500 BC and the scholars debate the exact time during which it was developed.While it is agreed that the core philosophy evolved during 1800-1600 BC . The rig vedas were written in vedic sanskrit which a closely related to the early avestan language.
While the rig Veda goes into details of the life lead by the vedic Aryans and contains hymns sung in praise of gods and some parts of rig vedas deal with philosophy and metaphysical matters

vedic Aryans in our time line left central Asia around 1800 BC well before Iranians left for Iran. While I don't want to get into the arguments of whether the vedic Aryans came directly from the andronovo culture or from andronovo to oxus river valley civilization and then to Hindu kush mountains and then to mordern day Greater Punjab and from there to the rest of India

But in this time line rig veda or any other is not composed during the 1500 BC but latter during 1000 BC . In our time line the vedic Aryans did not encounter any resistance when they settled down in mordern day Punjab as the remnants of the indus valley civilization had disappeared and only a few people resided in the Punjab. These people were absorbed by the vedic Aryans. While there was certain conflicts between the natives and the vedic Aryans and also the vedic Aryans and other indo Aryans tribes but not on the scale of Iranian tribes conflicts with Scythians, Elamite, urartu and neo Assyrian empire and also other people of the iranian plateau. These conflicts played a crucial role in the unification of various Iranian tribes .With the vedic Aryans the lack of serious threats resulted in conflicts between themselves eg bàttle of ten kings on the banks of the river Ravi.

Further since the collapse of indus valley civilization the urbanization in the Indian subcontinent received a huge set back since no major urbanization takes place till 500 BC and that's after a gap of nealy 1300 years from the collapse of indus valley civilization

In our time line The indus valley civilization collapsed in and around 1900 BC which was caused due to the change in the course of the indus river and also due to the change in the climate which occurred during that time period which caused the collpase of river valley civilization around the world and also caused the movement of various tribes including the vedic-aryans and the Iranian tribes . The collpàse was further accelerated because of civil war and diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis.

In this alternate time line the indus valley civilization survived though it initially suffered from the climatic changes and the change in the course of the indus river but it never had to suffer from the outbreaks of diseases and civil war . Thus the civilization survived and The people of this civilization adapted to the change and built new cities and settlements though the new settlement and cities were not in the size of the former cities and settlements But nonetheless the civilization survived and was recovering.
It was during 1700-1600bc that the vedic Aryans began to settle in and around the modern day Afghanistan in otl and by 1500 BC they vedic Aryans began their raids into the river valley civilization. Most of these raids were resisted and the vedic Aryans were driven back beyond the Khyber pass. The indus valley civilization at that point in time was made up of a single empire that sprung up from the times of trouble of 1900 BC . While much is not known about this empire but we know from the vedas that the empire was a centralised entity and worshipped false gods. The indus valley empire was able to defeat certain vedic Aryans tribes and Indo Aryan tribes and subjugate them. These tribes were made to pay tribute and in return the empire offered protection from other vedic Aryans tribes thus forming a effective buffer states.

This state of affairs continued till 1300 BC when the vedic Aryans in face of threats from migrating Iranian tribes and also from the pressure of the indus valley empire united under the leadership of Bharatha tribe . While this confederation intially did not cause a lot of trouble to the indus valley empire as the confederacy of vedic tribes were busy fighting Iranian and other indo Iranian tribes further north . These tribal war lasted for a century. While the vedic Aryans were not successful against the iranian tribes they were successful against other indo Iranian tribes further north and assimilated these tribes into vedic Fold further increasing in size and territories.

This increase in size caused concern to the indus valley emperor who sought to break the conferdacy up with tact and diplomacy and also by military campaign. It was during these times according to many scholars that major political changes took place in the vedic Aryans confederation. The vedic Aryans tribes over a period of time went from being nomadic pastorialist to settled farmers even though significant number of tribes were nomadic . The vedic Aryans were also influenced by the governance style of the indus valley empire and began to adopt the system of government of the indus valley empire. They aslo began to combine the elements of warfare practice of the indus valley empire with that of their own . Soon the vedic Aryans were strong enough to take on the indus valley empire.

In and around1200 BC the vedic Aryans tribes under the leadership of Bharatha tribe declared war on the indus valley empire on the ground that the empire was interfering with the internal affairs of the vedic Aryans tribes. At the time the vedas noted it was like an ant declaring war on an elephant. The empire though concerned did not make much of the threat and was thus ill prepared to deal with the new and powerful vedic Aryans

The vedas of this time line noted that this war lasted for 22 years but the major conflicts were decided in the first ten years and the last revolt of the subjugated empire occured in the 22 year after the war began . This leads us to a conclusion that the war was over by ten years and the rest of the 12 years the vedic Aryans spent the time putting down revolts

Consequences of the conquest of the indus valley empire on the vedic-aryans and history of the Indian subcontinent

A. Popularity of centralised state with a absolute monarch ruling a vast empire

Any person who has studied political science knows that vast empires create centralised state and favours absolute monarchy and vicea versa especially in a time before the advent of mordern day communication

In our time line the Bharatha merged with the puru tribe to create the powerful kuru kingdom in mordern day Pakistani Punjab but in this time line the merger does take place but there is no change on name as Bharathas in this time line were leaders of the vedic Aryan tribal confederation and as such name change is out of the question. While not much is known of the kings of the Bharatha tribe before 1200 BC but post 1200 BC there is a complete list of kings . While scholars of our time line and this time line agree that Bharatha tribe before it's meger with other tribes had a tribal council called sabha and samithi and it's society was egalitarian and democratic in nature but in this time line after the series of merger with other tribes and absorption of non Vedic Indo Aryan tribes and after assuming the leadership of the tribal confederation and more importantly the influence of the indus valley empire lead to creation of a new form of political structure ,the absolute kingship . While in our time line it was only around 500 BC that strong monarchical states emerged and it would take another two hundred years before the first empire known as the Nanda empire would emerge the same empire that Alexander the greats troops who were already de moralized refused to face the empire in war as it was said that Nanda empire had the largest and the most powerful army in the world but the concept of absolute kingship did not emerge with the nandas it was the Mauryan Empire the had the concept of absolute kingship and this evidenced by the hatered of the Maurays to the Mahajanapada and vice versa and also from Arthashastra

In this time line absolute kingship was known to the vedic Aryan tribes as it was followed by the indus valley empire and it's adoption by the vedic Aryans and the subsequent conquest of the indus valley civilization by the vedic Aryans caused a huge butterfly event . The concept of absolute monarchy much was unknown to the vedic Aryans is championed by them in this time line and this was the first major consequence and change from our time line. The consequences of this change are many folds . The obvious one is a centralised government is popular with the elites and the masses than in our time line. Further an absolute monarchy combined with a centralised state encourages unity and uniformity in political level and to some extent even in cultural level as religions in this time line in general and Hinduism in particular now champions the cause of absolute monarchy and a centralised state including large empires . Further with a history of centralised control and absolute monarchy creates an incentive for large empire because to achieve centralised control and to regin as an absolute monarch in a reasonable manner large empires are a pre requisite so instead of small to medium sized confederation that was characterized in our time line the history of India in this time line is characterized by strong authoritarian central government ruling a large empire

B Urbanization of the subcontinent

While in our timeline second wave of urbanization takes place around 500 BC but in this time line since the indus valley civilization survived and people continued to live in the 1052 or so urban settlement spread throughout the indus valley civilization at the time of its collapse in our time line. The vedic Aryans after conquest soon begin to adopt a urban life style and many more who are nomadic pastorialist settle down to become farmers in the indus valley whose population has been recovering since the times of trouble in the 1900 BC this massive influx of people from the west who begin to settle down and cultivate the fertile indus valley resulted in a revival of agriculture in the river valley not seen since the days of mature harappa civilization of our timeline

The indus valley civilization for all its advances in science and technology did not have much knowledge of irrigation system which in our time line was the main cause of its decline . While in this time line they did learn to irrigate the land and survive as a result their knowledge of irrigation was poor at best when compared to vedic Aryans who had good experiences and knowledge of irrigation systems as they irrigated the arid lands of central Asia during the middle bronze age . The vedic Aryans just like in our time line began to irrigate the land by building canals and small dams this brought in further lands under cultivation and made agriculture in the indus valley less dependent upon the unpredictable monsoon and increased the agricultural output from the land by many folds. This over a period of time lead to an increase in population of the indus valley but more importantly it resulted in further urbanization of the indus valley because of the surplus agricultural production. Thus the foundation of urbanization was secured
Further urbanization requires a strong central government as this was discussed in the previous point we can say the logical consequence of this that the central government will built new or renovate old cities to increase the control and to bring in further revenue in the form of taxes from industries ,trade and commerce
The retention of the knowledge and experience of the indus valley civilization has already been discussed in the beginning
These factors will cause an increase in the urbanization aswell as primitive industrialization which latter on spread throughout the sub continent

C Increase in foreign trade and consequently increase in the knowledge of foreign lands

While it may come as a surprise for many but the people of the indus valley civilization were proficient in conducting sea voyage and were experts in building rocks and ports . The best example of their proficiency is the docks and ports of lothal in present day indian state of Gujarat. While vedic Aryans who were not known much for their sea trade aswell as land trade . This resulted in the indian subcontinent being cutoff from the social and technological development of foreign lands as consequence of this isolation the social and economic and scientific development of the subcontinent was not shared with the foregin lands or it resulted in delayed or stunted development of the subcontinent in various areas .

An active foreign trade will have further accelerated impact on urbanisation as artisans and metal smiths and other industries have a much larger market to cater to and from the point of view of the government it will increase the amount of revenue in the form of taxes
In this time line the vedic Aryans because of the inhabitants of the indus valley civilization come into contact with Elamite, neo Babylonian empire, neo Assyrian empire, various Iranian tribes of the Iranian plateau and as a result of this contact apart from increase in prosperity as a result of foreign trade the people of the subcontinent also come into contact with foreign ideas and scientific development and the people of the middle East with that of India . While this will not cause huge butterfly effects in the political arena but the impact of this contact on religion and science and technology is not clear. There will be an increase in the speed of scientific and technological advances than what we see in our time line but in my opinion this will not result in major changes in the course of political and military events but rather a change in the standard of living of the people around the ancient world. To give an example by having contact with the people of the Iranian plateau who had advanced knowledge of irrigation systems the people of the subcontinent begin to use some of the irrigation techniques of the Iranians to improve the irrigation system of their own thereby increasing crop yields or using it to deliver water to the cities in a much more efficient manner

D. Socio religious changes

The indus valley civilization of our time had by the mature stage developed a very complex social heirrachy . While the details of this social order is not known in our time line and in this time line also the deatils are not known but the caste system that emerged in this time line may be same as that of the social order that prevailed in this alternate time line indus valley civilization but with certain changes. While this caste system is not as rigid as the caste system of our time line as it did allow individuals and communities to improve their status . It is a fact that the caste system in our time line was not rigid until the Gupta's lost power due to the invasion of hepthalites and during the islamic invasion of india this caste system further de generated into a ridiculously stupid system that emerged as a parallel power to the state authority but on the filp side it helped hindus preserve their customs and tradtion by locking them in a state of perpetual stagnation but in this time line the caste system will remain liberal when compared to our time line ,the reason for this is a strong central government and a Monotheistic religion combined with a high level of urbanization and industrial growth. Any person who studied indian history knows that when a strong Hindu state emerged the caste system always weakened and even during the zenith of caste rigidity that is during the 10th to 17th century the Monotheistic movements within hinduism emerged as the enemy of the caste system as the common doctrine of all these movements was all people are equal in the eyes of god as there is only one god we are his children. They stood against discrimination on the grounds of caste especilly the parctise of untouchability ( which in my opinon is kinda stupid) and had a common values and ethics system which kept them united and promoted group solidarity. In this time line as the form of government is centralised autocratic monarchy and the religion being Monotheistic the caste system is more like a class system and the practice of untouchability is never heard of and people of all social classes are given access to place of worship and other public places . Further in this time line the concepts of karma, papa, punya,janma , punar janma etc are present but they don't develop into a complex concepts which was used to justify the caste system as the concept of free will is more popular than vidhi or Brahma lipi or Fate in simple English fate ( but for non Indians reading this i do suggest that you google the concepts that I have written herein before and their impact on social development of indian subcontinent)

As I stated in the beginning the hinduism of this time line is MONOTHEISTIC and the hindus worship lord Brahma and regard fire as the image of Brahma and thus much like the zoroastrian people hindus in this time line also construct fire temples

The reason why hinduism in this time line borrows heavily from proto Zoroastrian ideas and beliefs is the fact that vedic sanskrit and early avestan language is very similar and since hindus of this time line are in more active contact with the Iranian tribes in the Iranian plateau which is the place where proto Zoroastrian religion was practised a lot of concepts of that religion makes its way to hinduism . While the gods of indus valley civilization are assimilated into the vedic Aryan religion as Demi gods

The reason why hinduism in this time line is Monotheistic and puts more emphasis on free will and good vs evil is because the birth place of hinduism or Brahmanism as it will be known in this time line is not limited to Punjab as it was the case in our time line but the whole of indus valley Afghanistan and Balochistan and further since the development of Vedas and other religious concepts are delayed because of the wars that the vedic Aryans fought with the Iranian tribes and other indo Aryans tribes and also the indus valley empire the vedic Aryans put more value in unity and order and the wars have a crucial impact on the society of the vedic Aryans in that the warriors and noble family establish their dominance over the priestly class as warrior are valued more than the intellectuals or people who recites hymns. Further since the place of development of hinduism is more extensive in geographical terms and is subject to foreign influence because of trade in this time line the vedic Aryans come into contact with proto Zoroastrian ideas of eastern Iranian plateau as vedic sanskrit and early avestan language are similar making it possible for the ideas of free will , good vs evils aand Monotheistic ideas to cross over from the Iranian plateau to the vedic Aryans tribes in the indus valley. What may also makes a cross over into hinduism is the concept of good and evil which has a similar concept in Hinduism of our time line as Dharma and Adharma but the concept of Dharma is much more complex than the concept of good and evil as the equivalent concept of Dharma is justice and the lord of justice is lord Yama the lord of the under world so if the concept of good and evil does make it into hinduism then it may become more mazadyasna than Brahmanism but in this time line hindus will still have the concept of Dharma and Adharma but since it is a Monotheistic religion in this time line the lord of the underworld and justice is also the lord of the universe that is the one and only God Brahma . So in this time line while the goal of moksha ( freedom from birth and rebirth) the ultimate goal of all hindus but the complex ideas of punya and papa will not be so dominant and makes its way to other concepts. In our time line the idea that deeds of a man in his previous life determined in which caste he was born in this life will not see the light of day in this time line as free will is the most important concept as God made every person capable of taking one's own decisions and if a person doesn't lead a life of righteousness he will be born again into the world . While the concept of heaven and hell is present , as a result of cross over from proto zoroasterian concepts with the concept of 7 janamas after which a person is judged for this deeds by the lord himself . Salvation or heaven or moksha means becoming one with the supreme being that is becoming a part of god ie Ahambrahmasmi which is a concept of Rigveda of our timeline remains a important concept in this time line also . As for hell well there is nothing much to say other than its hell.

While being Monotheistic the hinduism of this time line also has a concept of Demi gods that is souls of great individuals who on their death earn super natural powers but are not god . This is not a vedic Aryan concept and strictly speaking a Dravidian concept as is the case in our time line. Demi gods can be any person or an object or a natural formation such as an outstanding warrior , a great emperor, a great administrator, a mountain, a river , the sun etc while fire temples are not built for these Demi gods but shrines are build in their honour and prople evoke both the supreme being that is the Brahman and any of these Demi gods in their daily life . While intiallly any individual or object could have been raised to a status of Demi god if the people approve of it . But latter on in history the status of granting the status of Demi god became regulated by the Hindu religious order that is the clearical class of the Hindu faith interfered to preserve their power .

Being Monotheistic has an advantage of having simple religious practices unlike the complex religious practices that characterized the Hindu faith of our time line . The effect of this is there is no Buddhism or Jainism or any other counter religious movements as the main cause of all these movements is the pointless of the Hindu rituals and ceremonies whose meaning had become lost to time by then. A simpler religious ceremonies and better social system will ensure stability at the same time progress

The religious changes have been explained to some extent here and the evolution of Hinduism will be covered in other eras for example in the vedic period when the vedas are composed details of Vedas will be provided and in the changes during the Nanda empire era, the Greek invasion and the introduction of Hellenistic religion into the subcontinent and it's popularity in the indus valley and the Hindu Kush mountains, the Mauryan Empire era when the vedic hinduism reached its zenith , the civil war era when the challenge to the vedic orthodoxy became prominent, the Gupta empire era when the vedic Brahmanism was revived by the Gupta emperors some of whom were religious fanatics introduced the concept of forced conversions and religious persecution of certain religious movements, the prathihara empire which was more like a confederation than a empire they were tolerant towards the people of all faiths and it was during their watch that the Sassanian elite flee to India and the lands between khorasan and Hindu Kush mountains were absorbed, the shansabani the eastern Iranian tribes who in this time line remained Hindu it was during their regin the kings of India took the title shah Shahenshah ud Aryan ya anaryan, the various Turkic dynasty that ruled India from 1256 to 1730 the Turks in this time line some of whom convert to hinduism are usually tolerant in their outlook but some persecuted minority religion, the Maratha empire 1730 to 1905, the republic of India 1905 to present

The social structure

While not much is known about the social structure of the indus valley empire the vedas of this time line goes into depth as to how the new social structure came into being. The king of the Bharatha ,the king of kings of Aryans pratipa knew that the new subjects especially the elites will never reconcile with the vedic Aryans so he together with his samithi ( the elite of the vedic Aryans conferderation) formulated a plan to integrate their newly conquered lands into their empire. While intiallly they did not have plans of converting the people of the indus valley into their faith but latter on in 900 ad as brahmanism became powerful did religious conversion in the indus valley convert to brahmanism but even then majority retained their original faith . The vedas does make vague reference to the faith of the indus valley civilization. The faith described by vedas of this time line tells us that the people of the indus valley followed predominantly proto shaivism and shaktism while a significant minority also adhered to nature worship with host of other gods and goddesses. There were no temples or religious buildings where religious ceremonies were performed as all such ceremonies were performed in their houses or in outdoors.
The vedic Aryans flush in their victory engaged in rape and ,plunder of the inhabitants of the indus valley inhabitants and those particularly hit were the nobility as the military commanders of the vedic Aryans ordered their troops not to rape the ordinary inhabitants of the indus valley but it is documented in the vedas it self that the orders were disobeyed by a few but the orders did not cover plunder so as a result a lot of wealth was plundered from the ordinary citizens
.
The nobility and the family members of the army of the indus valley empire got the worst not only had they content with the death of their husbands fathers and brothers being slayed in the battle field now they had to put up with plunder and rape. It was this that came back to haunt pratipa ,the vedic Aryan emperor as he had to content with a hostile populace but king pratipa was a man of incredible intelligence while the plunder was going on the king emperor tried his best to ensure that no important members of the community are affected thus the traders, merchants, artisans, religious official, civil servants, engineers were safe and the merchandise of the traders were protected and this act of shrewed political calculation on the part of pratipa ensured that he wins the support of these prominent individuals who are essential to the running of the affairs once the dust has been settled .
The lands that once belonged to the indus valley nobility was confiscated and re distributed to the prominent individuals of the Indo Aryan tribes who happen to be prominent military commanders as well . While this does not lead to feudalism as only land is handed out not any legal or administrative powers and these new nobles are liable to pay taxes to the king emperor

The fate of these former noble families is tragic many were given away as wives to the elites of the vedic Aryans while the rest became peasants working in the lands that once belonged to them but some noble families who collaborated with the vedic Aryans were spared .
The caste system is as follows
1 These new land magnets formed the top caste of the society ,the fact that these families held prominent military rank aswell as vast tract of land gave them significant influence only next to the king emperor and his family in politics and latter on the top caste would also include top civil servants of the empire and the super rich of the society who were usually from the trading community and it was not unusual for these individuals and their families to be given the rank of nobility
2 The next in rank were the members of the military and the religious clergy and latter all the members of the civil service who are not belonging to the top rank and men of the books and science
3 The people in third place are the traders , merchants, metal smiths , tenants of the noble farmlands, peasant proprietor of the crown lands
4 The labour class
5 The slaves
While the details of the caste system will be dealt latter but for now let's get back to the indus valley
King emperor pratipa knew a revolt was only a matter of time so he began preparation to meet the revolt and also began to tàke steps to reduce the scale of the revolt
",proudman4lyfe," See, the problem with alt history is that in assuming that one particular thing is different, it sometimes forgets that a lot of the other things have to be different too. At the same time it tries to assume that too many other things would happen as if the change in question didnt happen

&#x200B;

Talking ""what if"" is difficult enough on a small time scale of a few years. When you try to talk about events from 2000 years ago, saying anything with any sense of certainty is foolish. 

&#x200B;

Take the following as an example: 

>The fate of these former noble families is tragic many were given away as wives to the elites of the vedic Aryans while the rest became peasants working in the lands that once belonged to them but some noble families who collaborated with the vedic Aryans were spared .

Why didnt all of them collaborate? Why wives of nobles in particular? Why doesnt whatever wealth they had due to being nobles, allow them to take up important roles in society? 

&#x200B;

I also have a bad tendency to dismiss any such fan fiction in regards to vedic times as something the hindutva types might tell each other to justify their victim complex.",2018-08-29 09:38:17
Science/Technology,[Serious] Seeking advice from r/India since most other places have foreigners who can not give proper answer,47,5rq4gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5rq4gj/serious_seeking_advice_from_rindia_since_most/,26,"Hello,

I am someone who wanted to do research for a living, physics specifically, but because of various circumstances was forced to do a bachelors degree in electronics and communications engineering in India. I had previously been in a markedly Western system and could not cope but was forced to finish the degree anyway. It took me 7 years to finish with reappear papers piling up over and over again and I am now 25 years old with a low undergraduate gpa (6.122/10). I am still interested in research but I don't know where to go now. I was hoping to do research in physics (and I still am) but after some discussions I may have to change things up a bit.

I've discussed a bit about what I've heard from reddit with my parents. As far as things go financially, I am pretty dependent on them. Now from the way the discussion went down last time, I get the feeling that they might be getting impatient what with me taking so long on my bachelor's already and from what they are letting on, I should either get into a program already or get a job soon. No preparation for exams or anything unless it is going to take 2-3 months or less. I don't know if that is enough time even if I were to study night and day. Besides, shouldn't I gain conceptual/research knowledge?

From the options I have gotten from Reddit, it basically boils down to mostly getting an MSc. I'd rather avoid doing it in India mostly because I am fed up with the educational system. People just learn how to parrot the textbook instead of actually becoming skilled in their chosen field but that may not be an option because of what I did. I pretty much just followed the curriculum. No extra curriculars/research experiences. Any practical laboratory work listed in my transcripts is pretty much on paper too. I mean it's not like I haven't handled a soldering rod, some circuitry, CROs and other small stuff but, then again, who hasn't? One redditor mentioned that because of this it may be easier to do MSc in India first, get research experience and attempting post baccalaureate courses to beef up my resume, then going abroad but as mentioned before, there is the issue of what my parents will and will not allow.

The problem comes due to the intervening periods. It doesn't help that my parents despite trying to act progressive are still limited by traditional thinking. I can't exactly blame them what with money being a relatively limited resource in our family and time passing by but that is not exactly helping with my long term plans. Due to this, theoretically, I cannot take the time off to prepare for exams for the universities such as JNU's physics MSc entrance exam or something nor will I be able to work on the post baccalaureate courses since they will take time AND money. Practically, I would probably have to work to find a job and as long as I don't find a job, I would keep preparing for the exams and what not but then I have to juggle that with trying to keep up with the knowledge required for the job that they will obviously test, if not outright rejecting me based on my grades, in some prelim exam and/or the interview. That or get a clerical job but I don't know if even that is possible because of the burgeoning population.

Now my first question to you guys is if some of the following fields might be easier to pursue research in. They may be somewhat related to both my bachelor's field as well as physics and I do have interest in them. I am not asking you guys to advise me about any of them but I am putting this out in case any of you know if it would be easier for me to go into research currently in any of those fields. Anyway, the fields are:

1. Quantum information science (computing, information theory, etc.) - Our field did involve conventional computing and information theory

2. Quantum devices/electronics, though I don't really much like the sound of this. I didn't realize there was a particular distinction between conventional electronics and quantum electronics. To my knowledge, standard electronics are based on our understanding of QM phenomena.

3. Photonics - Study of optical phenomena and derivative technologies such as optical waveguides, splitters, couplers, etc., was also focused on somewhat in my field

4. Photovoltaics/Renewable Energy Research in general - Photovoltaics is probably more the focus here. I put the second part there to emphasize my intention with research in it as well as tangential research interests.

5. Condensed Matter physics. This is more general than electronics so I don't expect it to be easier but just in case...

6. Physics of computers/information - not sure about this since it seems like it could fall into information theory

7. Dynamic systems theory (control theory, chaos theory, quantum chaos, etc.)/Study of Complex Systems - Our branch did have a lot to do with (mathematically) modelling various systems in many different ways, observing the effect of various inputs and feedbacks on the outputs.

My second question to everybody is, how would I accomodate my constraints, financial constraints being of particular note? Basically, I have to get into a program but seeing as that may be very unlikely, I may have to get a job instead. But I don't know if I can get anything other than a sub par clerical job with my degree and grades and I am not sure that would help me further my long term plans. To sum up, I am really confused about the next step to take. Please advise.",advic3s33k3r," Can't really help you with your first question regarding R&D in physics but: 

> how would I accomodate my constraints, financial constraints being of particular note? 

Have you ever looked into online tutoring? I know a few guys here who use a platform called Varsity Tutors to make side money but they will require SSN for background check so it's only applicable to US GC holders. I'm not sure what alternatives in India there are but you could look into that. 

If you can convince your parents, as money is an issue, I'd just finish MS in India or consider looking into options in Europe/Canada. Good luck! Can I ask which country are you planning to do your masters from?  You need to be bit more clear on your financial constraints.

If you do masters in India, like M Tech you would most likely be eligible for a stipend which help you to survive with an odd here or there but not your parents..IIT, IISC are good institutes for masters which will have way for research later in life...

If you are planning to take up research, unless it's in something like pharmacy your starting salary is bound to be limited initially, so need to be aware about that. 

You can also look for eligibility in newspaper for govt. postions for jr. Scientists and try to shape your carrier accordingly. >I am someone who wanted to do research for a living, physics specifically, but because of various circumstances was forced to do a bachelors degree in electronics and communications engineering in India.

Phunsukh Wangdu is that you?

 You are not going to receive funding from a US university in any of these research areas until you get a Masters degree from a top Indian university and graduate with either a stellar GPA or excellent research credentials with published papers in marquee journals. US universities, in general, do not look favorably on low undergrad GPAs. So you should first get into the best university you can, then find the lab in that university that has the best research output and then work in that as hard as you can. Keep an open mind about the exact field and look at getting experience. [removed] Donald Trump called,  he wants you to build him a wall. A wall of text. So I guess this thread has pretty much run its course but seeing how large it became (compared to how most of my other threads go...) I want to thank everybody for the time they took out to post here as well as all the upvotes this thread got so that everybody could see it. Thank you very much everybody.",2017-02-03 06:52:41

**India and Portugal sign 11 agreements: All you need to know about them** 

 ______ 
India and Portugal recently announced a four million euros joint fund to bolster research in science and technology as Prime Minister Narendra Modi held in-depth talks with his Portuguese counterpart on cooperation in areas like counter-terrorism, space, climate studies and start-ups.

In a joint address to the media after signing 11 bilateral agreements, Modi and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, who traces his origin to Goa, said the two countries have made substantial progress since Costa visited India in January.

The agreements signed included cooperation in outer space, double taxation avoidance, nano technology, improving cultural ties, youth and sports, higher education, scientific research, and setting up of a Portugal-India Business Hub and an Indian Chamber of Commerce.

Science/Technology,This is the Story of my relationship with religion - A Long Read!,21,6nu3gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6nu3gu/this_is_the_story_of_my_relationship_with/,12,"This is the Story of my relationship with religion:

I was in my 2nd Standard at an excellent Jesuit school in Ahmedabad when my class teacher Mrs Sinha asked “How many Hindus in this Class?”. It was for some Government count as far as I can remember. A majority of my classmates raised their hands. Then she asked “How many Muslims in this class?”, a few raised their hands. She proceeded to ask 1 or 2 more questions. I didn’t raise my hand at all. I didn’t know what those words meant, I didn’t know ‘what I was’. My bench partner on the day noticed this and complained at the end: “Ma’am, he didn’t raise his hand”. “What are you?”, Mrs. Sinha barked at me. “I don’t know”, I replied. She looked into my admission documents as I’d just joined that School and got back “You’re Muslim!”. That day I returned home and told my mother what happened. I asked her: “Mumma, what is Muslim?”, “It’s a name beta, we are Muslim”, she replied. That was how I discovered religion.


I was born & raised in an elite locality of Ahmedabad, which was predominantly Hindu but had a mix of a few others at the time. My first few years were spent in ‘Shri Krishna Apartments’ where out of 300-odd Apartments, we were the only Muslim family and this never became a problem with any neighbour ever. Our neighbours loved us and we loved them. Then in 1992, my grandparents’ home got burnt down in another mixed locality in Ahmedabad, right behind the famed IIM Ahmedabad. Some neighbours too came and joined in the loot, they were told. By this time, I had also learnt that my great-grandparents' home in the old city of Ahmedabad had been burnt a good 5-6 times over the years. Coming back to my immediate family, in 1992 our neighbours still stood by us but some people in the adjoining neighbourhood had noticed that we were Muslim and began threatening my parents to leave the place. They would wait outside our gate to threaten us when we passed. The builder of our Apartment - Kiran bhai stood by us and told us “Don’t you worry, I will deal with them”. But things kept building up. A few days later, when my father was driving his car, he was brought to a standstill thanks to a huge jam. It turned out that some BJP/VHP workers had stopped all cars and were climbing on the windshield of each to paint a Swastik. He was obviously shit scared but he stayed calm, waited for his turn to arrive, quietly got the swastik painted on his car too and then sped away like a madman.

On another scary night when rumours were growing of more riots brewing across Ahmedabad, we ran away to a family friend’s place. He taught at IIM Ahmedabad and my parents must’ve thought his on-campus-home would be a good place to hide at. Somewhere in the midst of our conversation with our hosts, loud noises from what seemed like a large group of people started coming from a distance. My parents were certain that a mob had entered IIM-A, maybe they’d heard about us hiding there. Our hosts too were obviously scared and the predicament we had put them in further troubled my parents. Then our host got an idea and said “Let me dial the watchman at the gate and ask where the mob has reached”. When he called, the watchman told him that the noise was from a Basketball match that was going on in the IIMA Campus.

Eventually things took a decisive turn. When we returned home one night, there was a paper stuck on our door, which said something on the lines of: “Last warning! Leave or else!”. That this had reached our doorstep was the last straw and my parents relented. Still, my mother was adamant that she does not want me to grow up in a ghetto and hence we moved to another mainstream locality, near the famed NID this time. Our lane was a mix of Hindus and Muslims at the time. One of the first neighbours we befriended was a lovely inter-religious couple - Indian Architects who studied in Paris. Their home in a similar Hindu-majority locality had just been attacked and they too had fled and come to this new place.

Although I was just four at the time, all these things made me further aware of Religion as a concept. As I grew up, often I was asked after a first introduction: Arastu??? Are you Parsi? First, I used to say “No, I’m Muslim”. As I grew up further, I would often lie: “Yes, I’m Parsi”. Sometimes I would say: “No no no no, I am Hindu!”. A few times when I dared to let it out: “No, I am Muslim”, I’d generally get a second response: “Oh! You don’t look Muslim”. Sometimes there would be no response but just a weird look on their face.

But regardless of whatever I said, I never felt as if I belonged to any religion. My family didn’t pray, we didn’t fast. The only time I would go to a mosque would be when my father used to take me on Eid mornings and I’d look around and rise, kneel and appear to murmur copying whatever others around me did. Post 1992, in the new Society we had moved to, gradually all Hindus moved out and it became a Muslim-only lane. So all of the boys used to gather, pray, fast and stand outside the mosque. But never me. They’d bully me from time to time, although my father’s hostility to everyone also contributed to that. I remember being bullied even for things such as wearing shorts! “Maulana says we shouldn’t wear shorts”, they’d say. “Maulana says we shouldn’t watch TV”. Sometimes when the Maulana from the nearby Madrasa used to drive by on his bicycle, they’d abandon the cricket match we were playing and hide inside the car parking waiting for the Maulana to pass. I’d be the only one still standing there wondering what just happened! We had two lovely dogs for a while and multiple complaints were made since dogs and their drool are considered unholy in Islam. I remember being called a ‘Kaafir’ and much more multiple times while growing up. My relationship with religion then could best be described as ‘indifferent’.

I remember two more instances during that period. One was when we had made a rare visit to one of our Muslim neighbour’s home and their daughter asked me to confirm the rumours she’d heard: “Tum namaz nahi padte?”, I said “Nahi”, she went on “Tumhe pata hai na ke 2 Jumme (Friday) tak namaz na pade toh Musalman nahi rehte”. My usually ultra-aggressive father too stunningly remained shut and just made an awkward face. 'Namaz nahi padhoge toh yeh hoga, aisi saza milegi, waisa gunaah chadega' - Have heard this umpteen times, yearned for someone to tell me what good it will do or at least expected them to tell me to pray out of gratitude and not fear but no one ever did, not one time. The second instance was when I got into a fight with a classmate from School over something on our Football ground. He came, pushed me to the ground and yelled: “Saale miye, ghar jala dunga tera”. I remember my first reaction to that being: ‘Shit, now the others too know I’m Muslim’. That fact had been considerably concealed otherwise because my name seemed secular (deliberately so, my mum had insisted I have that kind of a name) and my appearance or accent didn’t betray signs matching any stereotype people had in their heads either.

I don't remember seeing a Muslim girl in my lane after the age of around 10-12. They were either in burkhas or just indoors. I saw some of them the only time in their own weddings but there too, almost always, their faces and heads would be hidden. I remember another instance from this time. I have addressed my mother as ""Mumma"" my entire life, at times that ""Mumma"" would get abbreviated to ""Mu"" pronounced as ""Mo"" of ""Mother"". My school auto had come to pick me and as I came out, my mom waved goodbye and I said ""Bye mu"". A Muslim auto-mate laughed: ""Yeh toh Hinduyo ki tarah mummy ko 'Maa' bolta hai!"".

Then around 1998, I remember that one day when I heard that my best friend’s parents’ general store had been burnt down. There was no riot in the city, just a minor communal rumour somewhere and just that one shop had been burnt. I remember going to their rival’s store next door to buy something the next day. As I stood there, that shop-owner was speaking to another man and their conversation went on the lines of “You saw what I did!”, “Ya but I gave the Kerosene” came the reply.

Sometime around this, I discovered one day that my father, who had a habit of making powerful acquaintances had been communicating on inland letters with the then RSS chief K. S. Sudarshan. He used to keep some of those letters with him whenever a communal rumour flew around. Those letters would help him escape a potential mob he thought! Sudarshan called us one night for dinner to an RSS headquarter somewhere near Ahmedabad. We were escorted by a car, the time was around 8.30 PM when we reached. I remember walking past a group of about 20-30 stick-wielding men in Khaki chaddis practicing their drills, it was really scary for a child. As we walked in, Sudarshan was seated on a sofa in a reasonably austere room. 3-4 people sat around him. The first question we were asked was: “Aap ka ghar aur office kaha hai?”, my dad replied and two men got up and went to the other room, returning after a while. Till this day, it is my suspicion that none of our properties were ever targetted because of something those men noted down that night.

This became something that possibly helped us just a few years later. It was around 4.30 PM on the 27th of February 2002. I was about to leave for my tuition class when my mother called me from office. “Beta, don’t go, there’s some news of a riot, we too are returning home”. By then, I knew the drill, I cancelled all my plans and just stayed indoors. I remember my parents coming home soon after and us having a very interrupted half-sleep that night. When we woke up the next morning and stepped outside our ground-floor home, I could see thick, black smoke on 2-3 sides. One of those seemed to be from quite close by, could it be my father’s office building we suspected, as that was just at the next crossroads. Soon we heard from neighbours that every single Muslim establishment in that building had been burnt down except my father’s office. Maybe it was the note those two men made that night that helped, maybe it wasn’t.

The local TV Cable channels were playing ‘Gadar’ that day. Soon after, neighbours began gathering in the entire lane. Despite being raised by an abusive father, the tension I felt at that moment as a fourteen year old was new to me. I was scared for my life and that was because some people suddenly wanted to kill everyone who had the name I was born with! People around me were talking in a language I didn’t understand. There were talks about where we could run, who lived in what direction, people from what religion stayed in which neighbouring lanes. I had never felt more aware of my surroundings! Women and children were asked to go to the terraces to prepare kerosene bottles and throw them in case a mob attacked. Some of the more enterprising men said they will stand guard on both sides of our lane. ""Mob aa bhi gaya toh yeh aadmi kya kar lene waala hai!"" was the hushed response to that offer!

I remember my father trying to be brave and walking to one end of the lane that evening. He returned soon after and said he saw the now slain BJP Leader Haren Pandya leading a mob that was gathering at the crossroads just outside. It was many years later when my father happened to meet Mr Pandya when he told him: “Had I not been there that evening, your lane would have been burnt, I was trying to pacify the mob and steer them away”. But seeing that mob then obviously scared my father. In the meantime, my mother tried calling one family friend - A senior policeman. Always in the past, when we had called him in similar situations, he had immediately gotten a police point set up just outside. This time, to my mother’s astonishment, he replied: “Sorry, this time there’s nothing I can do”. My mother knew right then, this was different! After 10 years, it was now time for us to run again. 

That same inter-religious couple who were our first friends in the whole lane approached us saying that one of their friends leads the Police Academy, lives in the Muslim ghetto of Juhapura in Ahmedabad and has offered to host us in his farmhouse. Then we tried asking some families in our lane if they wanted to join because some space could have been arranged for them too. All of them said ‘No’. Some said they were worried about the black money, jewellery etc in their homes, some said they didn't want to run, some just didn't like my father. The police academy chief was smart, he made the watchmen outside his home wear police clothes and drive down to our home in his police car. We then rode in our car escorted by them and left our home yet again. I remember seeing this burning flame in a provision store owned by a Muslim uncle right outside our lane. I also remember seeing 2-3 mobs of 4-5 men on our way, all had trishuls in their hands, all wore saffron headbands. Suddenly this mystical area of ‘Juhapura’ seemed to be a saviour. 

I had never visited this area ever before. As we entered Juhapura, I remember someone in the car saying “Yeh border hai, hum aa gaye Juhapura”. The relief I felt entering a place I’d never been to still remains fresh in my mind.

I remember the next few nights. We stayed awake late into the night sitting on our host’s porch. We could see burning yellow lights (maybe flames) and hear loud noises and chants of mobs from 2-3 kms away, I discovered new practical laws of Science. The days would be no different. Every now and then black clouds of smoke could be seen in the distance and then it’d be a guessing game: “Woh Cargo Motors jala hoga”, “Woh so-and-so dukaan gayi hogi” and of course the phone too kept ringing. Gujarati newspapers too did their thing. I remember one popular Gujarati daily having a photo of a terrace taken from many terraces away with what seemed to be the vague figure of a man wearing something white having something in his hand and the following (translated) headline on their front page: “Who is this gun wielding Muslim?”. We returned to our home after a week or so, I was about to enter our door when one of our next-door neighbours saw us and screamed aloud: “Lo bhagode aa gaye vapas” (‘See, those who ran have returned’).

There had been no damage done to our lane but a few homes had been vandalized in the vicinity. One of them belonged to a school friend and classmate of mine, “One of the neighbours took our TV”, he told me much later. A few days after returning, I remember my mother speaking to a family-friend from our previous home - the one we had fled in 1992. She said they were so scared for their lives and even stopped going for their morning walks because they heard strong rumours of trucks full of Muslims coming to burn them from Juhapura. I think I almost laughed. I also remember how one night, many months later, when my father and I opened the door to the room where my mother was sleeping, she woke up startled, stood up and started howling at the top of her voice. She thought we were rioters who came to kill her. After pacifying her then, we eventually laughed it off over the years.

Two memories stand out additionally from this time. It was somewhere in March 2002 I think. We barely left home and everything seemed gloomy all the time. I got a call from a school classmate of mine inviting me to his birthday party. I couldn't understand his frame of mind and I think he couldn't understand mine. The second memory relates to yet another major change that happened in my life. My parents didn't feel comfortable sending me to my beloved School anymore as it was in a Hindu area. Remember this was March, final exam time was close and I was in my 9th grade. My father had a few calls with my school administration, they understood and gave me a promotion that year. For the next academic year, I was moved to another Jesuit school in the old city that had a healthy Muslim population. I have been asked several times why I made this strange move since the school I left was the one everyone wanted to go to, I have often cooked different stories up each time.

Soon after, my parents began working at riot relief camps. I remember my mother going to those camps quite often. I had been once, some NGO was getting kids there to draw. I remember this one girl having drawn a red haired monster. Soon my dad revived his old NGO and took it up full-time with my mother. I remember this one survey my father got conducted with some pedestrians around Ahmedabad. One of the questions was: “What do you think of Juhapura?"" (the same area we had escaped to). Some of the answers were: “It’s mini-Pakistan” to “There is a helipad there where helicopters from Pakistan bring missiles for war with India”. I also remember us stumbling upon these pamphlets from somewhere. They claimed to be published by the VHP/Bajrang Dal and their text in Gujarati read something on the lines of: ""These Muslim boys are very handsome and they fool and take away our Hindu girls later converting and marrying them. Let us open Gyms and beauty centers in Hindu areas too so that our boys too become handsome.""

Life moved on. Social activists began coming home, some film folk came too, there was lots of activity. An year later, mom and I finally left my father. Much later I discovered what had triggered that high a sense of empowerment and confidence within her after having been trodden upon for so long. She told me that in one of her visits to the relief camps, a woman came up to her and began howling: “Aap educated Muslim aurat hai, aap hamari haalat dekho, aap hamari madad nahi karenge toh kaun karega!”. 

That moment, she was liberated! The pain of 2002, the pain of that woman gave her a strange sense of empowerment. She realized that she did not need to bear anything, her pain wasn't the largest, she could be free, she could empower others too, she could still have a happy life!

Eventually she joined an iNGO and soon started the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (Some of you may know the name from the recent Haji Ali and Triple Talaq cases). I was fifteen when we left my father. Life became shockingly kind to me ever since I got out from those clutches. It was truly beautiful, I wasn’t good-for-nothing as I had been made to believe, I had skills too, I was liked too. After this ordeal, a lot of acquaintances too opened up to me on their respective domestic issues, I realized I wasn’t alone. After a period of selfish enjoyment to satiate my sense of being deprived, I became really passionate about empowering young people and started a non-profit. We worked for 6 years with about 6000 College youth educating them about issues such as Communalism, Gender, citizenship, even happiness.

I remember this one time when we took a group of Hindu youth from a mainstream College to Juhapura for an interaction with about 20 local girls from there. On the eve of our meeting, a lot of their parents warned them: “Are you sure you need to go?”, “Be careful, very bad people stay there” and so on. Most of them still came, we still went. That interaction was amongst the most beautiful moments I have ever experienced. These folks connected with those girls on so many levels. They were laughing, sharing anecdotes. Those girls said how they have never gone out of Juhapura, these youngsters shared how their problems seemed so much like their own. As we left, they hugged and invited each other to their respective social functions. The walls had been broken, at least for those 10-15 people we had taken that evening. I remember this other time when I took the same group to visit the worst-hit Naroda Patiya riot-victims. Every single victim, without exception, said: “Hindus aren’t the problem. There are good and bad people amongst both. This was the work of politics and politicians”.

On the opposite end, I remember this time when my grandfather came home one evening. Although he once prided himself on being irreligious, by this age he had a long beard and was always in a traditional white kurta-pyjama. He told my mother: “Beta yeh NGO ka kaam toh thik hai par Arastu ko bol thoda deen (religion) ka bhi kaam karey”. My mum replied: “Papa, aap ne jitna religion ka kaam apni zindagi mein kiya hai, us se zyada isne itni umar mein is NGO se kar liya hai”. I also remember how members of the Tablighi Jamaat would come to my home sometimes. Their job was to propagate Islam further and despite knowing I have never once prayed, fasted or gone to the neighbourhood mosque, they kept coming trying to patronize me into coming to the mosque. I remember one particular line said by an elite member of their group: “Aaj kal Musalman bachho ka dhyan bohot zyada Science aur Technology pe aa gaya hai. Woh sab toh theek hai par deen (religion) pe dhyan do pehle”.

As time passed, my mother finally met a kind, loving man and they got married. He happened to be a Brahmin Hindu. Interestingly, he devours Chicken and my mother loves Dosa. On my work front, things were moving at a decent pace. I was selected as Indian delegate to a Workshop in Bangkok, that was my first international trip. I remember this one time when I was walking through a flea-market and all of a sudden this cart full of hanging ducks and pigs came in front of me! I felt gross. That entire trip remained a struggle in terms of food. A fierce non-vegetarian back home, I struggled to find simple chicken to eat as there were all other kinds of animals there I found creepy. That moment, the whole Veg/non-veg debate back home, especially the religious flavour it is given in Gujarat, took a whole new turn in my head. It has nothing to do with religion or right or wrong I realized, it's just habit!

Soon after, the Public Affairs Unit of the American Embassy backed the NGO I was leading. Somewhere down the line they selected me for their International Visitor Leadership Program and sent me for a trip to the US. We were meeting with Senators and people from the UN and US Govt, we met iNGOs and more. Towards the end of the trip, I discovered that the introduction page that had been given to all the guests listed me as a “2002 riot survivor who was working with Muslim Youth on preventing them getting radicalized”. Everyone was nice to me, I was the star! It was ‘positive discrimination’. But that introduction couldn’t be further away from the truth, I was not a ‘riot survivor’, there were people who had lost people and property of their own, I hadn’t. And I wasn’t working with ‘Muslim Youth on preventing them getting radicalized’. I was in fact going to Colleges trying to educate Hindu Youth on communalism and more. I remember telling an American friend: “I don’t think I have been made to feel as Muslim in India as I have in America”. Towards the end of my trip, I remember calling my mother from America one night to tell her: “Mum I’m done, I’m leaving the non-profit world”, “Whatever you feel is best Beta!” she replied.

Moving on, I remember one thing an ex of mine used to tell me: “Tu Muslim nahi hai! Please! Maine keh diya bas!”. It made her more comfortable to think of me that way. Romantic relationships have started for me only after lengthy discussions on my religion, some didn't start at all because of the same and I am also aware that further intense struggles await me. I have also often been told “…par tu waisa nahi hai” after a barrage of insults about Muslims. I remember a friend of my girlfriend’s asking her during the planning of an outstation trip: “Yaar, can we go with a Muslim!”. I also remember that time when I was at an event in a College when students are supposed to be dressed by themes. I was wearing a turquoise Kurta and blue Jeans and this one student came up to me and asked: ""Tumhare group ki theme Al-Qaeda hai kya? Kurta pehena hai!!!"". To this day, I feel uncomfortable wearing a Kurta!

By this time in my life, I knew I was an atheist. Fiercely and irrevocably an atheist. I remember being on a trekking camp in Manali when some co-travellers asked me “Aap ka kya religion hai bhaiya?”, I said “Guess”. They tried everything from Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist, even 'Indian' and 'Human' but they couldn’t guess ‘Atheist’. I let it remain that way. I distinctly remember what one of them did when we returned to Ahmedabad. We got off the bus and were waiting for parents to come and pick everyone up. A boy kept nagging me: “Bhaiya, bolo na, kya religion hai aap ka?”, I kept playing around, avoiding. Soon after, his dad arrived. As he sat behind his father on his scooter and the scooter sped away, the boy turned around and screamed one last time: “BHAIYAAAA BOLO NAA KYA ANSWER HAIIII?????”.

Over the years, people in my family married Hindus, Christians, even a Dalit. I remember wearing a Sikh kada on my wrist out of some fascination I had once. I have kept a tiny Buddha statue in my pocket at times. There are idols of Hindu gods in my home that were gifted to me, there are gorgeous Madhubani artworks of Hindu lords we have, there is also a stunningly beautiful Janamaz (on which Muslims offer Namaz) in my home. I have been to many more temples in my life than to mosques, simply by not saying 'No' each time I've been on a tourist visit to a new place. Have accompanied people to temples and mosques when they asked me to, they would feel good they said and I didn’t mind!

Later, I started-up in 2012. I was the only founder out of the 3 co-founders who couldn't have his name on the office lease agreement, we wouldn’t have been allowed to get that place if I did. To this day, a lot of my Hindu friends in Ahmedabad have no clue about this long-lasting, cemented phenomenon and their shock never ceases to amaze me. Most 20 odd year olds today in at least Ahmedabad have hardly ever interacted with Muslims, because after 1992 and then 2002, most of the ghettoization is complete. Muslims escaped or were forced to leave to live only with Muslims and Hindus moved out to live only with Hindus. Pull up a map of Ahmedabad and I can show you exactly who lives where and there won't be more than a few countable exceptions. And not just Ahmedabad, my cousin in Bombay was made a product for TV debates on the one hand and right-wing trolling on the other when she expressed how it's been tough for her to get a home because of her religion. 

I also remember the time when one of my co-founders was warned by friends: “Be careful, you are about to get into business with a Miyabhai”.
After 9/11, plus lots of global terror attacks over the years and now Trump, I am sometimes told by friends ""Hey you have sometimes wanted to move to Silicon Valley, right? Do you think you will be allowed to now?"". Have had several debates with Muslim acquaintances online and offline about how killing innocents in the name of religion is plainly wrong and is also harming Islam itself! 'Islam isn't flawed, some of its practitioners are' has been a common answer. On a political note, ""Congress or BJP?"" has often been a question put up to me with a visible expectation of me saying the former. To this, a line I read somewhere on Facebook sums it up best: ""Main Musalman hu. Main marna nahi chahta. Is liye filhaal main corruption se kaam chala lunga"". 

After 2002, the Gaurav Yatras and more, a lot more got thrown my way but now it is made to seem as if it never happened. I remember this conversation a Gujarati Hindu gentleman was having with a curious non-Gujarati traveller in a train compartment I was sharing back in 2003. ""It was necessary to teach a lesson to these Muslims. They used to kill our Cows, they used to convert our daughters but now they are scared. Haan yeh aurato aur bachho ke saath thoda zyada ho gaya par overall theek hi hua."" When the other gentleman seemed to disagree and then went to the washroom, this guy told the others: ""Lagta hai Muslim hai!"".

Somewhere around last year, the Triple Talaq struggle my mother and her courageous colleagues were fighting for over 10 years picked up steam. Their interactions with tens of thousands of Muslim women across the Country had convinced them of the damage being propagated to women in the name of religion. That even the Quran - the holy book they all consider themselves reverent to, had no mention of Triple Talaq added further fervour to the fight. 

In response, hundreds of Muslim men, even some women would attack my mother and her colleagues at events, meetings, on TV debates. WhatsApp messages were broadcasted by the thousands about not just her but about her ""atheist son and Hindu husband"". Somewhere along the way Prime Minister Modi and the ruling BJP climbed onto the Triple Talaq bandwagon. Now those Muslims who felt threatened by my mother and her colleagues got a new weapon to target her with: “RSS Agent”. Life took a full turn, made a complete circle! And all of a sudden the same people we felt threatened by all our lives were being accused of being her friends and backers. Soon the political sloganeering and posturing died down but her struggle, their struggle continues and will keep doing so. Before writing this post, I called her to ask: ""Mumma, if I write a post about my relationship with religion, can it harm you or your work?"". ""Your thoughts are your own and they should absolutely be shared, fiercely and openly, don't you ever worry"" she replied instantaneously. The day I decided to drop my father's secular-sounding surname and use my mother's first name as my last name, I knew my identity shall become a lot more visible but it is too small a price to pay for the respect I want to give to her.

My latest tryst with religion was when I went to the #NotInMyName protest at Jantar Mantar just a few days back with my new employers/friends. Several innocent people had been lynched in the name of religion, this time the reason used was ‘Beef’. And then just a few days later, the terrorist attacks on innocent Hindu pilgrims on their way to Amarnath occurred and I remember the same old, familiar feeling coming back yet again!

Who am I fighting, who do I hate, they’re all the same regardless of their name or appearance, who is mine and who is the other, what is the solution, is there even one, is one religion the problem, are all religions the problem, is religion itself the problem, if religion didn’t exist wouldn’t the perpetrators just create something else to use!

Who do I belong to, do I belong to anyone, Who am I? But interestingly, the answer to these questions have been the clearest out of all the above. The others absolutely evade me.

Most of my good friends today are atheist or irreligious, most of them are scarred, most of them have stories of their own. I remain an observer to religion and this is an account of what all it has done to me so far! Let’s see what more you have to offer, dear Religion!

Courtesy: Arastu Zakia",modiusoperandi," Is this your own life story... Or fiction or Zakia's....?  All I will say is , thank you for sharing, it moved me. How many Muslims have KS Sudarshan or Haren Pandya on speed dial? So, accusations of being an RSS agent shouldn't be a complete surprise. And, these women organisations who were in forefront of Triple Talaq issue, where are they now? If not RSS agents, then they have been used by BJP and RSS for their political gains. I'm afraid Mr Arastu is yet another example of a relatively privileged person from Muslim background, who first has to prove to his readers why he is not a Muslim or very Muslim-lite, before talking about the injustices he personally faced or general anxiety he faces on account of some nouns or adjectives in his name. As a citizen of this country he shouldn't have to do that. It would be nice for people like him to talk about the meat of the matter for once directly. TL;DR pls :/",2017-07-18 00:18:43
Science/Technology,Can I get some career advice?,12,78mw0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/78mw0r/can_i_get_some_career_advice/,9,"I'm doing B.Tech in CS from a tier-3 college. Recently, companies have started coming in our colleges for campus recruitment and I have managed to secure a job in a mid-sized company at 4LPA(3.5 in-hand) but the problem is that the company is asking for a 3 years of bond agreement. Also, I got in touch with the employees and they told me that promotion is near impossible. That is the reason why I'm posting this here.

Now, although more companies paying higher salaries or offering better jobs will come to our campus, are there any other ways from which I can get a job? Hackerearth (suggested by someone) is a good place but all the hiring challenges require some industry experience. I've been told by my seniors to start using Linked-in and Angel to network and find jobs. I'm confused now about what should I be doing? Should I focus on competitive programming and problem solving skills, should I learn new technologies which I can show on my resume and/or build new projects.

I still have a semester left and I want to get as high-paying job as I can get to get to the 1.6LPM crowd. Also, I'm not in just for the money, I have interest in general computer science and I know programming, data-structures, algorithms, and my knowledge of hardware-software is, I believe, very good. However, my technology stack isn't good as the other guys in my college.",hashedout," Is the company located in Bangalore? Does the name start with m and end with usigma? Please no matter what don't get into a bond situation. I can understand that you might want a better job, etc. but bonds are like slave labor. You are currently in the top tier of people who even qualify for a decent job. Keep looking and I am sure you will find something better. Please don't get into a bond. 

I have been working in the IT industry for the past 12 years. The job scene is still decent due to the start-up scene. AngelList for the win. All my close friends have managed to get jobs from AngelList straight out of college. The good thing about these jobs is since they are not campus placements, almost none of them have bonds. First, ask how much do you have to pay in order to break the bond. If it is below 70k, then it is alright. Also, ask your seniors which technologies do the company work in. If it is comparatively new technology, then you can work there for like a year.

You will learn more while working in a company, getting into some decent projects, provided you are working on good technologies, not mainframe or excel or such.

I would say, take up the offer. Apply for better companies when they come. If you get selected in a better one, well and good. If not, you will still have the offer in hand. You will probably have a couple of months' period after you graduate and you actually start your work. You can learn things during that time. Then you can start your work, work hard, learn things on the way, then jump companies when you think you are ready. By that time, at least you will have some good projects and work experience to put up on your resume too.

Believe me, the off-campus scene is very very competitive once you graduate. You will find people who have interned in big companies all around. 

Work hard, try to get into good projects in the company. If you know any friends who work in big companies, you can always request them to refer you later on once you feel you are ready.",2017-10-25 18:50:23

Science/Technology,What is the Job Profile of a Technology Analyst at a well reputed bank?,30,6r2po1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6r2po1/what_is_the_job_profile_of_a_technology_analyst/,7,"I was recently offered a position of Technology Analyst at a well reputed multi national bank. What exactly does a Technology Analyst does? Anyone who is in the same position, how was the job experience? What does the growth in this position look like in a few years?




Ps: I am a Computer Science Engineer and a fresher. This is going to be my first job.




Thank you for replying.",hamsterNotSloth," Answering the question with another question. Why don't you email them and ask them directly? Best case,  the HR contact should be able to put you in touch with the team you are going to join. Worst case, status quo.  Hard to say Technology Analyst is a broad term - in my company help desk support guys are Technology Analyst, their job is to ask me if I've turned it off and turned it on again..    
   
but, in my previous company, Technology Analyst used to do testing when we were deploying software, then he would help trouble shoot and update back end config.    
   
And at my client Technology Analyst was a sort of a requirement gathering person, he used to draw flow charts and fill out paper work for solution developers.    
   
Which bank is it? Who does the role report to? How do you have a job and have not seen a job description?  A tech analyst at a bank can mean anything - if you're at an investment bank / boutique advisory firm, then perhaps you could be looking at analyzing the Tech sector for investments and funding and for doing due diligence - which would then feed into the work of the actual dealing I-Banker.

If it is at a firm such as Goldman / Morgan etc, it could mean that you're working in the IT Deptt of the firm, solving tech issues or building custom solutions for the firm.

Look at the JD and perhaps the kind of questions you were asked in the interview would point to what the role would entail - If it was about algorithms and Java - you can be more sure of the latter scenarios, else it would lean perhaps towards the former. In any case, look at the JD or ask for one if they haven't provided already. You should ask your HR if you still can , rather than asking here. That said , you'll mostly be working on configuring software and systems for the bank , and/or writing new software for some narrowed down function of the bank. I'd say it's pretty boring , and being a compsci fresher , there are ""better"" places for you. Why are you even considering the role when you don't have clarity. Ask HR about this BEFORE you sign on anything. Also ask th about career growth path and opportunities  Why is this tagged demonetization",2017-08-02 15:59:17

Moreover, I have developed cervical pain and think that I cant continue a career that requires me to sit in front of the computer all the time.

On the other hand, I have become more and more interested in the wider currents of the world covered in the social sciences like political economy or philosophy.

Text from the release,

**Cabinet grants ‘in-principle’ approval to the LIGO-India mega science proposal** 

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ‘in principle’ approval to the LIGO-India mega science proposal for research on gravitational waves. The proposal, known as LIGO-India project (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory in India) is piloted by Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Science and Technology (DST). The approval coincides with the historic detection of gravitational waves a few days ago that opened up of a new window on the universe to unravel some of its greatest mysteries. 

The LIGO-India project will establish a state-of-the-art gravitational wave observatory in India in collaboration with the LIGO Laboratory in the U.S. run by Caltech and MIT. 

The project will bring unprecedented opportunities for scientists and engineers to dig deeper into the realm of gravitational wave and take global leadership in this new astronomical frontier. 

LIGO-India will also bring considerable opportunities in cutting edge technology for the Indian industry which will be engaged in the construction of eight kilometre long beam tube at ultra-high vacuum on a levelled terrain. 

The project will motivate Indian students and young scientists to explore newer frontiers of knowledge, and will add further impetus to scientific research in the country.
