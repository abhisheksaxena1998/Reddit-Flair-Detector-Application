What's your story?    

P.S - The `AskIndia` flair ain't working mods.",__knockknockturnal__," Someone matched with me just to tell me that I'm fat. Cat 1:- General ""Follow me"" influencers + Bots, nearly same thing.

Cat 2:- Girls looking out for validation atmost.

Cat 3:- Looking out for true love on Tinder or maybe comfortable future, who knows. Doesn't know any good man in thirsty as fuck society like ours.

Cat 4:- Past-the-wall Aunties. Too cumbersome to filter out + prefer foreigners, I don't blame them. Lack of matches I used Tinder on and off when I was in India, Bumble not so much. Went out on 3-4 dates and matched with decent number of women. This is over 2 years so no achievement.

I don't use them now. Reason being that I feel that most women over there are just killing time. And I can understand why. In a country like India where the dating scene is quite imbalanced women don't need apps to go out on dates. Especially when India isn't a safe country for women too. 

Not to mention if you're an average looking guy the odds aren't in your favour. So I have to make conversations with so many women which don't go anywhere and it just gets tiring. Most of the times it is obvious that the girls never had an intention of meeting.

Also I feel that dating apps usually attract lazy people. I am myself lazy and I don't have the energy to go out and socialize and try meeting women. So I try to swipe left and write sitting on my sofa in the hope of getting a date. I feel the same applies to women. The girls on Tinder, more often than not are too lazy, undecided or uninterested in taking any action. I had used Tinder in US for only 2-3 days while on a trip, got good matches. Not a single match in India in 2-3 years. I don't use it regularly though, one or two times in a couple of months.

And Indian Tinder is filled with fake profiles and who-knows-what-they-think pictures (at least in my location), I have to swipe left on like 10 profiles to come across 1 genuine profile, and still no match! Is it just me who read the first word wrongly ? -What made me stop ?


-Marriage I don't know. People aren't 'real' on there. Girls hide 75% of their face/body and when you meet them it's like ""Woah who tf are you?"". Most girls just want to feel better that someone prefers them. I haven’t stopped, I just use it less often these days cause work is mad hectic right now.

Bumble and hinge work well for me. Tinder is shit, it’s pretty much become pay to use/get seen ( at least for dudes).",2020-03-15 18:48:06

About 8 years in, he quit his foreign bank job to focus entirely on music. He played with marquee players but his 'contribution' to the overall music is much lesser than what he is capable of. He got comfortable. Music has its own politics, its own power plays, and one has to learn to compromise but also be able to speak up for oneself.

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

AskIndia,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",13,bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,27,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",FrustratedOCIHopeful," Honestly, she and her supervisor behaved *exactly* how most of our government officers behave with residents of India. Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? 

Even if she isn’t lying, it’s worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this. You'd think these people would adapt to the local work culture/ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals, which shouldn't be the case.

&#x200B;

Please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs:  [https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)

make sure it's public and that her twitter is tagged in your post. She is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty. Do keep us posted about things you did for this issue. If it is just for a visit, apply for a regular visa. You can always visit India as a tourist. As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.

as an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  ""We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)"" r/iamverysmart individuals.  
moreover, if any of the official encounters technical problems - it is impossible for them to say ""cannot be done because of bad mood"".

But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",fenocs," It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn’t find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

AskIndia,Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,52,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",JaJH," You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!",2019-04-18 22:43:12
AskIndia,What is 'Gotra'?,37,a2nsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2nsgt/what_is_gotra/,32,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)",ab370a1d," In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

 Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.

Gotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.

Source: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':

&#x200B;

*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*

>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.

>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.

I'm British and would like to learn more about Indian history, but most of the most prominent scholarship on the subject in the UK has come from non-Indian Brits, and often comes with particular biases (particularly regarding British colonialism). I'd therefore appreciate it if anyone can point me towards good written histories of the country by Indian scholars.

For the history of British colonialism in India I've started with Shashi Tharoor's *Inglorious Empire*, but of course there's a lot more to India's genesis than British imperialism.

AskIndia,European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,29,968di3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/968di3/european_looking_for_opinions_from_indians/,67,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. ",PsychoPass1," Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.

The sooner you get out, the better it is for you.

I would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. 

If there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.

Now man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.

Don't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.

The responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. 

No matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  

So good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  
You just run smack into it. 

She’s just like the majority.

(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....

Unlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.
On a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to

Hurt her family's standings
Cause her family grief and pain
Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.... 


The ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. 

On the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. 

Please think twice before you proceed. 
Some Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. 

Her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. 

 grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!

I hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. 

In the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities. 

This would be a harsh test of her character and your patience, but I hope you guys come through. Please keep us updated  Move on and break up with her . Help info : where s her family located  ? What is her caste ? If she not willing to STAND UP TO HER PARENTS!!! LET IT GO

Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",2017-05-15 21:21:16
AskIndia,Who should I vote for in 2019 General Elections?,8,63l6vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63l6vm/who_should_i_vote_for_in_2019_general_elections/,50,"Even though I was eligible to vote back in 2014, I was out-of-station during the elections and couldn't be back home in time to vote. I have never voted till now due to similar circumstances. 

Back when UPA I and II were in power, the obvious choice was BJP or its allies. But now that their true colours and agenda are out, my conscience wouldn't allow me to vote for them.

AAP is out of the question as Kejriwal has demonstrated his greed and hunger for power again and again. He keeps allying himself with all the wrong parties in order to protest against whichever the incumbent is.

I will never vote for INC until they change their top leadership and overhaul the party structure as a pro-development secular party with centrist policies.

Who do I vote for?

BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them. 

Are there any good candidate/parties that are not affiliated to the Sangh Parivar/RSS/VHP?

If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state. 

I wish to see India as an educated, liberal and inclusive country that keeps religion out of its government.


**EDIT:** *Should I flair it under Politics or AskIndia?*",concernedindianguy," Founders of Indian democracy did not create a model where you vote for a party or the PM candidate. Just because you like Modi/Raga/Kejriwal does not mean all candidates of the respective parties are good. What most people don't realize is by voting for a 'PM' candidate, they are actually destroying the spirit of democracy. 

For general elections, research local candidates all of parties. Find a candidate who is honest, hardworking and has a history of doing good work and raising issues that matter to you. If you blindly vote for a party because you support their PM candidate then you may get a local MP who is useless and will not contribute anything in development on your region. 

EDIT: Typo > BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them.





NOTA. Look at your MP candidates and vote for the best one irrespective of their party... [deleted] Simply don't vote. The current version of NOTA is a joke on us. So not voting is the better option. Doesn't matter    

#EVM ==> Every Vote for Modi NOTA. I know it is useless, but I have to register my dissatisfaction with the quality of options given to us. Ask after 2 years.  I'm voting for AAP because I want to see what that insane man does. India has survived 60 years of Congress and nearly 3 years of BJP. I'm sure it'll survive a Kejriwal.  > If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state.

u lost me here.  [deleted] For me, it's gonna be anything but BJP. They have become too arrogant. Do you have any regional parties prevalent in your state? I'm from Hyderabad so I guess I could vote for TRS. They've been doing great work.  Vote for Priyanka Gandhi if she is next PM candidate  I'll probably try AAP now I suppose. Tried INC -> Didn't work. Tried BJP -> They've done some good IMO, but as of now, they are super distracted. So the only party that is even trying is AAP, so I suppose that gets my vote.

Honestly the demographic dividend problem (and resource) is a very big one that can make or break the country's future. And nothing but a fully-focused push can achieve anything. Even then, it might be far too little , too late, but I'm always a hopeful man, so I'll still believe. But time is running very very low for things to be in place (as is India, we are already way past deadlines), but lets see what happens. [deleted] BJP , there simply isn't an alternative ! If you need to ask others who you should vote for, I think you are an uninformed voter and should refrain from voting. A better idea would be to make yourself informed and decide for yourself.

I personally will probably vote for INC, unless a better alternative comes up, but you should make your decision yourself.",2017-04-05 20:24:57

Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

I know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

PS: I posted this in r/AskIndia already but couldn't get many answers. Hope this post gains more attention this time.",throw_for_bea," Even though your post is very long, the job you are thinking of switching to is not mentioned properly. Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? 

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not. Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad history Just be honest and upfront. Why hide?. 

Say I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

Why complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. 

I don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job. And will you have clear free mind answering questions constructively instead of having something back of your mind like what if they find, what should I tell etc etc.",2018-08-26 21:53:51
AskIndia,"So I am writing a book, titled ironically ""Letters from your BFF"" in response to Nikita Singh's ""Letters to my ex"".",3,9b5g5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9b5g5p/so_i_am_writing_a_book_titled_ironically_letters/,4,"Hey everyone, I have flaired the post AskIndia, because I am seeking a conversation about absurdities of relationships and interpersonal friendships in today's world. 

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally.

This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.

to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week.

I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",ringtring," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  ",2017-04-22 12:19:09

AskIndia,PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,47,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

AskIndia,Buying an apartment in Hyderabad,3,8dg2ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dg2ih/buying_an_apartment_in_hyderabad/,4,"Hi everyone,
I am planning to buy an apartment in Hafeezpet. The total amount is 47 lakhs for ~1100 Sqft near main road. Is this normal price? I am not so keen on buying but my parents in India are adamant about it. Rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance. Planning to take a loan for 30 Lakhs and use cash 20 Lakhs.

Edit: I don't know why I am getting downvoted :( I just asked a question with the AskIndia flair!",mdocvar," When you said “Parents in India” I am assuming you are abroad. Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn’t . I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought...... Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

  You can also check out r/indiaInvestments ask the same thing there maybe those guys could be of more help.

AskIndia,Well articulated anti congress Whatsapp forward. Bhakton ki nayi [p]eshkash,2,7zckca,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7zckca/well_articulated_anti_congress_whatsapp_forward/,5,"


Received on the family whatsapp group

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

I received this message. I want you to read and think about it. I am forwarding for that purpose""

",Bikihuigormint," BJP has learnt a lot from the humble onion, narratives on narratives and the core, nothing. > Nobody gave India confidence! 

Playing with people's insecurities. Not getting any women. Use this Axe deodorant and women will flock to you.

Did congress do nothing to give confidence to Indian people? When congress came to power it denotified the tribes which had so far been classified as criminal tribes. By recognizing their humanity, and by giving them an equal opportunity did it not give them confidence. What about the right to vote given to women and outcasts? Was it not ahistoric in the region. And the states which were created on linguistic basis. 

> MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

It was exactly opposite. Gandhism is a method to uphold the humanity and moral standards of the victims. 

> Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. 

When congress came to power, one of the first thing it did was to abolish zamindari system. Then it gave voice and entitlements to outcasts. 

> Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Dynamism of British period? Are sanghis missing their 'golden age' under white masters?

> people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered

People were not waiting for alms. People were poor and starving. Some folks have forgotten how poor India was and still it. Should congress have allowed them to die like China did? Is taking care of starving people and empowering them mutually exclusive? Can you not do both at the same time? Was it not something congress did?


> India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. 

NRI's guilt. 

 
 FFS all these chutiyas complaining about India's ""weakness and impotence"" are so clearly projecting their own shortcomings.

India managed to stay ""non-aligned"" under severe pressure from both US and USSR under Nehru. We were able to stave off handing over economy to the World Bank and IMF for as long as we could and when he opened up, we did it on our terms. We engaged in 4 wars and came out on top in at least 3.

We lifted more people out of poverty than any other country except China and corrected social injustices like untouchability which had existed for centuries.

And all of this while being a functional democracy, empowering civic institutions and fostering an inclusive multilingual, multicultural society.

How on earth - can someone say that is weak? If your family thinks this is any sort of accurate or well articulated I fear for their intelligence. Just a hypocritical NRI bhakt ranting about things he is  too lazy and selfish to change himself.  So many similarities between our new dumb entitled middle class and the hypocritical nationalist nris.",2018-02-22 13:43:35
AskIndia,[Modpost] New Flairs for /r/India and Improving Discussions on /r/India,74,3de8cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3de8cn/modpost_new_flairs_for_rindia_and_improving/,234,"Hello folks!

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)
",r_india_mod," Could you improve wiki? Many times a post/comment is removed citing some non-existent rule. And you don't allow to make meta post about it. Which I can understand because you don't want drama. You ask to send mod mail. We send but then you don't reply to mod mails too. 

* Remove politics from this sub. Like /r/unitedkingdom has /r/ukpolitics, /r/canada has /r/CanadaPolitics, /r/australia has /r/AustralianPolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in /r/indianpolitics. It will improve this sub.

* Make things transparent. /r/Futurology has /r/FuturologyModerators/ and /r/FuturologyRemovals/ where removed things are recorded WITH reason. /r/technology has has their automod configuration public /r/technology/wiki/automoderator. Use a meta sub to which allows easier communication and discussions. Case in point /r/metacanada 

* Add this post and other mod announcement posts in the /r/india wiki.  [deleted] >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

If I have to explain my meme or image in a self-post it is kind of counter intuitive, no? 

I mean, a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words. My two bits:

* Remove the political post/politics altogether from this sub.

 our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day. And since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do so.
You can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like /r/indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did , if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they don't comply then ban them from this sub(not shadowban,let them know why they are banned).

*  I'd suggest some flairs like **arts, sports and religion**. More flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably won't downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people. +1 for no political twitter spam > Remove low-effort political self-posts

Please elaborate on this?

Also, you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process. >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

I don't think this serves any purpose at all. The reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for OPs to score cool karma points, but to reinforce his/her own political views. So self post or not, these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed. 

>Remove low-effort political self-posts.

You will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions.  Since there is an announcement, I want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here.  These are tangentially related.             
Does this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? Is it a place for discussion only or reddit India supported activism?  For example Net neutrality debate. I think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl. It encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices.          
I think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like NN which lead to brigading in real life.  Shouldn't have happened.            
Second, do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? And is there a criteria. I  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted. I  see that as an encouragement. 
 Ooh.. common account as a mod.. 

*interesting*

Governance flair sounds good. Hopefully we'll have more discussions on that.
 How about a flair to seperate the faking news/unreal times articles from the real news. > Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Yes and yes. >but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this.

Any other conditions? Wheeee flairs!!   
TIL, LPT/jugaad, ELI 5, ITAP, TOMT, throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop.     

But can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion?     
 [removed] You people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didn't work. Politics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard.  [removed] Having to explain memes kind of spoil the fun. And that also kind of deters the content makes (Who am I kidding, no randian makes original content). Even then, atleast its possible in the future. Aand thats how you make a dead sub...btw instead of these useless flairs why not make a ""Delhi"" flair to filter it out all the useless AAP posts. I have a moderation related questions.   

When Moderators delete a post, I have seen 3 kinds of things happening.

1. A comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   
2. A [deleted] message appear on the self post    
3. Sometimes neither of the 2 happen, but the post still disappears.    

So what's the difference? Why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?   
 Add a flair for geopolitics.  AskIndia is good but I don't think Governance flair would be used often. Rather, have a Weekly flair for regular posts. Another suggestion, have a BJP/AAP/Congress flair along with Political. A lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties.  Rules rules and more rules....At this rate One day you will have to delete all political posts and move it r/IndianPolitics  > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. 

no direct submission to posts made by verified twitter handles makes no sense. make this rule about unverified twitter handles.

verified twitter handles serve as news source, and you have policy of not editing the news headlines, but you want users to editorialize  the 140 character twitter posts. That defeats the purpose of twitter, as a platform.

 Please could you add a crime flair. We get quite a few of those posts, and one for the counselling needed type relationship posts.

How do you define low-effort political self posts? Also what about low-effort political comments in political posts? Can you guys have the automod say which words are censored from the sub so that when my comments get deleted I can remove the offensive words? Thx Mods can you bring back the weekly movies thread

They were being done earlier but then were disbanded dues to lack of popularity after some time

Now with the whole make /r/india better thing going on

I think it would be good time to bring them back, and see how they work now

Plus it would also increase semi-Original Content and NP posts

Maybe stickie those threads early on Whenever we have one of these posts, it is followed by another list of new rules. Can we just let things be for a while?  Please bring up new ways to help new redditers  [deleted] IMHO, you guys need to cut down on your stupid rules, instead of making shitty new ones. 

You guys remind me of the following story:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey I can pitch in as mod and help out if you guys are okay with that. 

Edit: just saw the comment by the mods regarding signing up. Will modmail.  - Regarding ""no direct submission to images"" for [P] posts, could you please clarify the reasoning behind this idea? Doing away with memes and ""caption this"" makes sense, but why all images? For example, would an image of a politician slapping someone not be relevant content which would not require any further explanation? Additionally, if you do decide to go ahead with it, why just images and not audio/video?

- Could you clarify what a ""low-effort"" political self-post would be? Would all such content need to be backed up by data or are opinion pieces also allowed? If data is to be made mandatory, how would you plan to make sure that the content isn't an op piece with some data just for the sake of sticking to the rules? [deleted] ""Governance"" flair is an interesting idea. Not sure how much traction it will get but it's worth a shot. There is a very urgent need to separate political bullshit and rhetoric from actual impactful decisions that political parties are taking.  I am very against these ideas of writing essay for self posts. I have already expressed my opinion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3d8epc/is_noise_drowning_out_the_signal_in_rindia/ct2to3p):

> and low-effort content is always upvoted to the top

subjective. people upvote what they like

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.
> 
> No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.

it's censorship. mods shouldn't decide what is 'low-effort' and what is not. the members of community should.

and not everyone wants to read a essay about why submitted an image of some tweet. 

>  /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards.

People like it. Let them decide what they want by uproots/downvotes.

 We need more flairs. Arts, Movies, Books, TV, etc etc. 

We need weekly threads for different topics. Can we automate this please?  Be more strict with with titles which are unverified and misleading. I see them not tagged Wrt flairs.

Try and choose a flair which is a unique set with minimal Overlap and a topic obvious from the name.

So for example governance could be policy. Entertainment I think would be too broad.

Sports is a good choice. I think DIY maybe of value. Ask is another option.  Please take care of posts which are low effort under political flair. Don't let them shitpost. For example like today 

Really low effort & shit post

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlxn8/proof_that_rss_is_literally_hitler/

One line statements from Twitter which creates cicrle-jerk

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlo0y/tell_narendramodi_to_remove_his_paramilitary_from/

Rather ask such people to make self posts or wait till any media house writes a full article on this. What is the point in creating multiple threads due to just one comment from any politician?

As we are growing, we are lacking space on the front page, news & politics keep on clogging up that space.

Please don't resent anything & be harsh on these assholes. You have my vote on this.

Please bring more flairs other than AskIndia/HelpIndia like Sports & Entertainment. Please have more weekly threads like those tech threads & also sticky those threads so more people comment. Thanks for taking the initiative, the new flairs sound like a good idea, implementing them, a far bigger proposition, but doable!!    
>Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced         

This needs to be done. I know it is a big task for the mods, but its the need of the hour! You can find people who are actually driven to do this, and if implemented,along with removal of low effort self posts, will be a welcome respite, and greatly improve the quality of political discourse in the sub.    

Again thanks for trying to bring about a change and I wish you guys all the luck to go through with it. you'll need it :) Could we limit the posts with personal questions and rants? They're almost always unverified, troll bait and conform to the subs circlejerks.

I'd love to see more moderation of those posts than deleting ""Chaddis vs AAPtards"" kind of comments. The latter get downvoted pretty often, anyway. Could you post some guidelines about downvoting that people will see more prominently when they are about to downvote?

Right now whenever someone sees something they don't agree with, it is downvoted to oblivion and it fosters a kind of circlejerk where you only see the majority opinion and anything that disagrees just disappears.

Other options might include keeping the threads in contest mode for a longer time. I used to avoid /r/India like the plague, but now I'm starting to see a lot of intriguing discussions. I still disagree with some people, but we are able to discuss in a logical and informed manner, as opposed to the childish, irrational, and chauvinist way people were a while back.

Re-subscribed. 1. Strictly objective rules. Remove all subjective interpretation from rules. This continues the situation of ""we have fallen short"" remark. When there is no objectivity, two people can have a different opinion about the same comment, and then a rule ceases to be a rule and becomes an opinion. 
2. Self posts for images. Well, there is already a work-around and loophole in current rules where users can post a collage of more than one twitter screenshot and not use exact title rule. Self post provides an easier editorializing of the title. Exactly how will this help reducing shitpost is unclear to me. 
3. New common account that is purely for communication. Does this mean you are now willing to discuss controversial mod decisions in public? This will help the community to understand the thought that went behind deleting some comment or thread and what was the subjective reasoning used? Unless subjective decisions are discussed and debated, these rules are just anchors of imposing your opinion on mod activities. Any comment can be constructed to violate any random rule because ""I felt so"" without any accountability to the community! Modmail is just a safety net because you are afraid that you may have been wrong and 15 people collectively pouncing on one person is better that 300+ people pouncing on the mods for a wrong decision.  Media,Random,Other.


I guess these will be cool flairs. [deleted] Good points...personally, am in complete agreement  *AskIndia*   *Governance*  what do this flairs even mean? 

And how am I suppose to make a self post on a meme in NP category? Defeats the purpose of Memes doesn't it? Thought this place would be more open and free. Definitely need a Political sub and also rules 'only where needed'.  [deleted] >Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Who is going to decide this ?
As it is, there is already too much censorship in a so called platform for free speech. Request:Can politics/religion related posts (I put those two because they are closely linked) be moved to /r/IndiaPolitics or /r/IndianPolitics or whatever that sub is? Would be nice to have more music related posts. Especially folk music from different parts of the country. Please ban twitter and facebook from unverified accounts altogether. Even the ""screenshot+blur"" thing is ridiculous. Self posts with an actual argument that quotes statements from known but unverified officials (i.e. legit public figures who don't have the mark of verification) should be allowed. >Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

And yet you have trolls calling the PM a faggot. How about a [Health] or [Medicine] flair as well? Indians can do with some evidence based medicine. > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.   

I agree with twitter restriction and most of twitter posts are again self-posts without any explanation behind them^Swamy. But, memes keeps the sub interesting. Some of the memes are shit, but I have seen some amusing ones that are randian's creativity.   


> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

And on a serious note, I think we need [Humor] or [Satire] or something on sort of similar lines. How about Reli[G]ious Start a [Gender issues] flair

AskIndia,"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",36,3huilc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,98,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki.

1. A self-post? Do you mean a comment?
2. Do you mean ""non-personal verified"" instead of ""non-personal and verified""?

> Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.

Isn't submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?

And so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are ""non-personal verified"" accounts like @PMOIndia, right? >Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.

In such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? Have seen a few such posts in the recent past. All of this is going to lead to  more controversies.  Ok, I almost never checkin here except when I do the odd RDD thread but I cannot believe this kind of policing is still happening!

What kind of a place has this turned into that it's making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? Here we go again. More and more poorly thought out rules, imposed on the subreddit without any discussion. 

Indians are political and argumentative people. You mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules. Just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions. 

This is a chai stall at a railway station, not a formal dinner in Victorian England.  Why is so much importance being given to political/religious threads? 

Why isn't the 'no low-effort' rule being applied to all the threads and posts? 

Man, either apply the rules uniformly or don't apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort. I have seen the 'no low-effort' rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything. More subjective rules with loopholes as a pre-requisite and a necessary design criteria. 

Now, there is no way to differentiate between these two. 

1. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
2. Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.

So, basically, when our **subjective call** says that the user is ""*Flaming the forum*"", we can insta-ban the user. But, we can use yet another **subjective call** to claim that a different user was just indulging in Political humor. 

Just let this forum be. Why the fuck do we have religious threads This is how you make a Dead Sub. I've seen /r/india's rules worst so far. The twitter rules are fucking irritating.  >This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.

WTF. Why can't you guys just let the sub be as it is without adding new rules etc for even one month?

>Would be renamed to Policy. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government

I don't understand the need for a separate flair for this. Such discussions should be under Politics. [removed] Less objectivity, more subjectivity... I can already see numerous ways in which these rules can be twisted and interpreted to suit a person's personal biases.

>Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.

What criteria will be used to decide whether a comment is low-effort or not? Mods' subjective views?

>asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed.

Okay, so if supporters of a particular party bash another party based on a false report(as has happened so many times), and later on the truth gets posted, can we not ask where the bashers are now? Whats wrong with that? Nice. Also please try and do a full revision of the rules. Like all the rules at one place. Hallelujah!! Thanks for this! Are these rules going live along with post, or are you looking for building up opinion and then implememting it? 
 Agreed with the policy for political threads, but not religious threads. As rational people we should be allowed to ridicule religions. Not adherents, but the religion itself. 

If I wish to call Mohammad a paedophile, Yahweh a genocidal maniac or Indra a pussy-man, there shouldn't be a ban on it.  Could you sticky this, please? >accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions


WTF? Also, /r/IndianPeopleFacebook should be listed under related subs. 

/r/IndianFootball too. Oh, NSFW Indian subs too. Why the discrimination? What about genuine criticism of some aspect of a religion? For instance, me calling radhe maa human diarrhoea posing as a Hindu, rather than, say, calling Hinduism diarrhoea in religion form. So where exactly are you drawing the line?",2015-08-21 21:37:11
AskIndia,[R]Feedback thread the sequel. Results and announcements.,29,2o2rpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2o2rpl/rfeedback_thread_the_sequel_results_and/,256,"Dear Subscribers,

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old “United We Stand Banner” - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones. 

Thanks!
",i_am_not_sam," what about flair for **science** lets discuss science articles also , it will be very useful for learning new things  [deleted] >but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation

This is quite a violation, no?

I'm sure you will say that if you want to critique, bring it up within /r/india and not outside? But /r/subredditdrama can, while indulging in schadenfreude, still keep us on our toes instead of giving one the feeling that critique is being swept under the carpet. [deleted] I have hidden the score for 60 minutes for now, but I believe given the traffic in /r/India the comment scores should be hidden for 120 minutes. Thoughts? Can the OP be Highlighted more clearly? Its just a more saturated blue, which isn't easy to figure out. For example, most subs have a Blue Background box behind OP name when submitting comments. Can we at least get some Indian mods? Someone who respects Indian sensibilities? Someone who understands, recognises and agrees with the democratic opinion of the country? 

Actually, I know the answer. Take it up your own modmail. 
 > * Clarification on Flairs

This clarification has been a long time coming. You should have given this clarification *before* banning people from the sub for it. Anyways, better late than never.

> * Score hiding
> * New moderator
> * Repost removal

All good steps. I congratulate the mod team. Why has this thread been posted so late in the night?

Wouldn't the more logical thing be to post it during India hours when most active subscribers are awake? > Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will be holding elections in a few weeks.

So someone like hindusanghi123 will be the next mod now? > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.
 
Nope. It's become a lot more intolerant community which believes in violently criticizing groups of people or people in public but cannot take a personal insult when called to question on it. If you delight in shaming people you don't know from the comforts of your keyboard, it'd be hypocritic not to be ready to take insults in return.

> Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bullshit. So is the unverified twitter account rule.

> Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof , but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation.

Can (and is) abused. Use Meta flair for this.

> Score hiding

The crappiest parochial thought fart someone ever had.

> About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed

What's the problem with them? Bad titling?

> Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit

Absolutely no point to this. Leave it to the user's intelligence.

Adding a question, why is **pure theology** as /u/rahulthewall puts it is **banned** in this subreddit? Isn't this also a sub where history is discussed. A verse of the Rig Veda was banned while an article talking about Hindu mythology in medium.com was allowed. Clarify your stand. If you're supporting banning it in the future, that's stupid.

The twitter flair is a nice idea BTW. score hiding will be awesome. good job mods!

ps. would never want to become mod. too much hardwork. you guys are good keep it up Can you put multiple flairs on the same post? i.e. if I post an article which is more than 6 months old about a political subject - what should I flair it as?   

What if it's a Twitter comment which is political and more than 6 months old?   
 >Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bad

>but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama

Bad

>For instance /r/polandball[6] does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Bad.

Everything else sounds great.
 [deleted] Points are still visible on mobile or if you disable CSS, right?  Are you guys still taking the feedback? If yes then I suggest to NOT include AskIndia flair but instead redirect those to /r/AskIndia. Like /r/europe has on the top.

Also sometimes exact title rule doesn't really tell what is in the article. So for that something like *editorialized* flair should be there.

And now some queries - how much time should we wait for the mods to respond if the modmail is sent? Does *Repost removal policy* apply only to that article from one source or other sources too? Because different sources have difference in how the story is presented >About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.

You don't have to ban all links from these sites. Just the ones that have embedded YouTube/Vimeo videos. 

Also, could you guys have AutoMod notify us every time a comment that breaks the rule is deleted. I use c*unt a lot, and it seems to be a word that is monitored closely. Often I've noticed that my comments carrying the word get deleted even when used in a non-sexist or satirical context. I would like to know if/when any of my comments are deleted. I don't see what's wrong with it.  Thanks for the flairs!

Edit: I still see two flairs only. Not activated yet?

Edit 2: Ah I see.  > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.

> **Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal 
attack? Yes.** 

What the fuck? May I know when are you going to ban words like ""kulcha"" and ""kulcha warriors"" ???  Thanks for the change.  > New link flairs to be introduced -

No kulcha flair? Nice Work , When it will be done ? > We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc

What about those cases in which no reply is received even after several reminders?

> please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. 

Again, you only pick and reply. The community should know if the mods are showing partisanship. 

> Is bringing up a user's posting history can be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

So basically I'm allowed to say one thing today and say something completely opposite tomorrow? > We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india[1] debate

What will be the criteria to select this shortlist? Thanks for the link flairs! That was required. 

Score hiding for an hour is good too. Please extend that to comment scores as well. 

 >New link flairs to be introduced -

Could we have a ""Uplifting News"" flair? I have been requesting for this for a while! Plis to include me on mod nomination plij.

I think this sub can use a right of center mod. :P

 >  Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

Can a person abuse himself/herself in the flair? My flair e.g. All I have to say is, please make sure the next mod is not a liberal. ALL of the mods are liberal as of now. Approved  Can we have some information about RTI in the /r/india wiki?


Also why 

> cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india




 Still zero feedback for why the mods seem terrified or simply unwilling to take any action against certain posters of a 'secular'/Leftist political bias with a habit of targeting others and the r/india community as a whole.

Are these posters mods or admins? Is that why they are completely immune and get a blank check to do whatever they like? Please clarify.  BTW mods, I'd appreciate if you applied the 'won't show downvotes' rule for new threads as well, because me and other posters identified as 'bhakts' or 'Sanghis' have been facing very furious and concerted downvote herding from r/india's 'secular' posters and lurkers. 

Every new thread I've posted in the last couple of weeks has been quickly downvoted to keep its score near 0 and usually certain posters keep topping that up every few minutes to ensure it never gets more than a few total votes and stays far off the front page.

AskIndia,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",11,4qepvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,14,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

",rajasthaniConfused," >Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can't answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn't be marrying the guy anyway.

Just my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.

Here is why?

If you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.

Drop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.


 Honor Killing is a possibility... They'll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. 

But seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. 

Screw your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she's gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. 

Chill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don't matter. 

Time heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

Yes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that's that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don't worry.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Asshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don't you marry there. Nobody will really care in a few years.",2016-06-29 17:51:13
AskIndia,[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,51,3ecyjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ecyjp/mod_post_introducing_new_flairs_for_better/,33,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon.

**Edit:** We renamed the Regular flair to Scheduled to better reflect the purpose of the flair.",r_india_mod," [deleted] Yo. Team, I think we need to explain governance better, or force it to have a submission statement to raise the bar for the discussion. You have introduced new flairs. But how do you sort based on them? I see only 6 categories on the right... More Flair Categories: TIL, History/Philosophy/Literature, LongReads, Entertainment/Arts

Color Scheme for flairs: Similar to r/science or r/technology

Theme: Even r/Bharat a mature sub, has vibrant colors, our theme is dull, should have colors which looks interactive. > Governance - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet.

It's such a relief from the regular political bashing. A job well done dear mods! Can we have a flair for Defence ? To club news related to defence, intelligence and strategy ? Can we get an '**Entertainment**' flair for posting Bollywood related stuff? I suggest including a ""health"" flair.  we need a new flair to tag all the Twitter posts.

Yeah and not just the subreddit.  For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

If we could just tone down our condescending attitudes,maybe more people will start contributing on /r/india. Now what is seen is comments of same set of people on almost every post. that's exactly the problem with India,we have schemes and schemes of things,but no follow up to the end. /r/kannada Rarely Active?

AskIndia,Bill Gates' thoughts on Climate change and India's Role in it.,86,3wcid0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3wcid0/bill_gates_thoughts_on_climate_change_and_indias/,10,"He thinks that asking India to switch to cleaner and costlier energy is unfair. The developed world should take the initiative, dramatically increase investment in Energy R&D and come up with cheaper alternatives that are sustainable for developing economies like ours. 
Here's the excerpt from his interview with The Atlantic. 
>..when you turn to India and say, “Please cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that’s really expensive, subsidized energy,” that’s really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer.

>I’m a big believer in foreign aid, but the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they’ll make it cheap enough for everyone else. But the big numbers are all in the developed economies, where China’s defined into that term.

> I want to call up India someday and say, “Here’s a source of energy that is cheaper than your coal plants, and by the way, from a global-pollution and local-pollution point of view, it’s also better.”


[Full interview here](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/11/we-need-an-energy-miracle/407881/) It's worth a read. ",running_flash," You liked what he said? Twit to him and let him know about that. Bill Gates is an admirable brilliant character, unlike his late counterpart in another company. You know who... What if there is no renewable technology that is cheaper than coal? Should we say ""oh well, the free market didn't solve it, therefore let's all die in 60 years"". Carbon has a cost; we will end up paying it one way or another.

And obviously the west should do more. The biggest hurdle to combating Climate change from the West is the republicans that still in denial mode. And the powerful oil+gas lobbies. I wouldn't be surprised if their money funds cutting nuclear research, and many anti-nuclear activists.

It's kinda sad that he considers China a developed country that should be taking the lead on climate change and India a poor developing country, but that's reality I guess.

It's also important to remember that The Atlantic caters to a US liberal audience who are hugely upset by the climate denying crazies in the American right - India's problems are a distant concern. But to us in India the pollution levels are WORSE than China, so we should do more than be complacent. Throwing our arms in the air and going ""the west needs to fix it, not our problem"", is ultimately self-defeating.

But yes of course, the West needs to share renewable research and help out developing nations too.",2015-12-11 15:40:15

Need some help / advice from you guys.

I am a salaried software engineer in Bangalore, but I'm also getting offers for freelance stuff. I am mulling over a few of these.

One of them seems promising. Three dudes in US are asking me to help bootstrap their startup, and I think I'd take this one.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

Thanks for the help.

[Note: I am not sure how to add ""AskIndia"" tag. Mods please help]",microsoftholmes," if the amount is not very significant related to your salary , say about 25% of your salary, you can file an ITR showing it as income from other sources, but ideally, you should file ITR 4. ",2017-06-27 04:13:13

This video does an amazing job of explaining the problem with fpps. 

There are several alternatives to it, some are linked in that video itself.

Fpps is considered to be one of the worst system of elections and you can trace many of our problems to it. 

Edit: some of the alternatives are alternate vote and single transferable vote.  Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. 
For eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low. 

This was the system followed in Britain at the time of Indian independence. That and the simplicity of the system led the makers of the Constitution to adopt it.

PS:X-Post from r/AskIndia",VIKing10," They do accept , provided you have an excellent academic record along with other things to show , like research papers , RA etc. The acceptance rates are very low though.

If you consider swiss uni. like ETHZ , they also ask for course material you referred so that you meet the academic standards/background they expect. I assume it's something similar in Germany. US universities generally accept any 4 year course if you want to apply for MS/MS+Phd. They look at your academic record and GRE scores.

Getting into top-end universities is extremely hard though and there is a lot of competition from all over the world. If you want full scholarship (this is usually given to MS+PhD students) the competition is just insane for places like MIT/Stanford.

I'm not 100% sure about Germany but the UK accepts Indian 3 year undergraduate programs (except medicine, you need to sit for PLAB). I'd imagine germany is similar to UK. I just saw this on my FB feed about PhD in Germany. Check if you find anything useful. DAAD, a student exchange programme between India and Germany, hosts many webinars and expos.

This means that any reasonably efficient attempt at trying to make sense of Indian history must, unfortunately, gloss over the hundreds of thousands of little stories that went into making modern India. Take, for instance, the liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

> *""On the night of July 22, 1954, a group of nearly fifteen volunteers of the United Front of Goans (UFG) under the leadership of freedom fighters Francis Mascarenhas and Vaman Desai assembled outside the border to discuss the details of the assault. They marched across the border and approached Dadra, around midnight. When they neared the police station, they recognised sub-inspector Aniceto Rosario, their archenemy. He was responsible for the ill treatment of UFG members in the police custody at Daman and they sought revenge. At that time, he was addressing a group of 100 to 150 villagers; warning them against the illegal entry by outsiders through their fields. They were also told that disobeying the orders would be met with serious consequences. The volunteers managed to crawl into the village, while some of them mixed with the locals assembled at the meeting. The remaining went round and began to close in from behind the police station.""*

Much violence followed. More [here](http://www.navhindtimes.in/ilive/how-18th-june-road-got-its-name). And in this newspaper clipping [here](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19540724&id=wXUjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sL4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5673,3493515).

Two weeks later Nagar Haveli was also captured, and the liberators declared that the little enclave was now ""Free Dadra And Nagar Haveli"", an independent country, with no international recognition of course, but run by a pro-Indian government called the Varishtha Panchayat. Some time afterwards the Panchayat asked India for help to run the enclave. 
> *""In response to requests from the Varishta Panchayat and the Administrator of Nagar-Aveli, Dr. A. Furtado, who proposed to resign, the Government of India agreed to make available the services of a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service as the Administrator of those areas. Shri K. G. Badlani took over as the new Administrator with effect from 17 October 1960. It is also proposed to elect a new Panchayat to replace the present Panchayat which consists of nominees. This new Panchayat would act as the Legislative Council of the liberated areas.""*

From this Ministry of External Affairs report [here](http://mealib.nic.in/?pdf2487?000). (PDF)

Meanwhile the Portuguese government took India to the International Court of Justice. The court passed a judgement that upheld the Portuguese claim that its sovereign territory had been over-run, but then curiously passed another judgement that prevented the Portuguese from actually doing anything about the Indian 'invasion'.  Copy of the judgement [here](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/32/4521.pdf). (PDF)

Understandably, both countries insisted that the ruling went in their respective favour.

Thus for seven years, from 1954 to 1961, Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed in a state of political limbo, nicely helped along by the government of India and Mr. Badlani.

And then in 1961, after Portuguese India had fallen and been annexed by Indian forces, D&NH requested to be merged with India. The popular telling of what happened next is as follows: D&NH quickly created a legislature, that then elected IAS officer KG Badlani as Prime Minister of Dadra and Nagar Haveli for just one day. That same day he signed over the territory to the Republic of India. And this handover was formalized with the tenth amendment to the Indian Constitution. Amendment details [here](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/NowHereThis/now-here-this-6/1076673-164.100.47.134/intranet/cai/a.pdf?c=66b2a0b7-a1c6-4faa-8c15-2659fdd94b72). (PDF)

I've not been able to source any documents to suggest that Badlani was actually made a ""Prime Minister For A Day"". But there is little doubt that he was, if only briefly, the head of state of a tiny little quasi-independent enclave in India before it was gobbled up by the republic.

And thus, my email-friends, was a nation built.

",iKidA," Wiki article tells that apparently the Marathas 'sold' off Dadra as a concession to Portugese to enlist their support against British. 

Also, RSS played a keyrole in the mini revolution to liberate D&NG from Portugese Thanks for putting this up. We must have more posts like this about the history of our country.",2014-05-14 17:25:58
AskIndia,[askindia] Someone please help me with my anxiety and porn addiction.,59,fpuopo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpuopo/askindia_someone_please_help_me_with_my_anxiety/,39,"I've been addicted to porn and masturbation for over 5 years. I've tried to stop several times but I just couldn't. I don't feel guilty or ashamed about it. It's  just that I want to be in control of myself. I think I'm compulsively consuming it as it eases my anxiety. If I stop watching I feel like tearing my head apart. My heart starts racing and I feel extremely irritable. 

I've already visited three pyschiatrists and talked about this. Tried anxiety meds that made me feel even more miserable. I don't know how else to come out this. I feel like I need to replace it with something else that will ease my anxiety. idk please help.",firealpaca11," Your porn addiction is a Coping mechanism for your root problem.

 Stopping that addiction won't be enough also you will in a relapse and then building your streak, so don't be hard on yourself. Educate yourself on these topics. Are you interested in learning music? Maybe pick up some instrument? It will help. There's only one way to beat any addiction, you need to spend that energy somewhere else. Check r/nofap As with all addictions you need to taper it off.

Also you need to fill the void with something else. Do a lot more of this productive activity that you enjoy as you taper off your addiction.

Like you said you don't feel guilty or regret about porn and fapping.

That is the perfect attitude to drop an addiction. Keep trying to taper off your habits and don't feel guilty or regret if you get off your tapering schedule. 

Like with anything in life, all it takes is practice. How many times do you jerk off in a day? Educating yourself on this will divert your attention away from it. Keep reading articles on how bad it is. And you will start to leave it gradually. Kuch aur timepass dhundh karne ko. Play games like Europa Universalis IV or Stellaris. Start lifting weights.Replace one with another obsession.  I am damn sure that lifting weights religiously will improve your life a lot. sadly, you can do it now. So, I guess meditate. And keep yourself busy. You should keep your self busy in others tasks you like to do, it could be some hobby of yours or anything which you enjoy doing. When i was addicted, i figured out that whenever i was free i always surfed the internet for porn which led to me doing the same as you. Keep your mind busy. This will give your heart some solace.

Read that book and thank me later.

P S: masturbation and porn are ok but why do that when there are real relationships out there .. What's scaring you? Are you procrastinating ?
Is there something that you are supposed to be doing and not doing ? 
.
Do it. And remember how good it feels when you're anxiety free. Doesn't it feel good? Don't you want that?
.
Or do you want few seconds of dopamine rush that just doesn't feel enough and stay mind fucked the entire time? What's better OP? Few seconds of boost or a continuous good feeling, motivation, excitement? 
.
Others have covered the topics already. 
https://youtu.be/QUpyimrptw0 
Try this, might motivate you a bit. Remember the porn isn't real. It's fucking you up, this is not what we are supposed to be doing or atleast not to this extent. Start doing workout, yoga Don't do boring stuff Don't worry too much about the porn and masturbation. There have been many studies that indicate that they won't hurt you. Although you still need to understand that most of the stuff shown in porn is unrealistic and you shouldn't base any real life expectations on that.

As for your anxiety, that appears to be a medical condition and you should seek help from qualified personnels for that. Try meditating, exercising, sticking to a schedule and keeping yourself busy if nothing else helps. Read tantra and spiritual texts. Then you can transcend the sexual energy to another higher level. The point here is not to become spiritual but to see the broad picture like from a higher dimension. Find a girl. put your friend in isolation I am not a psychologist nor is anyone in these comments. Visit one and take a opinion from there. This is not the place you must discuss this. Which one affects you more? porn or masturbation?  Can you do one without the other?

* Lost a quarter of my net worth due to market crash.
* Will be fucked in my appraisal coming in 2 weeks due to the market condition.
* Will probably be fired in coming months if the recession gets bad.

So yeah, not going through great times. We will be seeing the impact in next couple of weeks, depends on how the situation turns out. We're being to work from home. No people have been let go so far and I don't think they will be (atleast for full time employees) as well as the top management said they have reserve funds to go through this. In my city, many textile shops and malls are cutting down staff. I know a few owners, they collectively employ more than 3000 workers. Half of them have been asked to go on leave for 15 days without pay. They are free to quit if they wish.

Hotels are already closed down and fired 75 percent of workers. The small businesses won't be able to pay the rent so they have no option but to shut shop.

The impact is going to be big in a few months. The people who will lose their jobs or get reduced pay probably aren't on reddit in the first place. Some of my friends for leave without pay as there is not enough work. My company is suggesting that it's employees come  to work and is even offering to pay 200Rs/hr. I work for a BPO in Malad. I do content writing for a few clients, and they suddenly decided to go lean last week. Work was alloted, deadlines set, and then I was told to stop writing with immediate effect. 
>was already going through a recession...

Recession will hit now. So the firm where I work part-time gave me unpaid leave till 31st due to the lockdown and due to there being not a lot of work as they primarily work with events. 

I still have some cash coming in from my Freelance clients so I'm good for now and going forward too unless all my clients dump me. Looking forward to relaxing in quarantine till the 31st at least. Will start panicking after that. Recieved Paycut , job is in danger Tech company. Pay hikes cancelled Dev at a small company.

AskIndia,[askindia] Are there any hikikomori in India? Are you one? Let's talk about this.,8,fvatsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvatsr/askindia_are_there_any_hikikomori_in_india_are/,9,"Hello, 

The home isolation has caught up to me and I'm wondering what it's like for people in India who have been reclusive and have been living at home for years and years. Is the phenomena of hikikomori different in India? I know many in our country are unemployed. Where do such people live? Are they truly socially reclusive? How do people make ends meet in such a dire situation? How do they cope with the extreme social isolation and general disregard of a non contributor in a society? What can people do to identify such behaviors? What triggered it for you? Is there a way to curb such triggers? 

If you do relate to this phenomenon please don't shy away and open up about what you feel. Indians suffer a lot of developmental problems when growing up. Some people are high functioning despite their inherent problem which often snowballs into something big, it's only a matter of time. Bullying and peer pressure play a huge role in our society and affects our personal decisions. How do we mitigate all of this?

I'd love to engage with you guys over here for now and have a better understanding of your expectations and needs. To whoever that participates on this thread: please be civil and respectful. God knows how much people have already suffered.",tralfamadelorean31," The whole concept of hikikomori might be differently perceived in India than what is generally seen in Japan. India definitely have a fair share of recluse populace, but I doubt the people who stay in isolation for such long time can survive in India. Most of the parents of hikikomoris in Japan have come to accept the fact that their son/daughter is a shut in. I can't even imagine our parents being like that, especially when we as a country fail to stress the importance of mental health. Been working for a few months now but I spent around 5 years unemployed prior to it.

Lived with parents. Still do. They've been supportive.

College was the trigger for me I had zero liking for the course and at the same time didn't really have any interest at all which I could pursue instead. So I dragged myself through graduation because something was better than no qualification at all.

Initially I went through that phase where I punished myself for being a useless loser who fell behind his peers. But I never had any dreams or passions with regards to career and stuff so my NEET status in itself gradually stopped being too bothersome an issue to handle but every once in a while, when things went South, I wished I had a bearable facade of a purpose to keep myself occupied during those times. 

I've been always been pretty bad at socialising. Once I went into the NEET lifestyle and got completely acclimatised to it, it worsened the matter. I stopped keeping in touch with the few friends I had from school. I felt as if we inhabited different worlds so there wasn't much to converse about. Made a few friends online but the came and went.

I work now but it hasn't affected my feelings about work and social life. Working 9 hours a day, 6 days a week continues to he an outrageously ridiculous concept to me and I almost never desire to create new connections. I can't guess what exactly would have made the difference for me because I remember myself being like this even in my oldest memories.",2020-04-05 16:57:48

AskIndia,[AskIndia]How did China prevent the virus spreading to other states but allowed it to spread across India ?,0,fsxw4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsxw4g/askindiahow_did_china_prevent_the_virus_spreading/,12,"Nation's life and death is hinging on these questions:

1. How could China prevent virus transmitting to another state but allowed it to spread across India?
2. How is China treating Corona patients(which vaccines, which medicines)? The mortality in China is just 3% but Italy got much higher mortality rates
3. Is China hiding their numbers and millions of people actually died there?

Jai Shri Ram.",satyasys," 1. They cant and didnt  
You can't 'control' life. It finds a way...      
2. Treating symptoms, drug combo's and experience from previous outbreaks. They were already in a better prepared scenario and was able to scale up infrastructure in a couple of weeks/along with early internal lockdown.  
Italy didn't take adequate precautions, has a higher older age population and was late to respond. The worst is over for italy now. US and possibly Brazil could top charts next if not us.       
3. Possible many countries are doing atm. Mortality rates in countries which took adequate precautions and had better responsive/emergency measures have low mortality rates along with greater testing. China hid the numbers, and the peak started to develop during a human mass migration event. This allowed the virus to start spreading everywhere. The Chinese government, if it did not hide the spread of the virus, would have stopped travel way before CNY migration started. The spread in India came through International travel. * Dictatorship does as dictatorship wishes. The Chinese media whose only source is the government said that it didn't, doesn't mean it didn't. 

* Italy has a very high population of senior citizens and unluckily they had to be left untreated to save the younger population.

* If not millions, at least a lakh did. 

JSR 1. Cuz the virus didn't ask for China's permission before spreading across India. It controlled it internally the same way India is trying to - by enforcing lockdowns. 

2. This is a slightly technical question. Better to ask it on r/covid19 if you want good answers.

3. Yes, it is possible. No one outside the Chinese govt will ever know the truth. 1. It spread through whole of China before it spread to India or anywhere else
2. Mortality is in reality about 10% or more in China (Italy's health care system is way better than China's)
3. Millions died in China

The commies are just good at lying. It just seems like Chernobyl al over again. In a couple of months we will get the real numbers out of China. Its stupid to postulate China allowed to spread it to India. India is a sovereign nation and had done well to not have cases imported from Wuhan. The second wave is from Gulf US and UK.

As for 2 - why don't you look at internet. Age based mortality and treatments etc. China is opaque - authoritarian communist regime. Anything coming out of there cannot be trusted. But you already know that don't you ? China model vs Indian democracy",2020-04-01 19:18:38

Like putting Modiji's photo in your purse and removing your parents. 

Some quirky things like that. Since youve tried the path of rationality and failed  try either 1 of these 2.

1) go super bakth as someone already suggested. Start doing Modi japas 24×7. Go as crazy as you can.

2) establish a patriotic stand first. Change your dp to Bose or Bagath Singh etc. Vande Maataram is your caller tune and blast it every day in the house BUT start framing bakths  and Modi as anti nationals. Call them.liars and terrorist every chance you have. If ppl come to argue have solid facts to back your argument. Shouldnt be hard because they really are liars and terrorists. Again go crazy.

Don't feel guilty whatever you do, it's in service of the nation. You can't convince them honestly. 1. Excuses: Ask them to give you proof of what he has done. Tell them data shows the GDP growth and employment are at their lowest. India’s ranking has fell on most accounts. So what has he done really? 

2. Anger: Explain to them that just because Modi is there terrorists haven’t stopped entering. If they entered before they still do and if they didn’t then, then don’t now too. The Indian Army for most part works independent of the party in power. It’s a rhetoric being fed to people. 

3. Bhakt mentality: This one is tough to counter but ask them counter questions like “do you want a Hindu Pakistan?” They seem to be allergic to the word Pakistan so coupling these two freaks them out. Also you can mention how Gandhi espoused for a secular India and wanted equality for all irrespective of religion. If they say anything bad about Muslim community as a whole, start bashing them by saying that they are pathetic creature and people with same mentality are there in both religion and won't let peace prevail in this country . Ask them whether he will be happy if u go an kill someone/be a part of riot since he want hindu rastra . And don't pay them any respect , since they don't deserve it . Ignore them and irritate them with all news forwards , the so called good dead of modi. Make them see the videos of the riots and tell him whether he want u to be the one of the victims or even the oppresors. Don't participate in any religious thing and if necessary u can even point out their fake hinduism that they practice by quoting swami Vivekananda.  If they love u , they can't ignore these things and if they still don't care better avoid them and make them feel that u hate them and don't care about them Just dont give up on them. Keep calm and fight back with facts. A lot of times people fool themselves with fake news. They know its probably fake but since their echo chamber says its true they run with it. when they are repeatedly confronted with the realization that what they read on whatsapp is probably no true theyll begin to see the light.   


  
if they dont . make a mental note that in case you have kids youll never force hate on them. No point arguing don't spoil your relations. Everything ends do not worry, they have placed him on a pedestal. With time how things are panning out looking at current condition he too will fall like several others that came before him. It's sad that this douche had to happen when we were still doing good even with huge curruption. Give it time this too shall pass. Ask them why Modi is advertising Gandhi to Trump, who is a villain and not Godse ji who was the greatest desh bhakt who ever lived. Also ask them why Modiji let Trump visit the monument built by traitor Mughals and not the Sardar statue which is the greatest virat monument ever built.. Is Modi gone sickular and become an apologist of Gandhi Nehru legacy.. If they are old people, try explaining them what Hinduism actually is. It's definitely not killing people. XD Show them the video of the real purohit of Ayodhya saying that Babri demolition was wrong. Show them videos about Swami Vivekananda and Gandhiji responding to communal flares.

http://www.helplinelaw.com/real-estate-wills-probate-and-trust/GIPIL/inheritance-property-law-in-india.html You need a lawyer to go through all the minute details of your case and tell you the legitimate possibility of suing them. Another advice for you is always prefer a settlement over going to court. My grandpa's brother sold joint land without his permission 20 years ago. My grandpa is still fighting the case. I think it depends on what kind of inheritance it is. If the property was inherited by your grandfather through a will, then he can do whatever he wants with it. If it was inherited without a will, then he will have to get NOC from all his children before selling it. Yes. Daughters have equal rights. They could not have sold it without your mother's consent. I am surprised how the Land Registration even happened.",2020-03-03 14:31:02
AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.",10,fkql7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fkql7h/askindia_fathersmothers_of_reddit_india_what_were/,5,"Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories.",2throwawaythrowaway," OP, post this in r/TWOXINDIA as well. https://www.babycenter.com/childbirth-class has all you need to know about child birth. Regarding centers,city,hospital, I don’t know. India C section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors. Most cases natural birth is possible without much medication. 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication. 4th one (actually our 2nd) she took epidural. 1. Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.
2. 3 is average and is by no means overweight.   
3. Cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated. I was checked every hour when I went in while in labor (about 3-4 times). Ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress.
4. Any bleeding in late term, even if it's due to cervical examination needs to be monitored. Unless the doctor did a membrane sweep, there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity I guess.
5. I had a cervical check a day prior to my labor (I was at week 39 and very close to my due date) and I had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night. I woke up with back pain after midnight and I just knew this was it. Went to the loo, water broke, told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents. Waddled to hospital 2 hours later after I timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart. 
6. High risk and multiples. Also Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women (I was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof).
7. Only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india don't have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push. 
8. None. I was birthing at my home town. So I chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as ""google"" led. Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala but I'm of the ""give birth in hospital"" opinion as I don't know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies. 
All the best. Best to cross post to the twoxindia sub as well.",2020-03-18 22:43:12

India has been bullying all forms of protesters. When Malaysia criticized an Indian policy, Indian government stopped importing palm oil from Malaysia. But Karma always bites back with interest. 

Many USA company heads are also criticizing India, resulting in backlash from government of India. It may be a just matter of time, USA gets royally pissed off with India and starts imposing sanction in the lines of Iran, Iraq, Syria.

Your thoughts please.",satyasys," If we get sanctioned then the poor will suffer more, so I hope never Not happening. Some legislators and committees here and there may criticize, but outright sanctions are out of the question. US and EU governments are neither that moral nor that concerned as to jeopardize all their business investments and military purchases from India. I doubt that will happen because US sees India as a counter to China How delusional can you be? The world isn't a black and white place where justice is always served and righteous people always win. Everyone has their vested interests.

And you seriously think that there are only 10 crore bhakts?

Sometimes it makes me think that the left wing is filled with idealistic babies with zero knowledge of ground realities. I sometimes wonder, is the IQ level of reddit crowd plummeting day by day or what? 

What are you, a 14 year old asking such retarded questions when you yourself can very vividly answer the question yourself. 

* India is a major trading partner to many important countries including the USA, EU and Russia. 
* India has far more good relations with other governments of Latin America, Africa than it has enemies. 
* On what moral grounds will the countries sanction us? CAA? On what grounds? When the most powerful country in the world actively blocks citizens from random muslim countries and EU nations have their own problems with immigration, integration. 
* Comparing with the countries like Iran, Iraq, Syria. You would be dead if you had pulled even the 1% of protest level against the government. I mean do you even know what you write? Imao china has literal concentration camps for Muslims and the world did shit.  People need to stop seeing west as some bastion of justice they only sanction someone when they have something to gain. Sanctions are a foreign concept. we don't care. 

Bhakts will be happy that now hindus can manufacture whatever they want right here in india.

They will see this as a plus. This has been discussed on this sub before.

The govt's response to protests against the CAA is an internal matter, and much like the US President's subtle, indirect support of neo-Nazis and white supremacy in America, the outside world doesn't have the authority to interfere. What happens is that with the outcomes of studies like the Democracy Index, Freedom of Press, Ease of Doing Business etc, the conception of India changes. And that impression is quite important when it comes to European countries investing in India, or even Japanese/Korean companies investing in India. 

There is no doubt about the fact that the right wing ideology pursued by the govt is hurting or economy, but it won't invite sanctions a la North Korea or Iran. The only thing that could do so now is if India invaded PoK, or something similarly drastic, which the BJP govt won't do before the Delhi elections. BJP could be the worst govt in recent memory, but criticizing our sanctions on Malaysia is plain stupid. Our foreign service did the right thing.

In foreign affairs a head of a country usually does not comment on the internal affairs of another country be it right or wrong. Even the presidents of fucking America and China do not explicitly comment on our internal affairs the way Mahatir did.

The language used is very important, usually presidents use statements like ' we hope for a de-escalation etc. ' and they do not mention the ruling govt of another country in their statement.

If Mahatir had genuine concerns he would have no issues criticizing China for their uighur treatment.

If we didnt sanction Malaysia for that statement we would be treated as pushovers on the world stage. There is no right or wrong in foreign affairs, India being a big regional power has to act like one. > USA gets royally pissed off with India and starts imposing sanction in the lines of Iran, Iraq, Syria.

US can no longer apply sanctions to India the way they did back in 1998. The US depends a lot on India for cheap labor and an upcoming Internet-related customer base.

Even if Modi turns into a dictator, they will appease him with free shit and get a hand into the market.

Also, Modi is Trump's bitch. India is resistant to sanctions to a certain extent. It would also be beneficial for us in the long run. Earlier sanctions against India during the nuclear program helped in building local industries and increasing local technology. Economic sanctions will come but may not be for the reasons you have mentioned. Right wing and nationalism is rising across the world. And this would result in more and more closing of borders in the name of protecting national interests. This is what is going to affect global trade in the near future. Just my two cents. Won't happen unless China becomes less of a threat. Right now the US needs us Kiska sanctions ? UNSC or by US or by EU ?
Sanctions are placed only when a country possesses an ""immediate"" threat or is indulging in HR violations.
And what will be restricted? Travel ban, arms embargo, economic and trade.
Sanctions work when other nations co-operate, EU sanctions crippled Russia and UN sanctions obliterated Iran's economy Many small time journalists/reporters to get ideas, roam around on social media, so are you one? To all the nay sayers.. Don't be too Confident about our geopolitical importance.. Sanctions don't have to be big blanket bans.. Today environmental clearances are no longer required for oil exploration, the way reliance works they're gonna rape whatever site they will work on..

AskIndia,What steps women can take for their safety. [AskIndia],424,e3ond3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e3ond3/what_steps_women_can_take_for_their_safety/,196,"Time and again, we have so many incidents of crime against women India. We can't have policemen or guardians accompanying women all the time.  What all steps women can take in case of emergency. Few things that comes to my mind 


1. Carry pepper spray. Also, please do an emergency drill for using it. 

2. Learn self-defense martial arts. 

3. Carry taser?

4. Always notify someone while traveling alone in cab/auto. Share registration number of vehicle loudly on call.  So that driver knows someone is aware of your whereabouts. 

5. In case you are stranded somewhere if traveling in a car, do lock all the windows and call the police.  In case of 2 wheeler, just ditch it or ride with punctured tire to nearest petrol pump, toll, shop. 

6. Never travel alone in an inebriate state. 

Please add your suggestions.

Edit : Stranded not strangled",killer_unkill," This illusion of control is just that, an illusion. Even a guy wouldn’t be able to defend himself against a group intent on overpowering him. I don't know about safety but if you need to pass critical information in case of emergencies you can use Automate app. It's an automation app you can do things with minimal interaction. You can also add shortcuts to your home screen, so with one tap you can automate hell lot of things. I use it daily and it's a huge time saver for me. So during emergencies where every second is crucial you can use that time to send as much as information to your friends and family members. There are countless ideas on how you can use this app. You play with this app for sometime and you will get it.

It's a powerful app so use it with caution. Check the child lock, before getting into cab Also protest, demand action. Hold the authorities accountable. 

Educate men. Speak out against lewd behavior, in person and whenever it's portrayed in media. 

Avoid traveling alone in the night, especially in insecure areas. Request a colleague to accompany you if it's unavoidable. 

Learn self defense or carry weapons.

But most important of all, do not give up your liberty. Most sexual violence is also intended to subjugate women and lower than standing in society. Fight for equality and your rightful place in society. It's sad to see the focus on totally different things in  the moment of tragedy. No way a girl can overcome more than two guys unless she is a champion boxer or mixed martial artist. Instead of asking for police and judicial reforms and 911 like helpline number our focus is on how to make women learn self defense. As far as pepper spray is concerned, here are some tips

* Make sure there is no wind blowing towards you
* Use it on the face of the suspect and flee immediately.
* practice on a dummy in your balcony
* Keep it in a keychain or somewhere easily accessible 
* If a security person asks what it is, you can say it is pocket deodorant, etc. &#x200B;

1. If you are a concerned citizen and know of dark/scary/hostile regions in your neighhborhood, don’t wait for a rape to happen to make that space safe. It is immensely rewarding to fix lights and increase patrol before something bad happens (personal experience).
2. If you know of any assaulters/rapists in your friend group, ensure that everyone you know knows about them and they know they will always be watched. Don’t bother with public opinion and ‘women ruin lives with lies’ BS, keeping friends safe is key.
3. If you find out that your friends have been harassed or assaulted, ensure that anyone who victim-blames them, or tries to discuss things they ‘could’ have done to prevent shit is shown the door. Women spend hours anxious about their safety anyway, next steps are more important than ‘what ifs’. Keep names of legal advisors and therapists handy.
4. If your  friend/ relative was assaulted as a child by some who is still a favoured relative/ family friend, it is never to late for them to speak their truth. Support your person thought their journey, ensure that such predators don’t ever prey on young people ever again. Keep an eye on them, publicly.
5. If you are at a wedding which serves alcohol, and notice rowdy behaviour, call it out. Yes, it’s someone else’s joyful occasion, but drunken assaulters use alcohol, crowds and people’s hesitation to strike. Alert a few sober people and create a subtle surveillance system around people who ""aren't in control"".
6. People who survive assault/rape may have PTSD. Ensure that your responses to news on sexual harassment, rape and abuse doesn’t make them feel like shit. It will make you part of their support system.
7. Be the kind of human whose vulnerable friends would be comfortable and trusting enough to stay over with. It saves lives.

This is what I have to do, and have had to do. Carry a small concealable surgical blade. make perpendicular slits. Carry a small knife and learn how to use it, learn how to use it and run away as quickly as you can.

https://youtu.be/BxoScSOkCCs People have many good suggestions did not see this so adding one here ... of course if under threat you need to reach out support : family friends or 100. Assuming you have notified and are waiting for help to arrive and the bad folks have still not gotten to a stage where you are overpowered, start Facebook live or live-streaming. At least what happened or parts of it will be available to people to get some clues and you can also use it to tell the bad guys that your picture is now on internet.

While trying to capture either video or photos, make sure they are direct to internet (will need to set up your settings before hand) and you take a picture of the area as well as people, to the extent you can. Whenever my wife is alone in cab late nights she always calls me and keeps talking to me loudly throughout the ride. She gives driver hints like I am a man and I will meet her at drop point. Also, she shares live location on whatsapp and I keep looking at it from time to time. If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car, kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy. The driver won't see you, but everybody else will. This has saved lives. I carry a Swiss army knife which my brother taught me to use (I still don't feel confident but hey its there). 
On my phone (through Google maps) have set up location sharing with 2  people. 
When taking an uber, have set up sharing of location. 
I make it a point to inform my family the minute I start from and towards my home.
I always make it a point to call someone (or even fake call) the minute I am in an auto or car and day how much time roughly it will take me and that they can track me.
When on my bike, I am with other bikers so not alone. And we travel long distance but not after sundown. I understand the post's positive intention, but it is heart-breaking  that one has to do so much to just to stay safe and to carry on with their life, pursue their dreams and to live a normal existence in a 'society'. Learn how you could use a ball pen, always keep a metal ball pen, target his eyes. In times of puncture, do not ever worry about it damaging your bike, it will cause very minute damage, but that is totally worth than putting your life in danger. You can go miles with your both tires punctured (Not sure if you can go faster). 
I myself have driven my bike on a road trip after getting front tire punctured and the nearest village was 2-3 km away. NOTHING!!!

All those precautions you have listed have time and again be used by different women throughout this country. It is already a stifling atmosphere for women here and I will not blame them for migrating to other countries if they get the chance.

As a man I have always loved my independence and the ability to just backpack and go somewhere on my own. I have seldom thought what it is from the point of view of a woman and these recent sexual assault incidents just show a side of India which I have not personally experienced. 

I am of the belief that death sentence and castration should be given to rapists especially for gang rape type incidents. I have heard many times that death sentences don’t act as a deterrent especially from law enforcement and human rights morons in this country but they are wrong.

Death really does act as a deterrent especially with regard to the typical Indian male. To be frank, the average Indian man is timid. He doesn’t have the courage to stand up for himself and doesn’t have the courage to fight for his rights. When such an individual is interacting with the opposite sex, he feels somewhat of an unknown power because in his mind women are of the weaker sex and come what may he will have power over her. When such men group together, it can lead to disastrous consequences. That is why gang rape is mostly a phenomenon of South Asian countries and few war torn African countries.

These same Indian men go to foreign countries such as the Middle East and Europe but they avoid doing the same there. Why? Because they have fear of the law. 

Our judicial system is overseen by old men and women who can be called dinosaurs in this day and age. It’s all nice for the liberal elite to copy the practices of foreign countries debating whether death penalty is ethical or not while forgetting the demographic differences between the people of our country and foreigners especially with regarding to race , iq and upbringing. Let’s face it.. most Indians are uncivilized and therefore for uncivilized people stringent laws are applicable. Barring instances of being innocently charged, we could do with some culling of the population, especially some men. Emigrate. Love how the conversation after a catastrophic incident is always about ""how not to get raped"" ""how to defend yourself against rapists"" instead ya know.... the initiators of the horrific acts. Best they can do is fuck off from this awful country and settle to some other where they aint seen as  consumable . Asking women to take safety precautions is fine but the real way to stop rapes is to well ,stop men from raping.

&#x200B;

Unpopular opinion but we need to make an example out of the perpetrators of these vicious crimes. You can say this is my outrage but these perpetrators do not deserve human rights since they have proved by their acts that they do not deserve to be called human. I am not suggesting a mob lynching here but the law must be extremely strict for rape in this country. People need to know that if they commit rape, they will be found out and they will be reprimanded severely . Further all the netas who have rape cases against them need to be brought to book. We need to set the example that no matter how high and mighty you are, rape in India is a serious offence.

And of course mental health. Being exposed to pornography and item songs in a society where  conversations about sex are taboo is another reason why there are so many rapes in India. We need a sex education and mental health programmme that has better outreach.

The outraged me says- Chauk pe khada kar saalo ko, baaki sab hum dekh lenge. Honest question. Are tasers legal in India? Migrate from India One most important thing to always remember is, as the minister said, call the police the moment you feel unsafe. Don't worry about false alarms. Better a thousand false alarms than a tragedy. Similarly, if you are the woman's relative, call the police immediately if her phone is switched off. 

Don't go by the bad reputation of the police. The corrupt judgemental assholes in the police are a lot better than the soulless demons on the streets. Practice running. Sprint, as well as long runs. They can't do much if they can't catch you. \>> Never travel alone in an inebriate state. 

There are a lot more common-sense tips like this one could mention. The flip-side of pointing out the obvious is to attract trolls! I gave my wife a pocket alarm sorta thing. No larger than your car key, this thing makes very loud/annoying noise when active, and it is pretty difficult to find the off switch (by design) for someone who is not familiar with it. Hope she never have to use it. I think self defence should be made mandatory in all schools & colleges. Please consider getting trained professionally if you can afford. Or practice at home if it's not affordable. Our body tends to freeze if we are not trained. We need to build a bit of muscle memory and mental alertness. We rarely have the time to think in such situations. 

I am sorry you have to go through this. I really am. Well I didn’t mention upper cut because it kind of takes time to learn. It’s essentially doing a really quick squat . But yeah if you can learn the upper cut in the right way, you can certainly KO someone. A few months ago while sparring my partner mistakenly landed an upper cut to my family jewels. I had a cup but holy shit it still hurt. So yeah I’d say upper cut to the chin or groin will also be great. I am in Manila, Philippines at the moment and the women are free to roam everywhere anytime of the day or night wearing what they like. India is definitely a few light years behind in this context. Adding one. Please check your phone for SOS features. Most of the current ones do have one, where, in case of emergency, you press the power button certain number of times to immediately alert your preset contacts of your whereabouts and that you need help. In Xiaomi phones, the setting is there under Password and Security. Also, avoid the outskirts of your towns and cities if possible, as those areas are primarily occupied by people who don't have a future and aren't afraid of any consequences to their action. matlab bencho apni protection ke liye bhi unko hi mehnat karni padegi. ye sikho, ye rakho kya zindagi hai ye I think you meant stranded instead of strangled.

Should probably add getting a concealed carry permit & learning how to use said weapon. I'm not advocating vigilante justice or random shootings by scared civilians but I'd much rather hear about 5 instances of rapists getting their faces shot off in one day than 5 horrific & abominable instances of rape.

Seriously, I've been in such a shitty mood after reading about the poor girl in Hyd & the police finding another body in similar circumstances literally a couple of hours later. Just absolutely sickened. For once, due process should take a back seat & scum should be treated as such. Leave the country if they can. Some self defense can help in a 1 on 1 situation but it’s better to avoid a potential situation altogether. Even a single vulnerable male cannot prevent a robbery or assault.
The only force equalizer is a gun which can take a few of the attackers out of the reckoning but that is a different discussion.
Until then, stay in populated areas and have someone pick you up or call for help. Not many people know this but on your Ola app, there's an option which can automatically send all your rider information and your cab's real time location to your friends/family when you've booked one. Upto 5 people can be selected I think and they'll get an sms as soon as you book a ride which also has things like the cab's number, driver's name and number, etc

EDIT: I think uber has the same feature but you have to do it manually after every booking. Someone please correct me if there's an automatic option 1) Realise wanting safe streets is not a women's safety issue, it's a public safety issue.

2) Realize our society and injustice system is misogynistic and patriarchal and will not help us. 

3) Become active in an org. that works to keep our streets safe like blank noise  

4) Get fit. Lift weights.  

5) Learn one martial art.

6)  Carry pepper spray/ stun gun/ taser, rape whistle. Learn to use them  

7) Get angry, not scared Educate men around you, as many as you can. The onus shouldn't be on women to go out and learn martial arts - it should be on society to not have rapists at large. I think you have pretty much covered. We need to make all the six points you have mentioned as a practice. It's terrible how we just skip the part of tackling evil in men when we are talking about this. Women shouldn't be forced to take extra steps for safety. Men need to be better than unempathetic animals. It's a sad thing to see to that we just accept evil in men as a given. It's not the women's fault, it's the men's. 

Here is the only rule that matters:

Be better at bringing up men. Be better yourself. When you hear friends casually catcalling someone, speak up. Tell them that's what potential rapists do. Sure, you might be firm in your conviction that you could never do something like that. BUt by not saying anything, you are complicit. You are the reason why toxic masculinity continues to exist. It isn't because of the evil men, it's because of men who aren't evil not saying anything. BE BETTER. I thought tasers weren't legal. I might have missed something. Can you buy taser in India 5. Always a nightmare,thank God. Honestly I don't like it but guns are the only solution.  Quick and easy. Carry a lighter and deodorant. Trust your guts if you feel unsafe. Leave the place with a good friend or family member if available. 

If nobody is there then simply sent your current location to family members and do live call video with anybody and speak out loud and tell them where you are in it. Also go to public place as fast as possible if you think you are in danger. where exactly do you get off telling me how to behave. Delete this post now if you have a single brain cell. Smash patriarchy. Trying to raise better sons would be a really good place to start. But of course, we're now going to teach women how to become superhuman. See a few videos on Pressure points for self defence Leave the country Put curfew on men after day light! 

Im tired of seeing posts on preventive measures women should take after every heinous incident like this. EVERY FUCKING TIME  we find a shortcoming in how the woman in question could have protected herself. But the onus is on men to learn how to not reduce women to mere objects and respect their autonomy. Just taking precautions does not help! Rapes happen even at home! The responsibility is on parents, schools and higher education institutions to inculcate manners! Yes manners, to learn how NOT to behave. We have been very good as a society to teach girls how to be a good wife, daughter, student or career woman etc. But clearly a large population of men has an IOTA of brains on how to treat others (especially woman) with dignity!!! I hope it doesn't get lost, but there is an app called #life360 . It sends a very accurate location, and has sos, and will update your family
Haven't tried the second idea but if you end up in a really dire situation, call the police. they may or may not pick up, i hope it never comes to it, but just try. Self defence is really a chance thing. You can't ninja through 5-6 men who are really tough. I hope it never comes to that? Individual solution is not an answer to problems which impacts mass, for example people are installing water and air purifier for individual needs but it doesn't solve the problem at aggregate level and you will always have carry filtered water bottle, purchase package bottle at a price in which you get 20X litres and wear masks all the time. It goes same in women’s safety. Answer is mass protest by women and more women in public safety force. India has most strignent law regarding women safety, still we hear rape incidents every week, why because womens are not raising voice which can shake the country to its core. India has 48.20% female popluation still lacks all majority women party. No men majority political party will hear your needs, like present government thinks sanitary pads are luxury and they taxed them. Enough of rant, always carry pepper spray, emergency alert app, learn jiu jitsu and strength training. Lastly you should able run fast if group tries to attack you. Peace. Don't be a woman. Lift weights and learn to fight. The Quran has a lot of tips for women’s safety.
1. Wear a veil
2. Have a male relative as an escort while going out or travelling.
3. Do not interact with men who are not family.
4. Convert to Islam.",2019-11-30 09:35:12

What are your thoughts. And how to best handle the situation",internetyogi," When folks who do not understand your native language is nearby, it is always better to converse in a common language like English..

Some of them do not mind it, but there are folks who could take it wrong.. Depends on the situation, if it's just the 2 of you then I guess it's ok. But if other people are in the conversation then please speak in a common language. This applies not only with foreigners but with fellow Indians as well.

Have a few malyali friends and whenever they are together they talk only in malyalam and completely leave me out of any common interaction. It's got to the point that I automatically leave when I see 2 or more of them together and refuse to go out with them. Take the extra effort and talk to him in a language everyone understands. Restrict native language usage to only when you're alone.

Obviously, it's going to be easier to converse in your native tongue, but that's what setting an inclusive work environment entails. From your neutral-speaking colleagues’ perspective, it does not feel good to be left out. In the long term it will lead to resentment towards you two.

But does India have what is needed to move to becoming a high income country? Any information and discussion will be appreciated.",OnidaKYGel," A high income country is one where gross national income per capita is more than $12,000.

The main challenges to getting this done is twofold:

1) Population. With such a large population, $12k per capita means 12k * 1.2 billion = $14 trillion economy in terms of income alone. By way of comparison, most economists think that getting to a $5 trillion economy will be a challenge given current economic conditions.

2) Skill. High income countries tend to have skilled manufacturing and services as a large proportion of their income earning population. India has technology* but it’s not as widespread as a proportion of the population.

Also having a high proportion of skilled industries and workers requires really good primary, secondary and tertiary education. India has historically under-invested in primary and secondary education and chosen to focus on highly selective tertiary education — the IITs and the IIMs, etc. This leads to great outcomes for the few who get into those but it doesn’t move the needle in terms of national income stats.

\* Many will argue that India does very little cutting edge work here, instead focusing on subcontracting for MNCs or replicating business models proven abroad. But I’m ignoring that for the purposes of this discussion. We are bound to be in the Middle-Income trap and there is nothing this or any other government can do?

Our women LFPR (labor force participation rate) is around 30% whereas we should be in high 60-70s at least. But the problem is while women LFPR increased due to families wanting additional income to get out of poverty, as soon as income of family increases, LFPR decreases - i.e. women participation in labor is temporary to supplant additional income on a temporary basis. This is a recipe for a middle-income trap.

This is an excellent research paper on the same - very revealing

https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/understanding-indias-middle-income-trap/1604557/ we aren't even middle income... more like a low income trap Why do you care about this shit? Here are single variables you can care about,

- Mean years of schooling/ Infant mortality rate/ Maternal mortality rate/ Average life expectancy/ Prevalence of underweight, malnutrition, stunting among <5/ Prevalence of anaemia/ diseases through vitamin/mineral deficiency etc/ Gender imbalances in population or different groups of the population

India cannot become a high income country. If it did become one the environmental impact on the world of forcing a 1 billion people into western European levels of consumption would be catastrophic. The kind of economic/social/political convulsion which would happen if India pursued that would be horrible.

The transformation of moving away from 40% engaged in agriculture to 1-2% (developed country levels) would be unbelievably catastrophic.

India should not do any of these non sense, it needs to follow a Sustainable developmental agenda which can expand the positive liberty of the people. Which is something more than expanding peoples consumption levels.

> middle income trap

Best guesses of a middle income trap happens when a country which was growing because of cheap labour based export policy when it comes close to the technology frontier is unable to move to technology based growth policy.

Neither should we care about growth through export of cheap labour nor about ""technology policies"" (basically an euphemism for providing public goods which private entities can make rival and legal framework from which private can make excludable goods from) China or Brazil like per capita income is within the reach of India if we play our cards right.

Let's brainstorm on the solution

I can only think of two possible solutions:

&#x200B;

1. Limit government officials carrying cash per day to 2000, unless they can show legitimate proof, ACB can raid them and seize all unaccounted cash.
2. Nobody may pass above act, what we can do is take snapshot of all 500/-, 1000/- 2000/- notes while going out of home and if forced to bribe for no benefit, post snapshot of those notes and officer's name and location",satyasys," I think the AAP gov. has a whatsapp number where people can send videos of officials demanding bribes. I think something along those lines can be done. If one suspects that an official might demand a bribe then record them knowingly/unknowingly. For instance, always record the police officer who comes at your place for passport verification. Make it known from the get-go that you're recording. I reckon he won't dare ask for a bribe then. Your Both solutions are appreciable but have certain flaws.
The first one is simply arbitrary, unreasonable and you can't go against a person who has been hiding all the money all this long. Plus the ACB raid part is the biggest flaw coz both the parties will collude and bribe and consolidate each other.

The second one is again a very tiresome and could be easily misused an official who is rightfully doing his duty. Moreover reporting is not enough. People still report. Some even do sting operation and provide whole videos as evidence but the officials with their incredible influence and power simply escape any retribution.

Now for the solution part - As much as I understand as a Son of an IPS Officer and having seen this class of people for almost my whole life, the sole reason insufficiency.
You can't expect the top Bureaucrats who collectively run and maintain the whole nation on a small salary of 1 Lakh or so or sometimes even lesser.
What I mean is that they surely need much much more for the kind of life they aspire to live after qualifying the toughest exams and service they give to the nation. 

So basically the best stratagem would be to increase their Pay( In a reasonable but also sufficient for that class) and give them better services so that they don't have to that on the individual level (which everyone knows how they do that).

And Lastly trust me most of them don't even consider it a wrong coz they are just using the loopholes of law to benefit themselves (coz they are being treated really unfairly). And honestly I find their idea not very wrong(Don't get me wrong). I surely could be Biased. I made [long list of bribery cases](https://np.reddit.com/r/PassportIndia/comments/csifaa/corruption/) going on during passport verification process. Why common citizens have to pay bribe from ₹100 to ₹5000 for obtaining their passport?

I'm going to add more proofs, move them to [neocities](https://neocities.org) and then get in touch with [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/) - which is a global non-profit organization that issues ""Corruption Perceptions Index"" for about 176 countries and their purpose is to take action to combat global corruption. I'm sure they will definitely do something about it and bring positive outcome

Our politicians knows corruption exists in every Government department, but aren't serious to fight it. They want to introduce NPR, NRC and CAA, instead of tackling more important issues Forget bribes, atleast make all the department spending ledgers open.",2020-01-18 18:24:35

A visit to the doctor and a health report, just to show where they stand. Fear is a great motivator my friend, once they see how that unhealthy food takes a toll on them, then hopefully they’ll be open to what you have to propose with healthy eating. 

I hope it works out for you, we all want the best for our parents! :) As another comment mentioned, fear works. Just take them for a general check up and the doctor will list everything wrong with their body. But be wary of which hospital you go to, because these health check ups are usually their scam gateway to make you a customer for life, if you know what I mean. My dad complained of redness of eye and I thought it was an irritation. When it didn’t subside, he went to an eye specialist who said it was a blood vessel rupture. He was asked for his blood pressure, which turned out to be very high. The eye doctor told dad to immediately go to a doctor and get emergency hypertensive treatment. The doctor at the hospital said that my dads weight was a key culprit. Dad is now scared straight, at least for a little while to exercise and mind his diet. My father and grandpa used to smoke cigarette. When I was 6, I started taking their cigarettes and tried to imitate them.  They stopped cigarette after that issue.   


Many of older generation have gone through tough life and they really don't worry about these things. They do care about kids than them and that is one of the reason they have unrealistic expectations about the kids.

Easemytrip has some really useful coupon codes. Also, you could directly check in the airlines website. Preferably indigo or air aisa.

I have a budget of max 4 lac. 
I will mostly be using it in the the city and taking it on long trips (~300km) once a month. 
I prefer a comfortable seating stance rather than an aggressive one (I am 5ft11in tall). Pillion comfort is welcome but optional.

I would love to hear recommendations.",sattyrox," I'm extremely biased towards the KTM Duke (both 200 & 390) as I've exclusively used the D200 as a daily commuter for the past couple of years. It is such a blast to ride, handles well, fuel economy is not absurd, looks pretty as hell and the riding position is quite comfortable. 

I will say the new RE Interceptor 650 is a fun motorcycle as well. you may check Yamaha R3, Ninja 300, Benelli 302 r - all most upright Positions they offer. So No trouble for long rides. other than that you have got Dominar,390 Adventure, Interceptor 650. i would suggest you to take a twin cylinder. Ride Safe, Buy Riding Gear too The Duke 390 is probably the most fun bike in that price range. If you are into drag racing, look no further. It’s not for everyone though with its boy racerish looks. 

The Interceptor, though slightly slower, is more relaxed thanks to its larger engine at similar horsepower levels.  If you are into classic looking bikes, this is the one to have. 

For Indian riding conditions (read potholes), I recommend an adventure motorcycle such as the soon to be launched KTM adventure 390 or the BMW 310 GS. 

Happy motoring D390, Interceptor 650, Husqvarna Vitpilen 250

I have driven pre-facelift D390. I found its ergonomics pretty bad. Continental GT 650, BMW G310 or Duke 390 For long trips and comfy seating don't look beyond ADVs. The BMW 310GS or the newly launched KTM 390 adventure. The Dominar is also a good option. Sports and Nakeds have thin seats and the legs are angled backwards than upright in ADVs. Ktm 390 adv but keep in mind they really heat a lot in traffic it's quite uncomfortable to ride in city but the highways it's a breeze. Another vote for ADVs.

Over the last few years, I have been earning a lot more money than before and I want to use some of it to help others who aren't as fortunate.

Currently I am sponsoring the education for 2 siblings with a single mother and few other small donations which I don't even need twice to say yes to. 

Most appeals for financial help that I come across on social media are well within my means to help, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to spend my money. 

This post  is mostly to help me decide what kind of efforts I should be funding. So I can set aside funds for such causes and whenever I come across an appeal, I shouldn't have to think about whether I should donate or how much etc. 

I would like to donate to things that can significantly change people's lives for the better. (Beyond just helping them survive/maintain status quo.)

Things I don't feel comfortable sponsoring, 
 - Expensive school education(pre-classX) for under privileged kids. (Expensive = 20-30k per annum, I don't mind funding someone's college education for a lot moret, but I feel  it's super expensive for school fees.) 
 - Expensive medical treatment for strangers with low chances of survival. (I'm conflicted on this, but my thinking the same amount of money can help a lot more people instead of feeding into medical industry profits. I may think differently if it was a family member or close friend.)

AskIndia,[AskIndia] What are the chances of Andrew Yang winning US presidency and implications for India?,16,e5crx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5crx9/askindia_what_are_the_chances_of_andrew_yang/,21,While browsing youtube I got a couple of videos recommended to me about this dude named Andrew Yang. I liked the things he said so I was wondering what are the chances of him becoming the president? Will that be beneficial for India?,galaxyhermit42," His chances of winning are pretty close to 0 . Democratic Party already has their favorites of joe Biden and Kamala Harris

Edit: kamala has ended her run, so looks like joe Biden is your New Democratic candidate 😂. I would like Bernie but sadly I don’t think it’ll happen, he’s polling 3rd right now. His actual chances of winning should be close to what he’s polling—if the polls are accurate. I’m not sure how accurate they really can be, but if you assume they are accurate, then he has a 3-5% chance of winning.

The people who do support him (myself included) are pretty passionate about him, unlike those of most of the other candidates, and that can go a long way since they are more willing to spend their money and put time in to helping the campaign. They also are more likely to talk about him to people they meet, which is a big plus for him since most people in the USA don’t know anything about him generally those who find out about him like him a lot—and this includes democrats, republicans, and independents.

For Yang to move from 3-5% in the polls to winning would not be unprecedented: in January 1976 Jimmy Carter (who also had a very small but dedicated group of supporters) was polling at 4%, and later that year won the presidency. Lots of Yang supporters are pushing for a similar strategy to that of Carter: increase name recognition, focus efforts on early voting states, and push into the front of the pack by winning or doing well there.

A ma for the effects of a Yang presidency on India: it’s hard to predict the future, but I’d say it looks positive.

Yang’s demeanor toward foreign policy is summed up with goals like “Make it harder for the United States to get involved in foreign engagements with no clear plan or goal” and
“Rebuild our relationships with allies to strengthen the international order.” I would say that these kinds of policies (vs the warmongering and meddling that has been done frequently by the USA much of the time during my lifetime) will bring stability to the world stage, and stability is good for everyone except for people who can profit off of war and people who live in a politically toxic/dangerous country. I would like to see a USA that doesn’t bomb anyone or kill anyone in any other country, and encourages other countries to do the same by example (rather than by force).
Immigration is another area that Yang is very open on (especially compared to Trump) and so that puts Indian citizens who want access to the USA in a good place with Yang as president.
Finally, every American getting $1,000/month under a Yang presidency would be great for Yang. It’s unlikely to cause inflation according to economists who have studied it. According to the White House (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/fact-sheet-united-states-india-prosperity-partnership/) in 2017 there were 7 lakh American citizens living in India. Assuming even 80% of them are adults, that means 48208 Crores per year of spending power coming in to India (7,00,000 US citizens * 80% adults * $1,000 * 12 months per year * 71.73 rupies/dollar = ₹4,82,08,27,20,000). That must be a good thing for the Indian economy.

If you look at Yang’s policies page, there are more than 100 very detailed policies and I’m sure lots more would affect India. Have a look here: https://www.yang2020.com/policies/ Who is the most talked-about guy in the US election? The murmurs in the wind can be positive or negative but whose name you hear the most will win. 

I am not hearing any solid names in this US election. ^(Except for Trump who has no chance of returning, I guess?) Its gonna be trump

Dont care who the people votes for, its still gonna be trump. Andrew Yang is a lightweight, you’re seeing his ads because his campaign probably wasn’t specific enough with the target demographics in digital ad spend. But my question to you is are you already in the US or did you get to see his ad in India?

There’s a hilarious story about another fringe candidate who’s dumped shitloads of money into ads so much that it’s pissed off the voters in an upcoming primary state. Close to zero.

I'd love if Yang and Gabbard joined forces with Bernie.

That would be dope.

As far as implications for India, well, none of the US Prez candidates have soft spots for Indians as such.

However, due to our population and economy (yes, despite the downturns), good geopolitical relations will have to be maintained.",2019-12-03 14:12:48

The transactions drained his account with 40K balance to 0

He reached out the bank, and going to the police. Has anyone been in this situation, what we can do to recover money quickly. 

Any advice is highly appreciated

BTW this is in Bangalore",prtthrowaway," I ll copy paste one of my previous comments-


According to RBI's guidelines, the liability falls on your bank if the fault is of 3rd Party that is neither you nor the bank, but only if you inform within 3 days. So, if it's not your fault then it doesn't matter what the manager has to say about recovery. If they can't, then also they will have to bear the burden.

For your reference, point 6(ii) in attached pdf

Limiting Liability of Customers in Unauthorised Electronic ... - RBI PDF

https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI15D620D2C4D2CA4A33AABC928CA6204B19.PDF

>Third party breach where the deficiency lies neither with the bank nor with the customer but lies elsewhere in the system, and the customer notifies the bank within three working days of receiving the communication from the bank regarding the unauthorised transaction.

Were those withdrawals cash withdrawals? If yes, then you have a stronger case because the card was with you and thus fault must lie within the system/bank.

Also point 9 and point 12 are extremely important-

>9) On being notified by the customer, the bank shall credit (shadow reversal) the amount involved in the unauthorised electronic transaction to the customer’s account within 10 working days from the date of such notification by the customer (without waiting for settlement of insurance claim, if any).

Burden of proof.

>12) The burden of proving customer liability in case of unauthorised electronic banking transactions shall lie on the bank.

My opinion: You must inform everything to the bank in writing and you must get a receiving. After doing this, you should ask them for the resolution. If the resolution offered by them is not optimal for you, then you should show the bank RBI guidelines and put pressure on them. Which bank is this? Has he used the card or account online? What was the mode of transaction?
Is a simple money transfer or money is used to buy any goods ?

Share the SMS with us. Did he activate and use  internet banking facilities with the hacked account? Always keep international transactions for the card disabled. Enable only when you need to use it. Phishing scam, probably entered his card details at a fake website page some time back. These transactions are usually carried around midnight in India during weekends, they don't require OTP, even a front and back picture of your card will do. Could be that he gave his card to swipe at a store and they stored his info and sold it later. You will never know, you won't be able to trace the transactions as it takes place outside India. Transaction usually takes place in small batches of 2000-5000 rupees and to buy things online mostly. 

But since it is axis bank, your brother might get your money back. Stop using cards online or even offline, use cash or UPI. From my experience, you should raise the issue with the bank and ensure you block the card. 

A piece of advice I would give to all people who use cards online is to use credit cards because the protections offered are way higher and it is also easier for banks to block fraudulent txns. This has happened to me also, I got a call trying to confirm a txn worth 50K on my CC, told her to block the card, they sent a new card and txn was never allowed to go through. Banks usually call you if you spend >25k at odd times or through not so know portals. Only once you confirm do they allow the final charge. The exact same thing happened to me a few months back,in Bangalore.
Had to file a complaint with the cyber police and then show the fir to the bank to get my money back. Took nearly 5-6 weeks for the money back tho.
This was a huge scam that affected a lot of people at the same time actually.
It probably happened due to this thing called ""card skimming"".
If you're not fluent with kannadiga, always get someone who is,when you go to the police station.I did that and got the work done in 2 hours which otherwise would've taken 6(I was asked to wait that long initially)
Hope this helps Lot of such cases recently....they get access to your phone no. Connected to bank...deactivate it and connect a new one and withdraw funds

Also there're tons of websites to book for the trek? What are your reviews if you used them? Which is the best one?

Thanks.",IronHulk42," Indiahikes is the best one in my experience. Haven't tried any other operator though. I have done brahmatal with Indianhikes. Although we never completed it fully due to bad weather, I cherish every moment.
It was my first. Somewhere late March can't remember. You have to go when it begins to stop snowing alot. I dunno how reasonable it is to go on a beginner hike in Himalayas in winter. Maybe better to wait till spring or summer. I have done Kedarkantha winter trek, go with Indiahikes and never with Thrillophillia, it's physically very tiring unless your body can get acclimatized to low levels of oxygen faster. Workout, make sure you are healthy and fit to do the trek. It'll be super cold. I lived in Himachal from Dec '17 - March '18. I was shivering non-stop till February. If this is your first time trekking, I wouldn't advice it. If you are a good trekker, you can do it easily because your body will be able to take the cold. Kedarkanth is alright for beginners but snow and cold changes the dynamics completely. 

If this is your first trek, I will also suggest Triund in Mcloedganj (easiest) or Tungnath/Chandrashilla Peak in Chopta (challenging for beginners but doable) which are shorter than Kedarkanth and has great effort to reward ratio.

Try going with a small group instead of a large provider like Indiahikes etc. so you can control your own pace and not feel like you are lagging behind. You can find a guide locally once you reach the place. I am also planning Brahmatal trek on 2nd week of February.",2019-11-20 18:34:36

The founder has acknowledged the same multiple times but my actual requests for a raise has been dodged. 

Today we were having another 1-to-1 meeting where we talking about general work stuff and he mentioned it again. But upon asking more he said, ""he will think through it"" and I will get it ""in due time"". 

We are a small team of 6 people. Recently the business took a hit due to some policy changes and we were asked to work 10x harder and ""stay committed"". The project that is usually delivered is 2-3 months, we were able to deliver it in record 12 days. The project that I was assigned was deemed important before starting out but upon completion it was labelled as ""less important"". The other two projects are at 70% and 40% completion at the end of 20 days and are apparently more important than my project. 

Now we usually get a Flipkart or other voucher as Diwali ""bonus"" but looking at the situation, I'm not very keen on accepting it. 

It is very clear that he is stalling my requests and I'm being shafted big time. I have turned down 5 offers to stay in the current job because I was ""committed"" but looks like it isn't worth it. The last offer was 2 months ago and paid 2x more.

Because it just feels so wrong.",HistoricalPotential1," Loyalty is overrated. Atleast in the IT sector. If you get a 2x offer, take it and run! don't make any petty moves out of emotions. look at the big picture. look for better opportunities at other places. Accept the diwali gift and say thank you along with a return gift. One of the best career advices I've got it is :

""The company owes you nothing and you owe the company nothing "".

It's just business. Nobody else will take care of you other than yourself.

I've followed this advice religiously. And I must say that I've never regretted it. Take what you get and find another job. Tell him that you are not celebrating diwali this year because there is too much work to do at the office. Why not accept the gift and you make a gift to him too. That way you won't feel bad when you leave. This sounds too much like me. Being ""too committed"" to the company, not getting enough raises, small team working overtime, rejecting better paying offers due to ""loyalty"".  
Well now I've much better sense and I'm resigning tomorrow, after getting 2 better offers. Resign before Diwali and directly say no for it. > The last offer was 2 months ago and paid 2x more 

Should have taken it, given you had the intention of leaving this current job and going to the one you got the offer from. Anyway, take the Diwali card I would say.",2019-10-18 03:01:39

EDIT2: Yes, The Bonus actually isn't bad. There's an argument for it. But I'll leave it here, as a testament to my own fallibility. And because ""phaavda leke.. "" sounds badass.",MauryanEmperor," I've trained for 5.5 years in NCR, hopping gyms every 6-12 months. I've been to some cheap gyms (INR 800/month) and been to some relatively expensive chains (bomiso, anytime fitness) and one thing is pretty common - the trainers all suck.   


In fact, in my experience, the most knowledgeable gym trainer I've met was at the cheapest gym - he owned the gym, and was running it in the basement of an actual residence.   


Here's how I've learnt to deal with the pseudo-trainers:   
1. Make them know their place: They're there to help you *if and only if you ask for help.* You've paid for the membership, which means you can use the equipment. You're under no obligation to listen to 'trainers'.   
2. Be courteous, but distant with them. Say ""I have my routine, I'm doing this."" Many trainers will just leave you alone, thinking you already have another plan, or know more than them (which is actually very probable)  
3. Follow your routine to a T, so you can impress the same guys with your results, in silence.   


Best of luck! I've been going gym since 2008 and have trained quite a lot of people for free, I can confirm that majority of trainers don't even know the names and proper form of exercise. Let alone talking about compound and isolation exercises. Gyms don't have a degree requirement so every gym bro or even a newbie can apply to become a trainer and then keep fucking up everyone else body. That's just exercise. Most of the people don't even know about nutrition and stuff. They will just point you to the nearest supplement counter. The deadlift one is actually correct. It's called a mixed grip, it improves stability and prevents the barbell from slipping. You need to alternate your underhand and overhand when using mixed grip so that you don't develop muscle imbalance. ""It's damn hot, can you turn on the AC?""  

""It's good if it's hot, you'll sweat more so become thinner.""  

WTF.png I got lucky when I started going to gym where there was a trainer in his 40s who knew almost everything there is about fitness that was in 2010. And now in Bangalore these trainers literally doesn't even know to teach pushups in correct form. Be careful when you choose to join a gym. Any should or knee joint issues will affect you throughout your life. Dude ,I have been lifting for 3 years and have even helped my friends in transformation,till now I have not seen a single trainer or even a competitor who knows his shit. I have even trained with Mr.UP and he doesn't know shit about training. These people are complete jackass . Most of these guys use PEDs told to them by some trainer and then suffer. You can check tarun Gill's channel on YouTube and not even 1 competitor knew his shit,1 of them was telling to stop bathing before competition. [deleted] I've been to 3 gyms in Bangalore including cult fitness and yes the trainers don't know shit. I would have got tendinitis if I continues with the cult fitness class. To be honest most of our workforce except the creamy layer need to be trained and retrained. This is the pain which comes with a growing nation. For instance, try looking for a handyman who is competent. It's really hard, or they are already working for a big company. The money they get from the jobs is also not so high so they don't put their heart and soul into this so they can make things better. Hopefully with growth of economy our country's workforce skills also grow up I used to go to a gym for a while (2014-15) and one of the trainers straight up told me to take some steroids cause I'm too skinny. Optimum nutrition



😂😂 True that. 

A lot of trainers focus on unnecessary things or sound phony asf. 

From what I've seen, Cult seems to carry some good trainers with good certifications.

Most of all, all the trainers that I've visited or seen are self made, they built a good body and then became a trainer because of the money. 
So they don't exactly know the scientific way but the way that worked for them. 

Either way, I see most Indians go through a lot of YouTube channels and blogs and pick what suits them best. 

My buffy buddies are all from the same method. I have gone to some form of gym for the past 4-5 years. For 2 years, when I went to the normal gym, I was doing squats wrong and no one told me about this (I dont know if it is because they didnt know or because of not giving a fuck since they are underpaid).  And many of them focus on isolation exercises and not compound or functional exercises which is a huge problem. 

I went to a functional fitness (not crossfit but similar) gym 3 years ago and that is where I came to know about Squats, Deadlift etc. But here too, the main trainer knows his stuff well while others do not. 

These trainers are also trying to sell either protein powder or dietician none of which I wanted. This is because they are earning about 15-25k per month (which is quite less for the amount of hours they put in tbh). These trainers make their money from personal training and hence maybe the lack of interest that you see around. 

Another important thing that all gyms across the country lack is their ignorance of cooldown. Most gyms do not focus on cooldown while those that do, do not spend more than 10 mins. I learnt it the hard way by going to the physiotherapist and spending 5k for rehabilitation. 

Currently, I go to the gym in my building itself. the trainer there is good, but doesnt know enough compound exercises. 

IMO, if you are looking at only fitness and have no huge goals, you can workout at home itself because there are a lot of online channels posting workout videos. All you need is a pair of dumbells  and a mat. Have been lifting for over 6 years, this should come as no surprise to you, there’s no regulation. 

Unfortunately you’re going to have to do your own homework on the internet and use your head to navigate the bro-science. 

While I lived in bombay I used to go to Nitrro, the membership was quite steep but the trainers knew their stuff there. But for the most part elsewhere, for sure, clueless. Certified trainers anywhere in the world will cost a fortune!

I have been working out for a long time without a trainer, using my own routine and have had fairly good results.

I recommend sites such as scoobys workshop (funny name but totally worth it) and the forums of bodybuilding dot com. The thing to keep in mind is that it takes time to build muscle and get sustainable results. There is no quick solution and any person giving quick results is either a liar or will end up hurting you. Yes. As with all fields in India which are technical.

If any of you want to learn to lift or whatever, just go to [https://startingstrength.com/](https://startingstrength.com/) Welcome bro. I use Jim wendlers routine which you can find online or buy his book. And use my trainer mostly as a spotter so that I don’t go bad form and break my back. I think that’s the best way to use Indian trainers and yes creating a routine and dieting wise they all suck according to me. This really depends on the franchise gym you go to. 

&#x200B;

Background : I used to go to Gold's gym in Chennai (think it was the first branch they opened in the country) and the trainers were all top notch. Even in Maverick's (FLUX now, I think) the trainers knew what they were talking about, and a good proportion of them were looking to get further certifications in the fitness industry. 

&#x200B;

I suppose it's a pretty banal case of you get what you pay for. The fitness industry, like a host of other industries, that have arrived in India needs some time to mature I suppose. The bonus isn't that bad. Pros usually deadlift with a mixed grip, it prevents the bar from slipping too much when compared to a double overhand grip. That's because when the bar starts to roll out of one hand, it rolls **into** the other.

Here are things the trainer at my gym said (I don't pay him, he's the owner too):

1. Heavy weights build size and no strength.
2. Do light weights with 25+ reps for fat loss.
3. Lat exercises reduce love handles
4. Side bends reduce love handles

People I know have had it worse than me. Their trainer made them do all machine workouts the first day, and full body workout every day for a month or so. And they went to posh gyms!

So yes, Indian trainers are pretty bad. Mainly because we don't have the level of education here which is possessed, or required to be possessed, by someone of that nature. Most here follow broscience of ""shock the muscle"". The trainer at my gym doesn't even know what Starting Strength and 5/3/1 are! Warming up has a lot of different connotations.

Warming up with lighter weights to practice form before the lifts? That's good.

Warming up by running on the treadmill for 10 minutes then practicing judo kicks for the next 10 before you actually pick up weights? Not productive. How to detect a bad trainer : Ask his opinion on leg curls and upright rows. If he approves of either of these, he's a bad trainer. Depends

I have been going to Gold Gym for last 4 years, and the one I train under is great

But it sucks for the wallet The body shape of most gym trainers in India says everything it has to about untrained gym trainers in India. Gym trainers in India are basically people who have spent a shit load of time in or around gyms I have seen quite a few trainers who don't know much but have somehow built a good physique, but there are also others I have met who REALLY know their shit as well as the science behind building muscles, something like the Athlean X guy. I'm never gonna forget the way one of them described chest exercises to me, the way they're supposed to be done...what people do wrong etc. Unfortunately that person rarely offers personal training and owns the gym lol Does anyone here know how good the cult.fit classes are? Especially the boxing classes? > Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

I have seen guys do that. what's the logic of doing that? I have foudn vice versa also, many people are not even willing to listen to sound advice, since sound advice requires working on form and technique. People in my gym do half squats without wanting to put in effort to master below parallel depth. Some do close grip bench with very close grip, fuck wrists. Lift arms all the up top in dumbbell rows. And despite my reasoning (some of these are friends), most just stay on, since they can lift heavier weights this way with poor form. People however flock to model/trainer in my gym who looks better than me :/. I dont know where you live but i live in vasai and in my local gym there are certified trainers. I have been training for more than 7 years . Most of the trainers  who are certified are always looking for clients because they earn more throught clients than spending more amount of time being employed inthe gym. My advice is do your research. If you are willing to invest time and money in the gym you should invest some time in picking up a routine and progressively overload. Most trainers suck. They offer diet advice even when they know they are not supposed to. They don't understand that rep range depends upon fitness and advice 15 reps to everyone.the good thing is I've met some good trainers. They don't try to force their methods on everyone. I lucked out way back in the day and ended up with a high level powerlifter as a trainer. He was into heavy lifts, low reps and a LOT of rest in between sets. 

I lucked out in joining the gym. It was cheap, great equipment, empty most of the time so the trainer had nothing else to do but chat with me and give fitness tips. Wow, a lot going on here. I have been trying to get fit and get regular at a gym but I don't know what should I do. I am not experienced with the equipment and gym instructors only help out in the initial few days of joining a gym. Any ideas where I can learn the movements and how to do them safely, I'd like to avoid injury at all costs.  I have tried watching tutorials on youtube but it there is too much noise there to make senseful plan. Gymming veterans please help guide me. > BONUS: ""Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

This one is correct advice, but you don't need to do this for lower weights. As you stack more weights, the chance of slipping goes up. Also, when you lift the plates can spin a little because both your wrists are facing the same direction. The momentum can be enough to cause the barbell to spin out from your hand. 

TBH, i've seen lot of bro-sciency stuff even in the west. Trainers who keep updating their knowledge are the best ones. Ones who haven't will tell you it's ok to do lat pull downs behind your neck like they used to 20 years ago. Anytime fitness here pays general trainers like 10k for 8 hours shifts. A good occasionally competing trainer eats 30-40k  a month.  Senior trainers are also some 3-6 months certified ones with 2-3 years of lifting experience.

&#x200B;

But this thing is fading with the ecoms and these new Indian youtubers like Jeet Salal, Gaurav Taneja, Mybollywood Body, Guru mann, Sangram Chougule, Sahil Khan etc. So these trainers nowadays are mainly just for spotting weights or running an illegal steroid cycle. What gyms have you heard these from? Supporter nhi phnega toh ""chhota"" ho jayega "" paani bhar jayega"" I have learned the proper forms, techniques and workouts from YouTube. Yup they are. They also practice the worst bro science and will just take juice to get their body. 

If you wanna join a fitness and health discord server to discuss gym, supplements, diet share your progress etc.. 

https://discord.gg/uCgERhW [deleted] Ur right. Thats the case with 90 percent of the trainers. These guys are filled with bro science and have at some point in their life and/or currently taken steroids, to get their body where it is now. 

These idiots also peddle steroids / growth hormones / growth hormone releasing peptides to young naive gym goers to help reach the ideal 'instagrammable' physique. 


Off late these dumb fuck trainers have discovered muscle building content on youtube via fake natties and sellouts, further fuelled with social media and popular forums and are again peddling misinformation and bad plans to people.  There seems to be no end to this chutiyapa. 

People need to have thier eyes opened to the right information. Yes [deleted] [deleted] Darebee.com for routines and freeweight exercises This is very true One guy who used to train in our gym for a few years off and on has now become a trainer for a reputed gym brand (I won't say the name as I don't want him to get in trouble). Apart from the fact that he weighs barely more than a feather, we know that he doesn't know a thing about exercises, let alone nutrition and stuff. So, yeah, that's bound to happen. Also, most of them force you to increase the weight, without asking you to do so progressively, infact they don't even care about form, which is really important Ratio of gym patrons with fit bodies to unfit bodies is surprisingly high at my gym. I'd think the trainers do a good job here. Why would you call yourself a bad trainer? I started training in 2014 and have been training for the better part of last 5 years in Hyderabad. I have been to multiple gyms from cheap to the expensive ones(Core fitness). In my experience most of the gym trainers that i have met and conversed with don't know anything about training and bodybuilding. Most of trainers that i have encountered are just a bunch of guys who trained for a few years using PED's and steroids being completely clueless about basics of training, supplementation and  nutrition. Infact, most of them are just there to sell you products like protein powders, BCAA's, Creatine and that too fake ones. Even most of the youtubers present in Indian bodybuilding community like Rohit Khatri, Tarun Gill etc do not provide science based empirical studies and evidence behind their exercises and videos and is just bro science. I personally find youtubers like Seth Feroce([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkZuCxXdE6OUGDEbETcjhPw)) and  Jeff Nipard([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/icecream4PRs))  the best in the industry when it comes to sharing knowledge relating to supplements, exercises, importance of warmups, gear amongst other things. I have learnt the most from their youtube channels amongst all the youtubers that i used to follow.

It's good to see educated gym goers like you guys who actually give a shit about things like form, compound movements,proper warmup etc. I hope I can meet some of you in real life someday and share the love for working out. A beginner 17M here with 95Kg weight. Anybody can help suggest me something? Guys , I agree with mostly all of you. But koi mujhe yeh batao ki original supplements aur Sahi rates Mai kaha milenge? Flipkart aur Amazon pe Mai chutiya katwa chuka hu. On a completely different note, have you tried training with kettlebells? The stuff will turn you into a beast. I'm never going back to isolation workouts. You're not alone with this kind of experience This is an example of a job that can pay better in India than outside of India. 

I knew an American who made excellent money gym training in Mumbai, better than he would have back in the US. Tl;Dr version of my answer is yes. My trainer is completely aversive to suggest supplements but gives some bs advices at times. The most ridiculous being his diet charts. Follow the r/fitness wiki and the website exrx.net As someone who is deciding to make a career in fitness (starting as personal trainer), Which institute do you guys suggest?  

So far I've heard of K11, ACE, ACSM, IFSI, Gold's. I've failed 12th std, so can't do ACE or ACSM, their sites say that 12th is required as qualification.  

Any certified trainers here, that can guide me? I once saw a guy doing bent over rows on smith machine. No shit Sherlock",2019-06-07 17:13:30

One of my roommates was a masters in financial engineering, he was on the loan. People take loans. They do part time jobs too (in Uni Cafeterias for instance). Some universities are really affordable - ASU, UFL and if you have a strong recommendation and good grades you usually end up with scholarships. Plus getting a TA/RA and internship in second year helps immensely. 

But to really study for free it’s best to go to a fully funded PHD position. 

But majority of the students come from well off families and get the initial help from parents.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets?,16,di5x69,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/di5x69/askindia_why_do_we_have_so_much_distrust_of/,16,"Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government.",ohdickens," I remember, in the early 90s, my cousin brother endeavored to start a toy manufacturing company. It took a year and half to get all the permissions regarding land usage and taxes.

When he finally got to the stage of producing toys, he was already in losses as the interest for the loan kept pilling up (He had taken loans for machinery, which lay idle for a year, as he could not get permissions for manufacturing). When he finally started, he had to price the toys higher to offset some of the increasing debt. 

But then, if you remember, extremely cheap Chinese toys flooded the market (post-liberalization) and he had to declare bankruptcy after 4 years and close the company.

All because of red tapism.

This relates to point 5 of yours. I believe it has to do more with the Indian capitalists rather than to do with capitalism as such. 

Indian capitalists such as Nirav Modi and Ramalinga Raju who had successful business empire yet resorted to illegal activities. Sure there are illegal activities everywhere such as Enron scandal. But Indian businesses are too profit oriented, they treat their customers like shit. Before the entry of MNC in India, many Indian businesses had no policy of return even if the goods were damaged, they would instead blame the customer and government made slogans such as buyers beware. I still remember in early 90s how one of the big conservative textile shop in my city had a no return policy, they refused to take back damaged good they had sold us, I went to the same shop this year, they had a 15 days return policy what a surprise. 

MNCs changed all this but still people had a sour experience in general with these Indian capitalists add to the fact the MNCs remind them about East India company from our history text books. 

When the Indian businesses change their shitty outlook, Indians would start trusting them. Wtf....you cited Ambani and Adani as having no competition. Are you real?

Let's take the, telecoms sector and new entrant JIO. JIO came in and destroyed all the competition by lowering price that made most telecom companies either merge or go bust. 

A good Telecom regulator would have in some way prevented predatory pricing allowing fair competition to all players in this sector. **Every news be like - Government is God** I think the second point relates to affordability. Do people have choice with the amount of money they have or how many people with that kind of money do we have? The problem is not that we are taught capitalism incorrectly, the problem is that we are not taught capitalism at all. We have been having bad leaders for a really long time now. Political parties have been playing with the emotions of the poor by spreading lies about 'the wealthy'. They also know that it is easier to win an election by giving freebies and loan waivers than actually giving a damn about long term policies. The distrust is because of bad leaders hiding their incompetency behind lies Indian society is a low trust society as it is. I don't know the historical and sociological processes that have turned it this way, but it is what it is. It's made worse at the street level by the neighbourhood shopkeeper who isn't exactly a model of honesty anywhere in India. Even bigger businesses aren't exactly ethical with their customers, are they? Probably, the deep distrust of businesses stems from these two factors. It's not entirely unwarranted. A poor justice system and the role of influence in law enforcement means it's better to start with distrust and be overcautious, rather than trust and lose money.

&#x200B;

At a government level, Nehru had the biggest influence in how governments look at businesses. As somebody who had seen the bad effects of colonial capitalist greed on our society, he was instinctively anti-capitalist. That attitude grew worse with Indira when highest levels of taxation on businessmen were imposed in the 70s and 80s. Naturally, they preferred to launder it to tax havens, and I think it is this image of tax-evading businesses that has been imprinted in the modern Indian bureaucrat's and citizen's mind. OMG dude, what have you done! You talked about...capitalism...here!? Oh god, prepare to be bashed and the downvotes.

Well jokes aside, the recent emergence of socialists in America and India are reactionary. Humans are shitheads and when they came to know this, since they can't blame humans, they are taking their anger out on the system - capitalism. Nice scapegoat. You have a problem with your relations? Capitalism. You have problem of diarrhea? Capitalism. The grocer charged you 2 rupees extra? Capitalism. The environment is degrading? Capitalism. As if Adam Smith wrote in his book to do all these.

The right wingers think ""government bad, corporates good"" while leftists think ""government good, corporates bad"". Both are right and wrong in their own way. Rightists understand that markets are important and that centrally planned economy and too much rules and regulations hurt the economy. And leftists are right in the sense that they understand that crony capitalism is harmful and that too many wrong risks can create depression/recession during which the government has to intervene (2008 global crisis). Currently, since right wing is on the rise, there is a reactionary socialist movement, that's all.",2019-10-15 18:25:30
AskIndia,[AskIndia] Help me deal with an asshole tenant,77,cq5tzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cq5tzw/askindia_help_me_deal_with_an_asshole_tenant/,27,"Background: I rented my house to friend's acquaintance after a referral; he was a decent working guy with two kids. Since I repainted the house a week before and he needed a house for just a year; I did not put clause to painting cost of the house in the agreement, how much damage you could make in an year right!?

Fast forward to one year: **The agreement ended in the Feb 2019**, he stayed in the house until end of the May 2019, **without paying rent for three months**

And his kids thrashed the house completely. There was crayons scribbles everywhere, mud everywhere, even adults drew rangoli on the wall!

Now: I told him, I will deduct unpaid rent, the cost of painting, and to fix broken things from the security deposit. The guy is acting like complete asshole, locking the front gate and not returning the keys to the house, until I repay the security deposit in full!

I am replacing the locks to the house, consult the lawyer.



What are my other options? I don't really care about the money at this point, all want is the guy to pay for the damages.

Edit: added missing details

Edit 2: here's few pictures https://imgur.com/a/H6BPXLC",prashantvc," Never let a tenant stay even a minute beyond the lease date. No matter how well you know the person. This puts you and your property at immense risk incase things turn sour.


Security deposit is kept exactly for these situations- damage to the property. Furthermore, the rent for the time he has been living should be adjusted from the security deposit. You need to involve a paper trail ASAP. 


Involve the police and send him a legal notice if need be. First priority should be to get him out of the house. Police should help out here. But vamilies don't trash rented places. Only vaachalars do.

Hope you have taken pictures of the damages. Discriminate against bachelors more. ""Decent guy with 2 kids"" lol I hope you're not in Bengal cause the West Bengal Tenency Act leaves you no room to manoeuvre . Best i suggest is either cut off electricity/water/supplies or go to the local thana. They'll make a call and that sorts out most issues. Or tell any police friends you might have to call and threaten them on your behalf. He doesn't really have any standing . Do not get dragged into court no matter what!!!

Good luck Not an expert on this, but just get a cop in there? [removed] I think the interest on the security deposit alone would be enough to make up for the lost rent :) He cannot legally lock you out. Lawyer up. 
Also ditch that friend who recommended this guy.",2019-08-14 14:30:06
AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Business owners of r/india, what is something you wish you knew before starting a business in India?",44,dfx045,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dfx045/askindia_business_owners_of_rindia_what_is/,9,"Considering starting a business myself and wanted to know what existing businessmen/women have to say.

Could be tips, warnings anything. I'm very eager to hear what you've got to say.",fbenmart," It would be good for you to mention what kind of business you are starting to advice can be more targeted towards your domain area. Anyway these few will help you get started:

1) Cash flow is everything. An accounting profit without cash flow is insignificant. Once your business is large enough you can even have banks deploy vendor/customer financing programs. There are startups who do this too now as well as receivables factoring exchanges (RXIL through TReDs) In India, it is not demand that creates cash, but rather cash that creates demand

2) Keep in mind in a lot of cases, the buyer is different from the user is different from the payer. Draw a people chart and plot what each persons motivations are and what you need to do to get the nod from each.

3) You are not your customer. Don't assume you know anything about your customer. This is why feedback loops are so important - they deliver both implicit and explicit feedback about the customer and how you should iterate your product and business. Invest heavily in feedback loops and make sure you're drawing intelligent insight from them. 

4) Don't be afraid of giant players. Big players are slow, have limited flexibility and capacity for change, have fixed cost structures and business models and do in fact leave plenty of room on the table for smaller players to operate. 

5) Contrary to what you may think, the best product does not always win. Marketing, branding, and sales is crucial. Don't ignore this just because you have an amazing product. Carefully monitor your sales and marketing funnel. Credit is everything. Treat money like raw material to build your empire. Whenever possible take loans. If you have surplus cash, buy real estate with it, rent that out and then take loan on that real estate and do business Businesses die less because of shitty products and more because of cash flow issues

Cash in hand >>> 10x unpaid invoices Avoid doing B2C  businesses in India and even if you do try to do something where stakes are not high <₹1000 per customer revenue types - coz non-payment or delayed payment won't threaten your business's existence. Try to be on the right side of legal stuff and tax authorities. Also, try to build relationships with everyone around as a lot of business in India happens through word of mouth. Best business would be to outsource IT or other services in this economic climate. B2C  really drains you, especially if you're marketing it yourself . For example we make Aluminum ladders , both industrial and domestic, and I've had people fight me because apparently they think it's made of tin, I personally don't have the patience for retail  . I like handling B2C, not that it is not challenging either, large corporations , most of them want your products for a credit or 30 days minium and you need o chase them for months for payments. 
My father set up the business  20 years ago. Being an OEM is very challenging because you need to manage alot of fronts, trading would probably have its own set of problems too. get your invoices cleared as soon as possible, as someone else said ""cash in hand (realistically in bank!)"" is king. 

Try to build a safety net of readily available cash (min. 3 months, max. 12 months of operational cash) 

control your spending in the good times that way you will be ready for the inevitable bad times. 

Be ready to pay bribes for the weirdest of issues (e.g. in mumbai, we got harassed by the local municipal officials for not having the sufficient number of fans in the office!). 

Needless to say ""Build Connections"" in your industry, try to have some local ""influential´s"" in your circle, inviting them for free booze and food usually does the trick, 

attend your industries conferences as much as possible, most connections will be built there.

Have a good CA and lawyer on call

expect the unexpected, such weird things happen, you simply cannot plan it (e.g. a bridge fell down near our office and caused mayhem for the employeees who were travelling from that location to the office, what a mess that day was), i think that is the biggest problem in India, so much unexpected things happen, you need deep pockets and the mental fortitude to survive it, riots, floods, terrorist attacks, demonetisation, some local corporator asking for bribes etc. etc. some entirely random thing that sometimes its impossible to recover from.

I will stop now, could go on and on but you  get the idea, anyway best of luck and i hope you  see the wildest success possible.

I for one could not take on all this ... entropy and emigrated in the end.... life is much more stable now. Played too much Civ5. Thought Modi is going to start Golden Era in India. Never been so wrong ! To each his own. Good luck brother Any saas entrepreneur wanna share some tips ?",2019-10-10 20:03:25

There are all kinds of sales going on the cheap guitars. My question is which brand, preferably cheap, would be good for a beginner like me.   
TIA :)",amaanrizwan," if you have a 5k budget, I'd look for a second  hand guitar, it is very hard to find a first hand quality guitar at that price.

 A lot of people buy fancy guitars planning to become the next guitar god, practice 3 weeks and quit.  so there are often many bargains available second hand.

that said you need to find someone experienced to  make sure your purchase is not flawed. Go to Facebook groups - AM Used Musical Instruments & Gear or MM Used Musical Instruments and check out the listings there. Some great deals come there from time to time and it’s a well-moderated group with mostly trustworthy people.

Second hand is the way to go on your budget. Common misconception is that acoustics are meant to be cheap and electrics are meant to be expensive but a cheap acoustic plays like shit and sounds like shit so definitely stay away from brands like Juarez, Intern etc that you see on amazon. They will kill your enthusiasm in weeks, even though the deals might seem like a steal.

For 5000, I’d look for a Yamaha F310 or FS100C (quite common on the used market and really solid beginner and intermediate guitars). Yamaha makes great instruments at all prices. Also definitely spend a little more and get a setup from a guitar shop along with fresh new strings (even better if the seller does it for you). It’ll go a long way in improving your experience. Good luck! Acoustic guitars can be Steel strings or nylon strings. Steel strings are the toughest to play, nylon strings are the easiest. But the styles are also somewhat different. Finger picking for nylon strings and plectrum for Steel. 

 Granada, Yamaha, are the better companies but good models from Pluto, etc. should do. ₹5000 is the lowest price you will find them, so go second hand from olx etc. 

Get a guitar app with tuner like smart chord and check every note of the guitar before buying. Good luck. Hey, getting a decent guitar for 5k is a bit difficult. I'd recommend stretching your budget by 2-3k and buy a Pluto electric-acoustic guitar. It's a great guitar for beginners and it was my first guitar when I started.

If you can't go beyond 5k, look for a second hand guitar. Check out Pluto Brand Acoustic Guitar.  I remember buying new one for around Rs 6500 including the bag.  I bought from B&M store. I second Yamaha F310 as pointed out by another user but I think it goes around 6k. For a beginner, brand as much doesn't matter, but please make sure you buy a jumbo guitar which are costlier than their regular counterparts but very worth the investment. Jumbo guitars have that additional bass sound which  gives a depth to their overall music and makes it  stand apart from normal ones.

Krafter is a very common brand which gives okayish guitars in low ranges, Givson is another. But if it's your first guitar don't buy it on a sale or online. Always buy after listening to the sound. There are slight variations even in the same model.",2019-10-03 10:59:13

Cons (probable): not the same standard of living as is currently?, slower professional growth, racism?

Some Cons that aren't always shared:
Expect a much quieter social life, a cultural gap in addition to a generational gap with your children, a reduced sense of self-identity, a lower standard of living and immense adjustment stress. 

Ofcourse you'll have more money after immigrating but it won't feel as luxurious as it sounds when one multiples dollars into rupees. If you enjoy a more self-involved lifestyle, it'll be easier to adjust. If you'd like, I'd be happy to chat over dm and answer more specific questions.

With just two months of salary in Canada you can actually afford a nice 60 inch LED TV, a sound bar and a nice couch. One year into job you can afford a muscle car like Camaro or Mustang (with loan ofcourse). You can also meet Indians and make new Indian friends by going to temples or other Indian group meeting that you look up on Facebook. 

But if you are a kind of guy who likes to be around family and friends, don't really care what car you are driving and the kind of house you are staying in then Canada might be boring. All in all I would say getting Luxury is easier in Canada/Australia than in India. But getting Family and friends is easier in India. And as someone already mentioned if you have Kids then the equation is entirely different. I migrated to Canada in 2017 - it's been a great experience for me so far, but it boils down to effort, luck and circumstances. 

My standard of life by local comparisons is definitely lower than my peers - a dollar goes a lot less than a rupee would in India. Having said that, though - I've never been a particularly money obsessed person. Give me a cot, 3 square meals and a roof over my head and I'm good, but I do appreciate that the quality of stuff I get here is substantially better for the amount I pay for it compared to India. 

Professional growth - I'd argue it's the opposite due to my specific circumstances. Employers let you Work from Home, some others (like mine) have an 'education allowance' to allow you to upskill on the company's dime, I get plenty of days off (5 day work week, statutory holidays means no work - it's actually straight up criminal and I get Christmas week (till New Year's off). Nobody questions/interrogates you if you want to take a few days off. I actually changed my role within the company because my own manager said I'd be a right fit for it and he helped me get the job. I love my coworkers and we get along very well. 

Racism - Can't speak for Australia but in Canada, it's mostly been low-key and barely noticeable if not non-existent (largely owing to the significant number of Indians already in Canada), outside of some clearly mentally ill people (the city of Toronto does a shitty job of looking after the mentally ill homeless people, especially now that it's summer and they're all around the city). 

I've already accepted the fact that neither side will truly accept me for what I am (Third Culture Kid, so not really fully Indian and not really super westernized, either) so the idea of a generational gap is already a forgone conclusion. 

Happy to answer any questions if folks are interested in learning more about the process or are generally just weighing options and want to know more about life in Canada - I also happen to run a landing group for new immigrants basically to help them with a social support structure as they get their sea legs after they land. It could be. 

You need to identify what pay in Canada/Australia is equivalent to the 1.6 lpm.  Then identify jobs that pay that in respective countries and then identify cities that would make your chances of achieving that better. 

For factors such as free/subsidized medical, education and to some extent a higher standard of living (to each his own). It is definitely worth doing it. 

Happy to answer in private too. Especially about Australia. Or even New Zealand. So this might be a one off case but even younger Indian who are in their 20s or 30s can experience a massive culture shock.

Eg 1 : My friend and his two kids stayed in Boston. So Indians are known as a race who hits their kid to discipline them (also  known as child abuse ). So his kid's friends and teachers had taught the kid that they can call the police if their parents hit them. 

His kids were the worst pieces of unruly shit I have ever laid my eyes upon. He and his wife literally went mad trying to discipline them. The kids used to threaten to call the police or complain to teacher if they hit them. So the parents were quite shocked and unable to control their kids. They eventually moved back to India.

Eg 2: if you are a conservative Indian, be prepared for your kids teenage years. They will date other people, probably indulge in casual sex, have secret alcohol parties. Dress skimpily and post tons of those pics on fb, Instagram etc. This is just pretty much inevitable and pretty common in the west. 

I have a modern friend who is well travelled, well read, rich and comfortable but just can't sleep because his teenage daughter was dating someone and loved partying and dancing. They can compromise on many things but kid's possible promiscuity is something they can't adjust to. 

This was few observations from a a decade ago or so. Depends on your line of work too, I guess. A 1.6 LPM friend of mine moved to Canada for MBA (he was in IT here before that) and struggled to find a job in business/management. So switched to IT after doing his MBA since he saw better job prospects here. Within Canada there are a lot of variations as well. Vancouver and Toronto metro areas are expensive and you will definitely have to sacrifice on some of your comforts. Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Winnipeg and Halifax are far more affordable. Halifax is a booming city now with a growing tech industry and pretty affordable. Canada isn’t as high paying as the US. But it’s offset by free healthcare, education & the environment there. It’s a massive pain to adjust to any new country. 

Even if you find a job that pays 100k CAD a year, the adjustments you need to make in terms of social settings will stay the same. 

But, depending on where in Canada you are for example GTA - you’ll find a robust Indian community. Canadians are in general more welcoming of immigrants vs other countries in the current scenario. 

Australia is just way too racist for my personal taste. They’ve a very rigid set of thinking & have an intellectual superiority complex in the work place & there is a Trump like PM in Australia now. Absolutely. I was a 1.6lpm before leaving. This was 2 years ago. It was totally worth it. I'd do it knowing what I know now. [deleted] [deleted] Yes, it is. Any day a good option...Unless your 5.1 lpm get the fuck out while you can.",2019-06-24 13:11:18

Eggs

Soya balls

Oats

Bajra roti 

Ground nuts 

Lentils

Methi 

Palak 

Loki 

Cucumber 

Bitter gourd

Banana 

Watermelon 
 

All in moderation is healthy The brits have a saying about 5 a day, which is 5 fruit and veg in a day. I try to keep that up with cheap ingredients.

Lentils are cheap and a good source of fibre and protein. So dal with rice, then whatever cheap seasonal veggies I can get my hands on. Bottle gourd, spinach, cauliflour etc. I make a batch of poriyal with each one, then mix and match for a week. Different lentils so I don't feel like I'm having the same thing over and over.

Idli with sambar is cheap too. 

Eggs, in different ways. Like in fried rice with some veggues left after making a big batch of poriyal. Or egg curry with idli.

When buying chicken, I buy the whole thing. I use the legs for curry, breasts for something like chicken 65, leftover meat for salad. The bones make a good stock, which can be used with the eggs and leftover meat for Chinese sweet corn chicken soup.

The trick is to learn how to use every ingredient in many things, as well as how to repurpose leftovers in a different tasting dish. I used these dishes when I was in India, and now that I live in a very expensive country, I use them even more. I just replace Indian veggies with the local cheap ones like broccoli and zucchini. Sattu ka sherbet Oats for breakfast- there's deal on Amazon every two weeks or from dmart add few Slices fruits and milk. Eggs, peanuts, spinach. Chicken.

Edit: soy beans basic food stuff is already pretty cheap in india, not sure how much cheaper you can get. Daal, roti, eggs, in season veggies and fruits, chicken breast(debatable if it's cheap but from a protein/cost ratio it's one of the better deals out there), dahi etc. Basically Ghar ka khaana but with a little more emphasis on protein and veggies rather than the carbs and snacking on fruits, dahi, nuts(expensive yes but alternatives like pumpkin seeds etc exist). We're lucky we get fresh food at a very reasonable rate and we have the eat cheap and healthy sorted out for us Idli **If you cooking at home:**

* Boiled Eggs 5 INR Each 7P6F
* Chicken 30 Rs per meal 50P10F
* Paneer 45 Per meal 30P40F
* Chhole/Rajma/Soya/Peanuts/Other Lentils= \~100 INR per Kg
* Ghee 400/KG
* Rice and Potato/Sweet Potato/Banana for carbs.
* Cucumbers, Spinach, Carrot,  Cauliflower, Cabbage, Tomato, Onion for basic Salad and unlimited seasonal veggies.

**Healthy, Cheaper, Transparent and Cleaner options i prefer when eating out:**

* Chicken/Paneer Tandoori/Tikka 100-200 INR for 300-400g
* Rajma/Chole Chawal
* Chicken/Mutton Biryanis
* Plain Milk, Curd. Oatmeal is relatively cheap here, easy to make and eat. Wheat roti and Gujrati dal. It's light and really filling. Eggs, rajma chili, roasted sweet potato , brown rice pulao , sprouts salad, sauted green veggies, nuts, upma, etc. Its not difficult once you learn what produce you can actually use, it just comes down to trial and error for what works for you. We Indians tend to consume a lot of carbohydrates and fats and minimal proteins. Those who advocate lentil based diets tend to miss the point that the quality of the proteins isn't comparable to animal based proteins. Another important point is the fact that diets high on lentils and fiber have less protein available for absorption though calculated values may far exceed the reality at the level of the small intestine. A diet based on animal protein is your best bet for good growth. Plant based proteins that can replace animal protein based diets are still expensive and not widely available. Oats with almonds Dal, sabzi, salad, roti/rice. Everything prepared in home Rice/Roti, daal and papad. Extremely easy to cook, cheap af. Sometimes add eggs to the meal. Dahi vada! High in fibre and protein, and delicious as well. [deleted]",2019-06-22 13:55:48

Syngonium, Agloanema, Spider Plant are difficult to kill if kept in a bright part of the room away from direct sunlight but need regular watering. 

Varieties of Philodendron, money plant can be window plants with limited direct sunlight and cuttings can be kept alive in water. Jade plant can also be an option for a window plant.

And the first thing she said was this.... https://i.imgur.com/YYJ1rMR.jpg 😂              

Porn ban did affect her in the past, but not anymore. I had the pavlovian reaction of getting a erection whenever I looked at the VPN app on the homepage so I had to remove it. I’ve always used torrent to download premium porn i.e Brazzers, NA, BangBros, etc etc 

So i don’t care. 

Never was a fan of tube porn. Yes. It helps my r/NoFap journey. Most of the comments didn't mention Torr browser which I feel is much easier and free.

Is there any con with the browser? No way like i advised last time someone posted a huge thread , opera browser has free VPN. Use that browser and enjoy your porn without any restriction. The locations are Us eu sea regions. At home , i have a local ISP so nothing's banned but on Airtel I use opera browser, the speeds are okayish and it's convenient. All the porn ban has done is made me use a VPN. I use my imagination more. Haven't affected me much cause I haven't been watching it often the last couple of years. I'm just over thirty and have watched it somewhat at least once a month since I was 13. I've always been religious though. So I've always tried not to do it. Did NoFap for some years and something clicked two years ago. I mean I still end up watching porn once every three or four months but it's not terribly exciting. It has to be said, it's super annoying when I watch it but don't get a big hit of dopamine like did when I was a teen. In the end I'm like, 'All this sinning for *this*?' lol. So yeah, I haven't felt the impact of the ban. There were a few times I tried to access the sites and saw that it was banned. I just shrugged and moved on.

1. Will my Indian driving license be enough or would I have to get an International Driver's Permit?
2. If yes, would I have to get my DL translated to Italian?
3. Any other tips on driving in Italy (major differences between Indian roads and Italian ones, etc.)

Thanks in advance for all your help!",straysandcurrant," First read the road code of Italy , go through some basic driving tests on their road transport authority website to check how goo are you at road code. 

IDP to Italian not needed. English one will work just fine. It's confusing as fuck while driving on the retarded side of the road , be cautious. My wife and I got married in Italy just this past November and we rented cars and drove all over. 

A few points. 

1. I had an American DL and an international permit but she only had her Aussie license. Technically, you need an IDP to drive but the rental car agency didn't care. 

2. If we had been pulled over, she'd have been in trouble. According to Italian law, you need an IDP. 

3. Please watch out for ZTL. It's a goddamn nightmare. Download a ZTL app to help you navigate. 

4. Do you really need to drive? Italy has great trains. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't drive in Italy. I've driven pretty much everywhere. Driving in Italy was worse than driving in India, particularly Naples and the Amalfi coast. IDK much but, Italians drive on the right side of the road, just like Americans & have steering wheel on the left. LOL",2019-09-29 01:43:52

Not to be immodest or self gratuitous but its kinda weird that people stare at you in envy or maybe thats just me. Ok so not great looking and stuff, but I did become significantly better looking after losing weight. I'm told I'm ""cute"". It was a world of a difference with regards to my confidence and peoples perspective of me.

People treat me nicer when I'm thinner. I've been on dates with some very pretty girls and all round excellent human beings with interesting backgrounds (models, actresses, chefs, entrepreneurs etc.) Being more attractive than my past self has gotten me more attention and positive interest for the most part. People are also less harsh with their first impression of you. I'm not that good looking that people envy me, so yeah there's that. My friend is great looking.

So he gets a lot of female attention in general ( nature , you know )

He was in 2 or 3 platonic relationship ( wow ) 

Lots of crushes

Gets his work done ( from his admirers of course )

But still he is down to earth and humble. People just stare continuously, it's very very annoying, but I just learnt to ignore and pretend as if nothing's happening.

I feel bad for girls, They have it much much worse. Physical looks of a man don't matter much if it's not matched by confidence and certain badness. It's a mixed bag, you get better treatment from women in general and you end up having a few crazy girls with crushes on you etc. And some guys will absolutely hate you because you will make them feel insecure about their looks.

Water and environment might have some passing effect, but if it's in your genes, consider yourself fucked out of a full lush head of hair. 

Makes me cry everytime. Bangalore can make you go bald due to the ground water that some parts of the city uses. Check for water quality. Hard water does that. Check water quality. Hard water can make your hair brittle There are so many reasons for balding:

Genetic

Hormonal

Hard water

Autoimmune 

Last but the best, EVOLUTION (You don't need them to survive so if you're balding and all the other causes are ruled out then consider yourself to be on the forefront of evolution). It's an advantage. Avoid stress, keep your scalp always clean- no dandruff and shit. This worked for me. [removed] Genetics are the main reason for early balding. Your maternal grandfather's hair is a generally a good indicator for your hair health. If he faced balding problems early in his life, there is a good chance of you facing them too.
Stress, diet, haircare and exercise definitely help but if your genetics are the cause of your balding, you're going to face a tough time dealing with it. 
Consult a trichologist who'll give you better insights about it. All I can say mate is go buzz. It's due to genes. But still there may be chances that it's temporary. So don't stress, no gel, no wax and go buzz. See the result overtime. And more advice is stop \*cough\*... \*cough\* fapping for sometime(may not be necessary).",2019-07-07 23:13:53

Tech companies: Nahi dungi [deleted] If you think you've the skillset, follow HackerEarth events closely. They've hiring challenges every month and most of the jobs pay upwards of 6.5-7lpa, provided you are a mid-to-high level coder.

If you're a rookie in programming or don't know programming at all or don't have exposure to at least one framework (i.e. if I ask you to do XYZ, you should be somehow able to do it), then aiming for 8lpa is really not right. Become a female Have you got that 8LPA, or still searching? BTW, I am in the same boat as you are, searching for a better package than Service based company. Get a job in a start-up, whatever the salary. Build your profile for 2 to 3 years and then jump. You'll easily get around 15 lpa. Beta, forget all that..Join the army and serve the nation. Jai Hind!

Cant hear everybodys shit now A kindle . 

I didn't buy books cuz they were costly . Just invested in a kindle and read a lot of books . 

An Audible Subscription ( Audio books).  
When I got to working I had an hour long commute on either side , instead of just listening to the same old songs , I got a trial subscription and abused the fuck out of it.  I got myself a hard medical mattress. Man, it improved my sleeping so much. Never realised that my previous spinal pain episodes were induced by the soft and springy mattress.

Best purchase decision in the last 5 years, honestly. Good knife for the kitchen, and a 'combination stone' to keep the knife sharp. A multimeter.

There's only one 'combination stone' available in the market, and that is [this](https://www.amazon.in/Cumi-CSSC109-Combination-Silicone-Carborundum/dp/B00S86FA6M/) available online at \~Rs. 240 and offline(at least here in Sec'bad) at \~Rs. 135/-

[This](https://www.amazon.in/Mastech-MAS830L-Digital-Pocket-Multimeter/dp/B0093H048Y) (which cost me \~Rs. 400/-) is what I upgraded from. Air purifier. I live in Delhi Caterpillar trekking shoes when they were available in market about a decade back. Shit still has enough life for another 10 years Noise cancellation headphones (Bose QC 30) for flights. I take at least 2 flights a week and I can sleep on morning flights because of it. 



 Cordless vacuum cleaner. Cleaning house is so much easier, and now house gets cleaned more often. I was putting off buying a microwave for years. It has been life changing since I got it. I get to eat hot food again like it was just prepared. People on the edge, just go ahead and buy it. It's totally worth it.  I bought (almost jokingly) one of those make-up brushes for women to clean my laptop. Lo and behold I clean each and every gadget (and other precious items) with it nowadays. 
Link for those interested: https://www.amazon.in/Vega-Wooden-Handle-Natural-Synthetic/dp/B00791F224/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1542636877&sr=8-5&keywords=vega+makeup+brushes A basic cycle from decathlon. Use this frequently now instead of car for short distances. Got a UPS 5yrs ago... almost forgotten abt power cuts  SSD for my laptop. It is noticeably faster now. An electric shaver/trimmer by Philips. Got it for like 700 something during some promotion. Used to have a lot of skin problems that now I know to be due to my earlier means of shaving (razor/cartridge style blades). Sure, they don't give a close shave but it is good enough and does not cause a lot of skin problems that may happen when you use a blade of any kind on skin. I listen to a lot of podcasts and relaxation/lounge music. But using earphones for longer periods is inconvenient. So I bought a JBL Flip 3 during the sale and I just let it play on my disk while I work. It has a 12 hr battery on 50% volume pleasant to hear. The LG gram laptop for 70k. Batter is soooooooo long. Always lasts full day. And it's only around 900 something gram.

I can now code all day without breaking my back.  A Chromecast, honestly. Don't know why anyone would go for a smart TV anymore. Offers very little functionality over the relatively cheap device.  I collected money for 1year and brought adidas shoes. And it was my best purchase. After that i realised shoes are most important to feel comfortable. I bought a hydroflask 720 ml insulated bottle. 

Cold water all the time!

It was a little expensive but its also got a lifetime warranty theres that.  In Delhi, you get these electric charge hot water bags. Cost 200-250 Rs. Very comfortable in winters. Not one, but almost any high quality item I have purchased has served me really, really well. In contrast, whenever I've saved money on things, they ended up either requiring a lot of repairs or downright upgrading quicker than I thought. Here are a few top picks:

1. Memory foam mattress (significantly improves sleep)
2. High end running shoes from Decathlon (reduce strain on your ankles, don't skimp on shoes!)
3. A 27"" 4K monitor (Man, this thing is amazing to watch movies and youtube on, as well as general browsing and coding. If you are using a laptop, seriously consider attaching it to a monitor and getting wireless keyboard and mouse)
4. A gearless scooter in Bangalore: Here, public transport is non-existent, Uber is too slow/expensive and auto guys fleece you hard. Scooter will easily run you down 8000-10000 km a year and if you think of 20 rupees per km for Uber(standard in Bangalore), it justifies the cost of scooter + fuel in less than a year. Also, gearless is much easier to drive in city traffic.

&#x200B;

In contrast, the cheap chair I bought gives me back pains after long sessions(trying to get rid of it at a loss :( ), the 8 years old second hand fridge required several repairs, and the cheap laptop I bought gave me heating issues and horrible battery life. I have learned my lesson that good stuff lasts longer and pays for itself in that time. Amazon Alexa along with a few connected lights. Very convenient to have it all synced up. Also, if you cook a fair bit or just enjoy cooking, get a good quality knife or 2. Makes cooking so much nicer. [A monitor stand from Amazon basics](https://imgur.com/gallery/xYmihOM) Bought some TheraBands, now  exercise at home. I am way more regular at working out.  A house A laptop cooling pad. Do not worry about laptop heating now. * Water Filter - No more need to buy water Cans 
* Cartini Serated knife 
* Car air pump 
 Chromecast is great. Purchasing dashcam also makes me feel safe while driving. Chromecast... really dont wanna see anything in a small phone screen now.  A good quality mattress with pillow that suits your body.

No amount of exercise and yoga can help your body if your mattress and pillow are not comfortable(doesn't always need to be soft). You spend most of your life of bed(average 6+ hours) so compromising with it is not a good idea.

I fall asleep fast, have less back and neck pain and cramps even after long duration of sleep thanks to one good investment I made. Raspberry Pi (mini computer board). Installed Kodi.

&#x200B; Harman Kardon Soundsticks II  


I got them almost 7 years ago during some sale on Flipkart, I think. Picked 'em up for about Rs 7,000. They are by far the most exquisite sounding home-speakers I've owned.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] I found out that my wife is cheating. Advice on next steps!,217,awhwhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/awhwhv/askindia_i_found_out_that_my_wife_is_cheating/,125,"Hello /r/india I don't visit this frequently and rarely posted or commented here. I run a small engineering firm and make more then enough to live a happy, comfortable and also few luxuries. Worked very hard to be where I am.

So I found out that my wife is cheating. I am 39 and she is 33 and we have two kids, a girl and a boy. I am very upset. The marriage is broken irreparably. I want out.

I have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over. The wait of next two days sees unbearably long. 

Knowing my wife, I know it's going to be a big drama which I want to avoid at all costs. I just want to put evidence of her activities before her and part our ways silently. What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? I will also hire a PI the first thing the next week.

I'd like to have full custody of our children. Does anyone know under what conditions will I be able to get that?

EDIT:

Thanks for all your responses. Few were helpful, few disturbing and few others distasteful. Anyway, I am just normal at home as if nothing happened. I have a strictly predictably routine and I intend to keep it that way. I am off to drop my daughter at her friend's place who is celebrating her birthday today.

I am very methodical and I'll deal with this issue just like that. I am going to write down everything I plan to do, rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer (he responded), plug holes and build a solid case.

There are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it. What's important to me primarily is the evidence, the truth and the full picture. What I do with it is totally a different matter altogether. I may not tell her, I may just poke and see the response, I may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings (and that's up to lawyer anyway) or I may just burn it all. The world doesn't need to know I employed an investigator to collect evidence, legal or not.",ThisSuggestedName," [deleted] Hey, I am fighting a domestic violence case filed against me by my wife. There are a few things I want to share.            

First things first. Custody mostly goes to mothers and the fathers get visitation rights on weekends, festivals etc. The legal system in India is highly biased in favor of women. Not to discourage you, but adultery in India is very difficult to prove. In one case, a man produced pictures of his wife in compromised positions with another man, and in turn his wife filed a new case of outraging her modesty. It is not impossible, but difficult.       
      
Now, main issue: money. Everything will come down to money. How much are you willing to give to her so that she says yes for a divorce. They call it settlement, which in easy words is extortion. Everybody in the system, right from clerk to judge will ask you to settle. Lumpsum money or else monthly maintenance for her. If you file a divorce, chances are you will get a 498A, DV, 125 package in return.      
      
This are some of the problems, now some solutions. Main: gather all the evidences that you can, each & everything, document everything and she shouldn't know about it. Gather her job records & salary slips (if she is working) and education records (if she isn't working). List down all your assets and liabilities. Document stuff that shows she has been a careless mother.      
      
If you are able to prove adultery beyond a reasonable doubt, you have cracked it. SC said that a wife committing adultery is not entitled to get any maintenance or other monetary benefits.        
      
Most importantly, keep a cool head. Don't lose heart. Happens with many of us and you are not the only one who is wronged. Be motivated and never lose your focus on your job/work. Your value is just because of your job/work.  Document everything. Meticulously. Chat msgs from years back, your paper documents, the money you both spent, everything. As detailed as you can. You never know what can come useful. Don't confront until you have solid evidence.

Custody is something that usually isn't affected by adultery. As in you aren't going to get full custody simply because of the fact that your wife cheated. Economics and stable environment are the key factors there.

The simplest way to get access to FB or phone lock is to stand behind the person when they're unlocking and sneak a look. Then ask to make a call or something and use it. There's no magic hacking apps or something like that so try not to download a virus in the enthusiasm.

Stay calm, go take a walk or a long shower. As in chess, when you're position is disadvantaged, it's time to slow down, consolidate your position and think about the next move carefully. Not throw the game in anger. Good luck and keep us posted OP. [removed] I’d recommend you in any emergency case of a 498A/125DV, connect to Shonee Kapoor. This guy literally nailed his own case with a victory (Adultery and post that False 498A. Court had quashed his case and he didn’t have to give any kind of maintenance)

Hope you are fine brother. Please collect as much evidence as you can. Phone call recordings, pictures, chats, SMSes, every goddamn thing you have against her.

Very high probability that the opposition lawyer will suggest your wife to file all those 498A 125DV bullshit charges for sure so that they could harass you more.

Hell, these things literally deter me from getting married in the future. [removed] women tend to have an upper hand in these situations my question is the person married or not? Sorry to hear that buddy. I can only wish you good luck... and offer you a beer. Keep your chin up. Take a paternity test. Sincerely Dude consult a family lawyer he would be able to give you far better advice than any user out here. Marriage and divorce are huge thing in India so there is no escaping the family drama. Lesson learnt. Never gonna get married
 First up, remove the personal details you have supplied in the first post. Can easily be passed on to your spouse if somebody connected + adept at reddit goes through it. 1) Adultery is grounds for divorce.

2) Regarding custody. It is generally true that it is awarded to the mother. However, in this case her behaviour would be a strong consideration to award it to you.

Disclaimer: nothing in this comment should be construed as legal advice. Please contact a lawyer. From now on you may want to screenshot all chats with her and also record phone conversations.  > What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? 

Do not go down this path. You'll come out worse off than before.  How did you find out ?  Is the evidence fool proof?

Who is the guy she is cheating with? Hey, I'm a little late to the thread, but I thought I'd chime in, a bit, being a lawyer. 

You're being remarkably level-headed about this, which  is a huge plus. that being said, I understand your motivation to gather evidence, but make sure you do nothing illegal. You don't want to have a criminal case against you, and, as others have said, our judicial system is quite biased towards women. A competent lawyer could easily allege stalking, outraging the modesty of a woman, indecency, etc. 

Another thing is to make sure you go to the right lawyer. You mentioned you're going to the best lawyer in the city. Make sure he/she also practices in the district courts, where your case will be filed. The best lawyers usually tend to practice in High Courts and the Supreme Court, and lose touch with trial court practice. 

If you have anything you need to ask, feel free to message me. I hope everything works out for you. Hit the lawyer, Delete Gym, Facebook Up. If you have multiple devices lying around like an extra tablet, iPad and by any chance if she's logged into FB on those device/s you could use that to read her FB chat logs and take screenshots. 
Don't confront her without evidence plan with your lawyer. 
I have no experience but I have read and seen movies and I'm speaking from those stories.  Pretty sure you are taking the right decision. Get off that cheating piece of shit. erm, pretty sure it's illegal to monitor her email/phone Look dude i don't have any idea about this stuff but most of the people here are saying to gather enough evidence so i will suggest try to hire a private investigator who will help you with that stuff, also contact your lawyer about this. If you don't have any evidence, then play it cool. Or else, she will figure out something is up, and guess you know. In which case, she might file fake domestic violence charges against you to make your future claims look unreliable. Also, I would recommend you delete this post too. Just in case she or her lover frequents this sub. firstly freeze your bank accounts and other valuables so that wife does not have access...then collect as many evidences as possible video and audio recordings work best..after all this confront your wife and ask your divorce..tell her that you have strong evidences if she resists Hey OP, firstly I’m really sorry to know you’re in such a situation. It sucks. However you seem to have a level headed plan for the future. Don’t listen to folks who are suggesting you to stay married just for the sake of kids/ family blah blah blah. Cheating is a dealbreaker and nothing can amend that.

The toughest part is the legal battle ahead of you and you making sure that you don’t end up with a bad deal by the court. Therefore, don’t confront. Gather evidence. Pretend to act normal until you have it all and are confident that your case is strong. Only then proceed with filing a case etc. 

Best of luck OP. More power to you.  Whether you want a divorce or not is entirely your decision. Don't listen to any of the toxic advice on here regarding that. 

The best thing you can do now is think of her purely as the mother of your children and not your wife. Try and be as mature as you possibly can for the sake of your children. 

Asking for full custody of your children (hence depriving them of a mother) because she cheated on you is unfair on you, her and MOST importantly your children. It will also make you look vengeful and petty. More than that it will really affect your relationship with your kids in the future. Her cheating on you is no indication of her being a bad mother. 

Lastly, for god's sake DO NOT try to track her communication, stalk her or snoop around. As you know it's illegal and if the court/she find out, it will make you look really, really bad. You say you are not planning to do that to gather evidence for the court. Why else are you doing this then? How on earth will doing this help you deal with the situation? You say she is dramatic but if you do this then you are fighting fire with fire. 

Go to a good lawyer and listen to them. Reddit is not the place to get advice for this stuff. This place is full of immature teens and young adults who have no idea what you are going through and they've probably never been in a relationship before. They are (self-admittedly) giving you advice based on movies!! You don't need this right now. Go to a lawyer and stop listening to reddit. 

I'm sorry for what you are going through. I hope you are able to deal with this well and be there for your children. This is going to be really difficult for them so try and make it as easy as possible for them. Don't make them choose between you and her, they need both parents. Good luck OP :) Fucking hoes man. And the damage is almost unrepairable. 
Been so long,  I still can't trust anyone. 
Good luck mate. How old are your kids? It's very difficult for the father to get custody of his teenage children. You should take advice from the PI only regarding snooping her. Is that even legal? And why don't you confront her, it will be messy but might really prevent some miscommunication on your part. You can't monitor her phone and social media, that's illegal.  Don't break the law as part of collecting evidence any sensible lawyer she hires will have that shit thrown out and hurt your case irreparably. I'd say it's lucky that she doesn't know you know, keep it that way and follow the advice of your lawyer. Hello OP, sorry to read about the pain you are experiencing. I know that extra marital affairs have become extremely common in India and most people including the cheating spouse are not aware of the problems and pains it causes, which can be extreme. Many people have given you advice in this thread so I won't try to offer you that, but I request something from you. From reading your replies it is clear that you have experienced a great psychological trauma. I want you to please share your thoughts and feelings about this major incident of your life. What went through your mind, did you feel disgusted, insulted, outraged, what kind of topics did you think a lot upon, etc. I think this will help many people who are reading this thread and it may also help you release some built-up pressure by explaining in detail your pain and suffering. I'll be very obliged. a. In cases of adultery, the married one most of the times isn't willing to give up the marriage for the lover's sake. The lover is dropped like a hot potato when the marriage is at stake. If you are open for reconciliation, you can go through therapy to fix things. Obviously it's hard to place faith in someone involved in infidelity. But it's your choice. You have kids. If you don't want your kids to grow up without their mother, you can consider this option.

b. Technical info like call logs, location history etc. is tracked by Google Activity by default unless turned off. But you need access to her gmail id to avail that. It could be add on to whatever you gather from PI. 

Wish you the courage and strength to face this difficult times.  [deleted] Welcome to the club. Enjoy your future days !!! [deleted] When you finally decide to talk this over make sure you are ready with all sorts of trail and evidence. Ok I know you’re upset and you have every right to be, but you’re asking for full custody because she cheated? You’re going to take your anger which you justifiably have towards your wife on your children by depriving them of their mother. I’m not sure how the law works where you are but where I am, emails and all that begotten without consent of the other person do not count in a court of law. Hire a PI. And also, do what’s best for your kids. She may be a shit wife but she has a right also to her children.  This is not the right forum. Consult, r/relationships, r/relationship_advice, specifically mention that you are in India. Hi, its upsetting to read this, but from my experience of being standing and seeings a frnds irreparable marriage.. i would like to suggest something.. is it the first instance this this is happening? I mean had your alwaays marriage been in problems? How did this all start..? The the distance between 2 of you increasing after any particular event? What i want to say is the the cheating only reason? Had she never loved you? The cheating is more of a need for love or togetherness or just cheating? Also one more thing.. has your daily life with her gone worse.. like daily fights or and things? Or u just act cool and she does too? Just pretend we all are cool and lovely?

 I may sound wrong.. but we all know when things start to go wrong, the distance between people starts increasing.. if you really love her.. and you can find a human reason for what she is doing can that can be repaired.. i would suggest you take a higher stand than her.. i know its hard. But at the end you would know u are better, u gave her chance.. maybe there might be some mistakes u must have made on the way, that she wanted to distance from you.. and find love somewhere else . But you know we are humans, and we need love .
The only thing i would to suggest you is if feel this is not cause of the distance that had been growing since time . U keep gathering your evidence.. and keep it safe.. look it at a perspective of why would she do that.. find a reason in those evidences and history u have together.. sometimes people drift away in search of love... I donno who to blame in these cases.. but as a person with understanding the human nature can we give try to give human instinct some chance? I think we can... 

From my experience.. i would suggest u gather evidences, with mere goal of knowing whats wrong( if this looks more like cheating than just a person trying to go away)..u will know if its  a sexual escapade or a find for love.. u will be able to see those in chats or anything.. while at it, i would suggest u try to talk to her.. not openly.. maybe ask her whats wrong why has your relationship detoriated over time(if it has) maybe she wont open up.. it will take time.. make sure you u dont sound like u are accusing her of cheating... Coz  that thing is going to make her feel guilty as hell and she wont let u know anything further..

If your goal is to just leave her.. then dont think about what i have said above.. but is you plan it know things and what has gone wrong, coz all this pain you and u cant bliv this has happened.. u can try to talk and know whats wrong.. no need to present evidences.. maybe she comes back if she starts to realise the distance has increased and she has done a grave mistake.. 

All d best OP. We humans are the capable of mistake as well as forgiveness.. dont forget this dont need to continue.. u may have already tried all those things i have said above.. maybe u are at the brink on ""no way out"".. so i can understand.. u need to have ur freedom too.. ur peace of mind too.. have a great day OP. [deleted] I can give you the exact value of PI. Don't monitor her personal stuff. It doesn't look good on your part.

Questions you need answer to yourself.  how is she as a mother? Would the kids be okay with you getting sole custody? It seems like you have not confronted with her yet. May be you have not been available much to her. She is human after all. This is perfectly repairable, you need to be more understanding and accepting. Don't take this step. Ignore other guys advising about divorce, collecting proof etc. It depends :

1. Try to hint to her and warn. See if it can improve the situation.

2. If you really love her or she loves you, there is still hope.

3. If you believe in virginity and all those stuff.

4. By all means try to fix it and live with her. Else life of kids will be a mess. If mother has affair that can hurt kids badly (if father has affair, not that much).

Think well and decide. 
All the best.  Man. Try to amend this relationship. You are breaking your home.

You are looking into years of litigation, including dowry, maintainance, child custody, and possibly defamation/rape/more if your wife is clever. Your whole life will become a mess. Children divided.

Do yourself a favor. Don't get involved in this mess. I am facing such mess and it's not worth it.

Give her one last warning. And discuss the problems frankly with her. Maybe you are not giving her enough time. She is a human after all.",2019-03-02 21:45:42
AskIndia,[AskIndia] Currency exchange to EUR - Help!,1,dcvch3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcvch3/askindia_currency_exchange_to_eur_help/,7,"Hi,

I'm going to Italy later this month and I'm really confused about what I should do about currency. I'm from Bangalore and I've asked around. I get different opinions about exchanging. 

Some people think I should find an exchange here in Bangalore which gives the best rate; others think that I should just use my debit card and some others think that I should get a forex card from my bank.  

For anyone who's well versed with this, what's the best thing to do here? I'd really appreciate some advice.

UPDATE: I ended up getting an ICICI Bank Multi currency travel card because:

1. ICICI Bank is my primary bank account and the process was quick.

2. I didn't see significant differences in exchange/conversion rates across other banks.

3. ICICI allows me to recharge my travel card through my iMobile app, even from abroad. This was a huge plus. 

Additionally, I used bookmyforex.com to get some currency notes delivered to me. It was super convenient, so I highly recommend it to anyone else who's travelling.",straysandcurrant," If you are going for a short trip, I’d recommend a Visa credit card. Probably HDFC Regalia which I trust to have the least conversion charges across. I have been through this, If you know trusted sources and can find a trustable money exchanger then exchange your Forex with them and get the card from a bank. Banks overcharge by a huge margin for all Forex transactions including the Forex card. But you know in the end of the day your card will work or some sort of guarantee from the bank, local money exchangers are cheap but they come with risk. Paytm forex worked fine for me. Please do have some physical currency euros. You arrange for it even before gng to the airport.
Airport exchange rates a quite expensive. UPDATE: I ended up getting an ICICI Bank Multi currency travel card because:

AskIndia,"[AskIndia] What brands of personal grooming (shampoo, soaps, face wash etc) are actually of a good quality and you refuse to cheap out on?",129,aoo0i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aoo0i0/askindia_what_brands_of_personal_grooming_shampoo/,152,I feel like most budget brands are very harsh and do more harm than good. ,gymshoos," Thank you OP for this thread. Lot's of useful info
 Stop using head and shoulders. Go sulfate free. Use conditioner, everytime you shampoo. Shampoo 3 times a week or less. Stop taking ice cold showers, take hot shower to open up pores and exfoliate, then go cold to close up your pores, moisturize your skin when you get out after you dry off. Drink more water. Wash your face every day and moisturize after. 

Stop using head and shoulders, it is too alkaline for your skin and the fact is you probably dont have dandruff. Flakes is not dandruff. 

Hair styling products (salons sell) will not make your hair fall out. Hot water will not make your hair fall out. I dont care what your friend said they are wrong. Turmeric will not make your hair grow more. Henna is bad, I know it's natural, I know your people have used it for 1000s of years. It is bad for your hair. 

Pomade is your friend, dont be afraid.

-sincerly your friendly American stylist who works with tons of Indian tech guys. Forest Essentials. Olay facewash, a light yellow colored packet, beats others to the dust in terms of skin friendliness and its impact. 

Garnier and such brands are so heavy on the skin. Vicco Turmeric, nahi cosmetic. Vicco turmeric cosmetic cream! Half the products mentioned here, I had never heard the brand names before now !  
I didn't know such things existed !!  
What science, what technology!!!  
Is this India? Face wash - Avene Cleanance Gel. Costs a bomb but the quantity is huge and value for money.

Moisturiser - ~~Avene~~ Aveeno moisturising lotion. It moisturises really well without making the skin feel oily or greasy.

Shampoo - I usually keep changing them after a few months. Started using St. Botanica recently. Too early to give an opinion.

Soap - I use Biotique Almond Oil soap(for lazy days) and keep trying different body washes. Current one is from Palmolive. I like it because it has a scrubby texture. CeraVe was nice but global shipping on Amazon takes time now I just use Cetaphil.  I have long curly hair so most shampoos make my hair super dry and brittle. I switched to biotique sulphate free shampoo and it has made a huge difference but I dont think biotique is like an expensive brand. 

If you feel something is harsh try to read the ingredients list and pick shampoos and soaps that are milder. I cheap out on a lot of stuff especially make up but the only thing I feel I have to spend money on for quality is perfume.  Life Buoy and Dettol products for asli mard. Patanjali if you want skin cancer. Medimix. The hard green one. Lush. Body Shop.  I'm almost 17 and I use johnsons baby shampoo and my hair is good [deleted] Fabindia Daily Use Shampoo fiama ke bath soap and gel...

especially wo purple wala. All I use is soap. I don't care what soap it is. Usually something normal like Lux, Mysore Sandal,etc. I stopped using everything else. Was addicted to Ponds body lotion for the last 10 years and have been addicted to steaming hot water baths all my life. So I started cold water showers.  I stopped using shampoos and conditioner as well. /r/NoPoo. Also was using hair products like smoothing serum n all of that. I have long hair that goes down to over half of my back.

All of it was starting to become a bit too much really. I used to face a lot of inconvenience while traveling. Cant have a bath if there's no hot water or shampoo/conditioner or body lotion. A lot of maintenance and effort and as a guy i felt i don't have to deal with all of this bullshit. I don't have the time and got more important things to deal with. And life is so much fucking better and simpler now. Now as long as I have just the bare essentials which I need(bath soap, toothbrush, toothpaste and a tongue scraper), im good to go anywhere :) Gaumutra Proraso for all shaving needs. A customer for 9+ years and their products are top tier. [deleted] Shampoo - If you can afford it for regular use Kerastase Densifique is really really good to control hairfall. I have been using it regularly for a year now and results are amazing. Not for dandruff control though. Use something else for that, along with Kerastase Face : Cetaphil cleanser, cerave moisturizer

Hair care : shea moisture shampoo, wow coconut oil conditioner. 

Body : loccitane shea butter soap (this is maybe the best thing I have found in recent years), cerave moisturizer again. 

Shaving : trigodon shaving soap, nivea sensitive after shave balm (this stuff is good)

hair styling : lockhart's goon grease pomade 

Fragrance : a few EDPs from Swiss Arabian (very high quality for the price, especially if you live in uae )

Everything listed here can be bought off of Amazon.in Cetaphil light moisturiser, palmers night cream. Anything non comedogenic is good. Stopped using manufactured bullshit a while back. For shampoo, buy amla, reetha, shikakai, boil it together, if you wanna store, freeze it. Lovely simple stuff for hair.
As an alternative to soaps, face wash, get multani mitti, gulaab jal, dahi, milk, i have a rose powder don't know what it's called, basically take different things, figure out what works well for your skin, mix & match & make ubtan out of it. Tum bhi saaf, Nahane ke baad wala paani bhi saaf.
It's not cheaping out, there really isn't anything in the market I think is good enough. I don't use it because I don't know all the shit they put in it.  Mysore Sandal Soap, Himalaya face wash, Biotique soya shampoo. Anything Nivea. I swear by it. Shaving foam, shampoo, face wash, moisturise r, everything. It's just good. And also not exorbitantly expensive. 

I Just don't find nivea soap that easily,  **Nivea Men's Oil Control Face Wash** - 
It's not really expensive but is a must if you have oily face. Also I love the cool menthol feeling

**Alfred Sung Cologne** -

This scent combines the freshness of basil with the earthy tone of sage. Juniper berries and caraway add a sweet, floral essence to the masculine scent, and its pepper note adds a hint of spiciness. Just one or two sprays will leave you smelling clean and feeling fresh throughout the morning and afternoon.


 search for paul Mitchell on Amazon  I prefer Biotique BioApricot.  Great Body Wash.

&#x200B;

I used Body Shop for a long time. But Biotique is by far the most luxurious and cost effective thing.  Use fiama or nivea men shower gel, i like them both [deleted] If you are with a beard, try Cinthol beard and face wash, beard oil and wax.
They are not cheap. But they are very cheap in comparison to the competition. Coconut virgin oil from Amazon instead of the regular parachute. Costs double but my hair love it. Idk what it is with parachute oil but it sucks. Nothing, it is all bollocks, I use bar soap and coconut oil. Himalaya Neem face wash and Nykaa Rosehip Oil for moisturiser  I would recommend Mysore sandal soap. It has the highest TFM 80%. Medimix soap. The BodyShop, Clinique

&#x200B;

Edit: About two months back switched to Skinkraft's range of customized face care products(cleanser, moisturizer and night cream). I am not using them daily as recommended, but have noticed a difference in appearance, mainly, more clear skin and fading of some dark spots. The main compliment I can give them is that there products do not cause any irritation.  Nivea all the way.
Body wash,
Face creme,
Moisturizer,
Chapstick,
Face wash,
Cleansing milk.

That's my nivea routine Soap - Life boy and Dettol. Despite all the shit about scented and what not by the competition, there's one thing you must remember. You live in India. Everything smells, you need as much anti-bacterial stuff as humanly possible to remain alive. So ditched the scented stuff and stick to Life Bouy and Dettol # Patanjali Forever My favorite soap is Cuticura. Rest I am yet to find something that I can stick to. Currently using Brylcreem Shampoo and Bombay Shaving Company face wash. Both are fine.  Old Spice. The body wash and underarm sticks from the US, cream and aftershave from here. 
 Anyone follows this YouTube channel Fit Tuber. He made a series about all these products based on ingredients. His claims are scientific but I'm not able to confirm them. Does anyone know how valid his claims are? Neutrogena facewash Cetaphil is an amazing face cleanser. It's worth a buy. 
For body products the body shop is one of the best brands you can buy. 
And , Boutique is another. The difference being, boutique is relatively cheap.  Kama ayurveda is good  [deleted] Khadi.  Aha Glow for face wash, just awesome... Patanjali You should checkout fittuber [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw)

What are the genuine past results in Maths optional by NextIAS?

I am an engineer by education. I was teaching Maths for JEE till recently. Maths is easy for me to study. I am at home right now and have completed Numerical Analysis and ODE myself. I can do the whole syllabus by myself but the only problem is CONSISTENCY. I am not being able to make consistent efforts and being at home is a big distraction. I may not be able to complete the syllabus at time this way.

Have no idea about Next IAS but you say consistency is your problem, then how are you going to study GS? See, initially everyone faces similar problems. I started preparing in May 2018 (without any coaching) and even I faced similar problems. It was almost like I didn't even know what I was doing. Even today I can't remember what exactly did I do in all those months. But time will teach you everything, all you need is discipline and focus.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] How do people propose here,16,bym2mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bym2mk/askindia_how_do_people_propose_here/,29,"I haven't heard a single story about fancy proposals here, do you or anyone you know tell how they proposed their girlfriend",alcoholicfox," Propose here in India means said Love You, do you mean marriage proposal. In India if you are in a relationship, then you already are talking about marriage and how to convince your parents from day 1 of your relation. So there will hardly be any space or suspense to propose marriage. ""To hum rishtaa pakkaa samjhe?""


i.e. Shall we consider this (marriage) proposal confirmed? deti hai toh de warna gaand mara Guys can be creepy. They don't realize that they are being creepy, which is the pitiful and sad condition of India. Also, most healthy relationships root from friendship, so I don't get the concept of friendzone. Also, I have seen girls rejecting guys just for fun so they can be vicious.

I've also noticed lack of confidence in many guys. 

""What would you do if I proposed you?"", ""I love you""...on WhatsApp. I mean, am I supposed to take it seriously.

The best was when I received a plant with a note attached to it in person, because the guy noticed that I didn't like the fact how flowers just go to waste after gifting. It was something thoughtful and I really adored it. 

So yeah, it depends. (If you re planning to propose, it totally depends on person. I am not a fan of roses and all the cliche things but she/he might be. You need to know the person to actually like them, or is it just 'love at first sight'?) Mummy Ko bhej dete hai fruit ki basket de kar with a red chunni, a few dried dates and a proposal for rishta...

Ladki set kar ke hi aati hai mummy jee 🙏 
I'm assuming you know the other party before hand otherwise that will be creepy.

If you guys have been in a relationship with a decent courting period and you think that it's time to take your realtionship to the next level, ask your SO if she'd be interested to finally tie the knot.
If you get a yes, call at home and set up a meeting.

They'll manage the rest of the hassle. Dekh fancy Proposal nahi karta reject hogaya to it's embarrassing. Better to do it alone indoors after sex when Oxy is high in the brain. Haan bolneke chances badh jate hai. കിട്ടുമോ..??",2019-06-10 00:35:28

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

1. Wash your hands frequently
2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets
7. Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products
8. If you become sick while travelling, inform crew, seek medical attention early and share travel history.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

- Shared by the director of IITD El Salvador has cancelled all rent, water, phone, internet, electricity bills for three months AND they’re building a hospital in case of a major outbreak. A third world country did that. 

There's been one case so far. India's daily numbers are seeing a 29-30% rise day on day. 

19/3- 199 cases

20/3- 258 cases

21/3- 331 cases


Also why the flying fuck are people fixating on Jack Ma not giving freebies to India. We have our own billionaires, go ask them. Why such entitled behaviour? People really need to keep in mind that the results of these lockdowns will only show after a week or two because there will be more cases coming that were very likely contracted before the lockdowns. Do NOT be discouraged that the numbers were high today. The lockdowns will definitely flatten the curve. Your healthcare system is unprepared for this. 
As a part of the system, I can tell you why. 
The institutions primed for dealing with the crises are short-sighted, only bothered with serving their masters, and at certain level, just plain ignorant. 

Hospital stockpiles are running low with the outbreak on the horizon. For months, individuals have asked for reviews and checks. For weeks I have personally tried to push the management to repurpose old ventilators. To acquire new ventilators. To stock disposable oxygen supply equipment. To have discussions with manufacturers and research institutes. To establish protocols. To check inventory. To brainstorm ideas for minimizing infections in the hospital staff (for people only under observation, why not use video chat to review symptoms and do a check up with connected digital stethoscope and monitors? Would save a lot of PPE equipment and reduce exposure). To assign emergency roles. To establish a secure food supply for the staff. To ensure they stay on campus in provided accomodation, so that risk of spreading disease outside is low. 

All have fallen on deaf ears, even now. Please don't listen to your celebrity doctors. They do not understand the real life constraints in a government hospital. 

At this point, please do your part to sensitize your neighbours and relatives. People coughing on the streets is now YOUR business. Stand up and tell them off. Understand and spread awareness that these aren't vacations for kids; the aren't supposed to be playing with 50 other kids in the playgrounds. Or meeting with 10 others inside the house. 
Keep your elderly and sick safe. Now is not the time to let then wander about to bask in the sunshine. 
As a community, approach your local hospitals (telephonically) and tell them you are willing to help out if there be need. So that hospitals keep running. 

Remember, even if covid-19 fatalities turn out to be low, it is the strain on the resources that will affect/kill more. People with heart attack who would have otherwise survived, won't now. Something as simple as appendicitis will also likely kill. 

Secure your paperwork. Ask for your elderly and sick to prepare advance directives. 

And know that when the hell breaks lose, we only have each other. Be compassionate. Don't give into despair. Good of him to remind that dont cut off wages of the poorer sections (your maids, cleaners,etc.) BJP MP who has commented on Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi being from Italy and bringing Corona virus to India has also met Dushyant Singh **Arvind Kejriwal:**

https://m.businesstoday.in/story/first-made-in-india-covid-19-test-kit-by-mylab-gets-commercial-approval/1/399007.html


> Pune-based molecular diagnostics company Mylab Discovery Solutions Pvt Ltd, which specialises in molecular diagnostic kits has developed first made-in-India test kit for COVID-19 in a record time of six weeks. The kit -- Mylab PathoDetect COVID-19 Qualitative PCR kit -- is the first one to receive commercial approval from the Indian FDA/ Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). Besides, Mylab is the only Indian company to have achieved 100 per cent sensitivity and specificity in the ICMR evaluation. This corona thing and the lockdown taught me that I can hold my urge to smoke cigarettes. 14 days since my last smoke. I think I'd continue this streak even after things get back to normal. The moment he said, ""Mitroon, aaj raat 12 baje se"", I knew shit was going to hit the fan. I had to go to a market yesterday for necessities. I was expecting a few vegetable shops and pharmacies to be open. But omg EVERY shop was open. From curtain draperies to mobile accessories. And all of them were crowded af. We’re all worried our asses off and people are everywhere like flies. No way there are only 170 cases in India even if we have “immunity”. Lol

My labrador was silent all day long but at 5pm started barking and rushed to the balcony while people were making noise.

My dog is secret sanghi all along, what to do now? One person near my locality, which is a rural area were taken as a suspected covid19 positive by contact tracing because someone in his class in pune was tested positive. I live 200 km away from pune. Maha govt is at least doing something right Kanika kapoor live on aajtak.. her father said she attended 3-4 parties where she came in contact with 300-400 people..
Few minutes later, she herself comes on a call with Aaj-Tak..she says she hasn't attended any party, her father would never say it..

Repeats ""I'm an educated lady, I decided to come to Lucknow because my parents live here, I didn't know the situation is so bad in india, nobody told me about this""

Geez I hate this madarchod A girl in my locality returned from Scotland ,she was told at airport (after screening) to go and get tested ,she came home instead and stayed there.


Yesterday police came and took her to the testing center. How many lives is it gonna take for us to get serious ? We're testing about 1000/day with a capacity of 10000/day. That's 10% of our capacity.even if they are denying community transmission, they should atleast test on more than 50% capacity. I was thinking like how things fucking changed all of a sudden.20 days ago it was a whole different world altogether. I was preparing for an exam that was supposed to happen on 31st. I made whole schedule on what to do and how to do and everything. Suddenly everything changed. Like literally went upside down [deleted] Just found out 0 health care workers in South Korea got infected despite their massive testing drive and high number of cases. 

That's an incredible achievement holy shit.

https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tata-group-commits-1500-crore-to-fight-covid-19-11585403361686.html I am a doctor working in one of the reputed government medical college and hospital and just wanted to say that there is a serious lack of personal protective equipments here. Masks and gloves are out of stock, forget about protective goggles and suits. We wrote a letter to the administration demanding to make the PPEs available asap and all they gave us is one cloth mask per person which too doesn't fit properly. All the tiffin services are closed in the city and no one is ready to deliver tiffins to us so we have to eat Maggie, Pasta, Biscuits and chips and stuff like that because the food from hospital canteen sucks and we don't get enough time to cook our own food. People in the building I live in have stopped interacting because I am a doctor and work in the hospital even though I wear double masks till the time I get into my apartment when I throw them into dustbin. All these people who were clapping for us at 5PM on Sunday don't give a damn about us and that's disappointing. So, 50+ new cases today, continuing on the exponential trend. Each day is scarier and scarier. Is anyone else afraid that people might come out tomorrow at 9pm and start celebrating?

It’s funny how people run away from the situation, I feel sometimes creating that little bit of panic, or negativity (which isn’t my intention) is necessary so they take it seriously. Pune : Women from Sinhagad got admitted in Katraj Private Hospital and later tested positive for Covid-19 from NIV. She has **no record of travel history** or **contact with person with travel history**. She is on Ventilator now.

I think we are in community transmission stage but nobody from national main stream media is reporting about it.

Indian democracy is a sham that's always favored the rulers. There's nothing here for the people. Indians: Mera beta engineer, doctor ya lawyer banega

Also Indians:
22nd March is Amavasya, darkest day in a month. All virus, bacteria and evil forces have maximum potential and power on such days. 5 PM- clapping,  shankh nada etc by 130 crore people at the same time will create so much vibrations that virus will lose all potency. Must for everyone.
The 5pm clapping  modi asked us to do is extremely interesting. Someone i know who's studied astrology and knows how to corelate with science. 
At that time Moon is passing to a new 'nakshatra' called Revati.
The playing of bells and clapping: The cumulative vibration will encourage blood circulation in the body. . 
It's the reason they used to have huge, gong-like bells in old Shakti temples on the mountains. 
Someone very knowledgeable is guiding Modi abt this. Hope it works. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/

If you check this site India is today where Italy was 4 weeks ago (Feb 25 -323 cases) look where they are now.

The govt is finally taking good steps like shutting down the railways. I hope that will they increase the testing too and taking care of the food water and meds supply Mizoram state has enforced total lockdown for a week starting today and we don't even have any confirmed case of covid. now each locality in our capital Aizawl has its own public announcement system so the authorities are publicly naming people  who have gone out to their neighbour's houses over the pa system requesting them to immediately return home. 😁 Anand Mahindra on Twitter:

—To help in the response to this unprecedented threat, we at the Mahindra Group will immediately begin work on how our manufacturing facilities can make ventilators. 
—At Mahindra Holidays, we stand ready to offer our resorts as temporary care facilities. (3/5)

—Our Projects team stands ready to assist the Govt/Army in erecting temporary care facilities.                                                     —The Mahindra Foundation will create a fund to assist the hardest hit in our value chain (small businesses & the self employed) (4/5)

—We will encourage associates to voluntarily contribute to the Fund. I will contribute 100% of my salary to it & will add more over the next few months. I urge all our various businesses to also set aside contributions for those who are the hardest hit in their ecosystems (5/5)

I really hope the government does not fail even one of these people.

Edit: I feel deeply sad about this. Each and every living being deserves a good quality of life [deleted] In France, the ""young doctors"" association said today that for 1 confirmed case, 47 go undetected. Alright several things

1) Three days ago on the night of 19/3/19 the case count was 199. Right now
https://www.covid19india.org
Shows the number at 401. So the infection is doubling at 3 days ( instead of 5 days as per the Khan Academy video
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mCa0JXEwDEk
). So its spreading quicker

2) I seen people have linked videos about dumbasses walking down the street in rallies banging utensils and blowing conchshells. How much money would people here put on the fact that these idiots shared those conchshells with one another?


3) Please people self isolate and dont hoard necessities. The govt can easily arrange for it over a long period. Period maintain discipline at grocery stores and other places and keep in mind the social distance. 

4) Please observe queues and dont try to cut into them.

5) Argue with your parents. A lot of them dont grasp the gravity of the situation. I know you folks get irritated but please make an effort. Its in own self interest

Edit : - 6) I dont know if Indian Politician/bureaucrats use reddit, but please help your people. Please dont try to profit off this heard kolkata will shut down from tomorrow eve, i stay in a rented place, i buy my all my meals from local cheap places, i dont have kitchen, not sure what ill do!! The fuck. People are moving about as if coronavirus got eliminated at 9 PM yesterday. *The year is 2025, 5 years since the Chinese lost the first viro-battle. 5 years since we looked up to ""West"" for guidance, as we always had. Italy had lost its battle, so had UK. USA was on its last legs. The nords have formed an alliance now, they seem to know the way.*

*Our streets are empty. Shops are closed. There are gangs of looters scavenging on the carcass of society. There's a stench of rotting meat in the air. The huge hoardings  that once were a beacon of opulence, now lay in tatters, rotten. There are people. We're still a lot. We're hiding in our homes surrounded by broken utensils. Starving. Crying. Wailing. It's been months since many of us have even uttered a word, there's nothing left to talk about anyway.*

*All that changes for a few minutes everyday. We all live for that now. I think it must be important. I hope it works soon. Because at 5pm each day, whoever you are, looter, bandit, survivor, you bang. You bang on whatever you find. It is the one thing you know will bring back life as we know it. This cacophony envelopes the world around us for those 5 minutes. I hope we're doing enough...* What the hell...

And just FYI, no it's not just the last two days of data being taken as a trend, you can see that the rate of growth itself had been decreasing before that as well. My relatives in Mumbai are telling me that the police beat up an rickshaw guy who was transporting an bank employee. I thought financial services were essential, how are the people supposed to reach their work places then. And more over what good does beating people up. Just reduces the public morale. Are police allowed to do such brutality in India Our people wont be under proper lockdown until there's stricter measures.

A news reporter on the TV found a group of 10 people roaming the streets and asks one of them (probably sarcastically) whether they are following the lockdown rules? The woman replies with a straight face that they are indeed following the rules. WTF This lockdown is impacting the daily wage earners in the worst possible way. They are being beaten up by the cops for roaming around on the streets, have nothing to eat, no income to sustain themselves and their family and nowhere to live. 

This is what happens when you don't announce a relief fund before implementing a lockdown. Even more privileged people like me can't anything in stores due to unnecessary hoarding. Can't even imagine what the poor and  homeless people would be going through. 

Hopefully Modi announces a package today. In live press conference, Kejriwal rightly called out neighbours, landlords for discriminating against doctors, airport workers etc.

PM need to do the same at 8pm today. In the 21 days while most of the nation is on a pause, we need a war time production of testing kits, masks, ppe, sanitisers, ventilators, construction of emergency quarantine centers and hospitals to prepare for the infected who will come up after 21 days. Singapore has open sourced its contact tracing app. It needs to be up and running before we hit play in the middle of April. NDTV: India to acquire rapid testing kits used by South Korea and US

Good. Mental health is absolutely down the drain. Police all over the country are showing the kind of psychopaths they are. From slapping and passing derogatory remarks on female doctors to harassing and beating poor people, they have stooped really low at a time when whole country is trying to stand together.

They plan to export 300,000 test-kits per week**](https://twitter.com/vaitor/status/1241337295606657033) I can give a first hand account: 

My complex is a gated community with 8 towers. Total about 500-600 flats. One girl travelled back to India from UK. Started showing symptoms. Within a day, people showed up and tested her, her family, the maid, the people who have been in contact with the maid. 

The girl is recovering well. However the brother tested positive and is also in the hospital. The entire complex is under lockdown. We weren't even allowed to leave the complex today. 

There was a complete disinfection and sanitation done by the authorities. 

There are many things to criticise about this govt, but with the way things transpired - I'm actually happy with the way they acted. 10 cases recovered today. Good news :) Local store has closed after the address. Govt better clarify soon about how they plan to ensure supply of goods and essential services. A 21 year old girl in the UK succumbed to Covid-19, she had no pre-existing health conditions, nor was she overweight or obese. So US has surpassed China but I don't see the panic there . Loads of our clients are still chilled and so are NRI relatives . Is Media keeping them in dark ? With 700 we are shit scared . Shoot us, they screaming.

Big Chaos at New Delhi Int'l Airport T3 this morning.

Now they are holding passports of all arriving passengers, including Indians, till all the tests are done.

Passengers, not allowed to exit, are screaming at Police to shoot and kill them.

Wtf? Italy number of deaths are bigger than China official deaths. That escalated in no time Hello r/india , I'm a small business owner from a tier-2 city.  I own a creative agency. We are into graphic design, digital marketing and web development. I have two employees. We mostly live near to our office and commute by personal vehicles. 

Our city hasn't been impacted yet. All shops, offices, bazaars are open. But business is at an all time low.  

After yesterday's announcement, I'm pretty sure that curfew will extend beyond sunday and from april onwards we may go in to a total lock down mode. 

Since end of Feb, work has dried up. Our clients themselves have low sales. Their customers are not paying them, and they are not paying us. Situation is terrible all around. 

I can afford to pay our employees for a month or two from the current corpus. But not beyond. I'm lower middle class. My employees are poor. They do not own personal laptop or any broadband connection at their home. I've offered to provide them their desktops to their home and set up broadband connection at our cost. 

But I'm not really sure how long this Work From Home will last. Because most of our work comes from local clients.

My daughter was born recently and I have lot at stake. Not really sure how to go about this situation. US and UK still haven’t closed Cimema Halls Gyms etc.

We may  have been really fast with our response but some of these western countries are reacting ridiculously slow Apparently the fourth person diagnosed with Covid-19 in West Bengal had no travel history.

Thaali peeto chutiyon So, I have been quite vocal about calling out stupid people in the apartment complex I live in on r/India. Whenever I get an opportunity to shit on these unkills, aunties and bhakts who live here, I do. However, today, I am taken aback by the amount of effort and coordination my building association is taking to make sure the residents of my apartment complex are safe. From sending regular updates about what is happening, to coordinating with police and BBMP officials for quarantine protocols and just keeping us overall well informed is something I am so thankful for.

No one is showing ego here in doing what they want. They keep their kids at home, no crowding is allowed, common amenities are shut, the building's common areas are regularly disinfected, the support staff here is taken care of in terms of providing them with masks and sanitizers and gloves. Things are very smooth here. I know this post is not very relevant here, but there are people who are at the opposite spectrum of those people who were doing mujra on the road with plates yesterday. And since I have always been quick to jump to make fun of my building people, I just wanted people to know they can be amazing too. I hope everyone gets through this shit safe and sound. We humans are our biggest enemies 😞

The price of eggs, too, dropped from ₹48 to ₹24 a dozen. Conversely, mutton sellers in several parts of the country reported a steep hike in demand.

https://scroll.in/article/956932/interview-suppression-wont-work-in-india-slow-down-the-coronavirus-this-will-be-a-long-haul Despite essential services being exempt, there's hardly any shop you can find open. Even if you do, there's not much you can find there. Besides, you can't even order food online. Insane stuff. Hope it gets over soon. Impossible to live such a life for long. OK good speech and very happy with the lock down and funds for testing and Ppe. But absolutely no clarification on groceries, support for poor, etc. Dear lord I hope there isn't more panic because he didn't clarify things.

They’re helping feed daily laborers Some industries like Insurance and Banks are forced to operate as essential services. Given the lack of transport and general herd mentality, how is safe passage ensured for these? NHS is setting up a volunteer army to help at risk people. India needs something like this!

> Members of the public can sign up quickly and easily at goodsamapp.org/NHS to become NHS Volunteer Responders, and can be called on to do simple but vital tasks such as:

> – delivering medicines from pharmacies;

> – driving patients to appointments;

> – bringing them home from hospital;

> – or making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home.

> NHS Volunteer Responders is not intended to replace local groups helping their vulnerable neighbours but is an additional service provided by the NHS.

> GPs, doctors, pharmacists, nurses, midwives, NHS 111 advisers and social care staff will all be able to request help for their at-risk patients via a call centre run by the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS), who will match people who need help with volunteers who live near to them. Some charities will also be able to refer people to the service

> https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/your-nhs-needs-you-nhs-call-for-volunteer-army/ So the govt is asking for a 3-week lockdown. Fine, I'll do it, we'll all do it. What this will - hopefully - do is flatten the curve, i.e. buy time. Now what the govt needs to do is keep its end of the bargain, use this time well and prepare for the next wave that hits after the lockdown is lifted:

* Procure masks and COVID-19 tests - in huge numbers
* Procure ventilators and other ICU equipment - in huge numbers
* Manpower mobilization (paramedics, nurses, wardboys)
* Build identify or repurpose existing buildings for use as hospitals (China built two hospitals in Wuhan in 10 days! - we can't do that, but we  have 21 days)
* Put in place processes to leverage private hospitals
* Invest people and resources for tightening contact tracing processes
* Work on locally producing treatment drugs
* ...

Again: this is time bought with the people's blood, sweat and tears. I hope they don't let it all go waste. today in ahmedabad a case was found where a woman returned from Dubai had the virus and transmitted it to another family member.

I work in a refinery, and here a close working colleague also had his mother return from Dubai 2 days ago, which he didn't inform anyone about. Arguably he's come in close contact with the entire workforce in my unit in these 2 days. Somehow the management came to know about his mother and has now finally quarantined him.

I am seething with anger, want to break the fucking dumbfuck's face. Streets are so fucking quite, empty and clean that dogs in our street are wondering what the fuck happened to all those stupid humans... >A 65-year-old woman, who serves lunch near a corporate office in Mumbai's Prabhadevi, tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday.

We are a group of volunteers who are trying to build a website that will help in matching supply and demand of masks, ventilators etc. This would be required if our healthcare system gets overburdened, as it surely will as covid-19 starts to wreck real havoc. We shall also be writing STL files and posting them on our website, along with stitching methods, so that anyone with a sewing machine and/or 3D printer can help the country.  


We need front end and back end developers, UI/UX designers, Product design experts(for mask design) and also legal experts who can guide us. If you think you can contribute to our cause , Please help by joining our discord: [https://discord.gg/NS2RZ83](https://discord.gg/NS2RZ83)

P.S.: We are a non profit and volunteer organization. If I have posted in the incorrect sub, please help direct me to the correct one. And please bump this post for greater visibility. Thanks! 150 new cases today, but this is expected, right? I am trying not to panic. As we test more real numbers should come out. Good news will be the graph flattening around mid April, right? If that doesn't happen we are fucked.

Should be sent to jail for a long fucking time! Useless cunt muscle At the start I was excited about wfh and spending more time alone and maybe improving skills or starting a new hobby while at home with all the free time. Now I want it to all end. I'm not doing any hobby or improving any skills rather the scare of virus is eating my head 24 hrs. I'm a nervous wreck right now. Absolutely fucking morons in my society. We have 2 confirmed cases of Corona Virus in our complex. The complex went into a lockdown. No Newspaperwala, doodhwala, maids, etc. 

Some fuckwits instead called their maid, took their car and picked her up and brought her to do housework. Who are they trying to fool? It's for our own good. When will these chutiyas understand that. 

Now, our society is in complete lockdown. No person allowed in or out. This is getting annoying now. People are sending 40 MB videos of celebrities (who obviously do it for PR) banging their plates and clapping and saying “respect”

I hate this celebrity culture and how much important people give to them, also who has time and space to download all these videos. Ugh Absolute shitshow in the Koyambedu bus stand in Chennai... Limited buses only operated and with the sec. 144 from tomorrow announced suddenly, people are flooding the bus stand and fighting for a seat in the buses.

More than 2 people can't be out together, unless living in the same house. All shops to shut, except essential goods. For 3 weeks now, but will review after that (it will surely get extended).

So this is where they got the idea. Worldwide Data

**Total Deaths: 9,785**

**Total Recovered: 84,960**

**Total Confirmed: 235,404**

Isn't this alarming? The mortality rate is quite high. Why are people hiding travel history and their condition like it's a murder they've commited? What do you think will happen idiots? That near one of yours will affect you, and others. Can't you be distant for a while. I am sure this is a harrowing time for all of you. 
But stop with the self-centered attitude. Stop wallowing in pity. 
I get that you worked hard for your job/business. I get that you have other important things to take care. I understand you may be anxious. 
But you aren't helping the situation. Running away to your hometowns, you will result in a greater spread of infection. Keep the rural and semi-urban areas as spared as possible. 

If you want some perspective, in coming weeks, doctors in this country may be dealing with lakhs of sick patients in a resource-scarce institutions. We won't get to see our families. We will fall sick. We will lose some colleagues. Some of us will die. 
If you think we are in it for money then let me tell you that the hazard pay we will get is Rs. 300/day. 

So you, sitting in your home with less money than you would otherwise have, with less freedom or luxury than you would otherwise have; you don't get to complain. 
Bear with it. Be prepared.

The cases will peak - those infected till today will be detected in the next 14-21 days. But we have taken the first step. People don't know how dangerous it is, the general public doesn't, and that's why all the hoarding. Hopefully they follow this up with med infra, testing and more testing. It'll get better, let's do our bit and stay home. Also, PSA, anyone can get it. So all the shaming has to stop. People who have not gone abroad and not made contact may also get it - it's a big ass country with a lot of people. So please no shaming. We all should behave like we already have it and stay home to reduce spread, that's it.

Chennai, Kanchipuram and Erode districts of Tamil Nadu sealed. These are three of the 75. Children are playing outside in my neighbourhood and most of the people relaxing and chit chatting outside. So the second patient's parents and maid is also positive. WB went to 7 cases. why is ICMR data not released at 6pm ? I've been checking the ICMR updates for the past few days, and what is worrisome is the increase in percentage of positives over time. It has gone from 1% to 1.5% to 2% yesterday to 2.3% today. 

&#x200B;

Two things of note

&#x200B;

1. The rate of increase in percentage of positives from update to update is accelerating.

&#x200B;

2. In my understanding, they were earlier denying testing to anyone with symptoms if they didn't have association to international travel in some way (directly or indirectly). Now they seem to be testing general population with pneumonia (or similar) symptoms and are actually turning up more positives than earlier. If airports are open, are airport taxis running? If not, that's strange. If yes, are they allowed to go to gurgaon, for example? WTF every country seems to have people who have gone bonkers

Telangana CM says there are 19313 foreign returnees in the State and are on home quarantine- all of their passports will be seized for now. If they are still found escaping quarantine- their passports will be suspended.

Wow! one of the best decision. Clarification on reporting by Republic TV on alleged violation of lockdown/curfew by Director(Medical), ESIC Hospital, Noida(Uttar Pradesh)

https://twitter.com/esichq/status/1242467362537738241?s=21 Overcrowded grocery, veg, fish & meat stores. Day 1 of lockdown is pretty much useless. There needed to be more communication and reassurance about essential items being made available no matter what. PM tweeted later about this how much of India looks at Twitter? 

Moreover, what he says should happen and what ends up happening are normally two different things. He had assured people that demonetization would go smoothly, there would be no panic etc. What was the reality? Long queues in front of Banks/ATMs and them running out of cash and ending up in a lot of unnecessary deaths. I saw the same panic yesterday after the announcement - long queues in grocery shops with everybody hoarding. And unfortunately a lot of poor people are going to die again. 

Now, most people here would claim that this may not be on our PM and that we had no choice but to lockdown. To that I agree, however, the way it was communicated and handled was abysmal and being the PM of the country the final accountability does rest with him. It is a tough job no doubt but that is why he chose to be the PM. Hey guys what do you think will happens to engineering (or any other)colleges for these 21 days?

Those manning supply chains of perishable products will need sustenance. Fresh produce like milk, fruits and vegetables arrive into most metros through a complex ‘just in time’ supply chain. If farmers are unable to go to farms to harvest the produce, if workers are unable to load it onto trucks, if trucks are not able to drive it into cities, if  smaller vendors are prevented from accessing wholesale markets, if those vendors can’t transport what they buy to retail shops in residential neighbourhoods — then existing stocks of essentials will dry up within days.

Lockdown will only control the spread. 


I don't see any solution apart from a vaccine and its mass scale production. 
And given how far this is the future looks 
scary as hell. was just thinking about the kids, in the long run this is only going to add to the stress, the academic calendar is gonna be fucked, admissions to colleges are gonna be fucked, most probably summer vacations will be cancelled. When does the remaining annual exams and entrance tests like NEET, JEE etc gonna take place? Also if the lockdown extends to 3 months what happens to college exams? 2020 can get fucked The numbers dont make sense in India. 

Highest number Of cases was on 23/3 with 102 cases but after that it has got subdued instead of an exponential increase.

Dont get me wrong the compounded growth rate from start of 20/3(199 cases on end of 19/3) to yesterday (735 cases) is still 20% per day.

 But the number series by itself doesnt make sense. In the beginning of this time frame the growth rate was around 30% but then its falling to about 11% yesterday. This drop in growth has no reason (as far as I know)


Any statistics ppl willing to make a comment ?

Figures are based on https://www.covid19india.org/

Edit :- You can compare this with Malaysia on Worldometer website who have been on lockdown for 10 days but still saw an 13% increase in cases yesterday 26/3

https://mobile.twitter.com/HFWOdisha/status/1240683355332431872 Saw in news channel tickers around 25 new cases today itself. 

This feels like phase 3 for sure... Some calculations:

1. Consider mortality rate to be 1%

2. Average days to die for an infected person = 18

3. No. of days it takes to double the cases = 6


So, if 5 people die today, it means 500 people (point 1) were infected 18 days ago (point 2). Let's call it Day Zero. 

If 500 people were infected on Day Zero, then on Day 6, the number must have been 1000 (point 3). On Day 12, 2000 people must have been infected. And on Day 18, 4000 people must have been infected.

It means 5 deaths today corresponds to 4000 infected people today assuming we are not able to catch everybody. as expected many cases coming out of the hole. the next month is going to be something.

How do they transmit the virus if they are not coughing or sneezing? Idk about where you guys are, but I am extremely proud of the way my neighbourhood is behaving. Nobody is outside. Roads are completely empty, No kids playing downstairs. All uncles working from home. No Maids, No Newspapers, No Doodhwaala. Didn't expect people to co operate so well > High alert sounded in Karimnagar after one person tests COVID positive

> The person moved closely with the visiting Indonesian preachers who were tested positive; another 70 persons who too moved closely identified as suspects, say police

Punjab has declared a mandatory curfew since people were not respecting the lock down. [deleted] I'm fucked, pharmacy in my city is closed and I have vitamin B deficiency and always eat those capsules, I haven't had medicine since 3 days and canker sores are popping up in my mouth, have been eating a fuck ton of carrots to compensate Dad just called and told me that he saw news that all domestic flights to be cancelled from Tuesday midnight. Is this legit?

Also, by Tuesday midnight, is it 12 am tonight or tomorrow 12 am? I have a flight to Kolkata at 7:45 am tomorrow :/ My shop is empty, I sold off every item in my shop, I have some supplies for my own use at home. I can go to City to buy supplies but I am afraid of bringing the virus into my village. I am not looking out for myself but our community as a whole. I have some vegetables grown in my backyard and some potatoes stored in the attic. I will sell them only if need arises. These were grown for my own personal consumption.

Can chickens and other poultry become infected with it? If yes, it may spread to people during slaughtering and butchering them.

I wish I had some biscuits, cheap Mari gold biscuits. My dad works for the central government and he has been asked to come to work tomorrow and on 2 other days before the 31st. His office doesn’t come under essential services. I don’t even know what to say to all these stupid fucks. Local supermarkets have shut down and small stores are being overwhelmed in my area to the point that social distancing is impossible. It's also difficult to procure essentials like bread and milk too.  

I Can't help but think that the janata curfew has caused a mass panic among people and led to hoarding of goods. A shutdown should be implemented in such a way that supermarkets and stores do not have to shut down and only one member of the house should go out for shopping while purchasing only that which he requires for the next two days or so. Uncertainty about the shutdown is causing more panic and the govt doesn't seem to realise this. It's increasing the chances of community spread. It's neither MH nor KL. It's the number of new cases that has reached 100 first. People are gathering in big numbers everywhere just to hoard stuff as they have no idea what's to come

this is TN https://twitter.com/iParisal/status/1242074725989244929?s=19

I’m sure none of them have heard of the word social distancing Grocery shopping will be allowed. Most states were already in lockdown and grocery shopping was allowed. We now have a length of time for the lockdown. Grocery stores khule rahenge ki nahi..?

He made no mention of them. Good news for the people who are trying to go on a diet. Perfect time for new year resolutions. It takes 21 days to make or break an habit. All the best and stay safe. Okay now I can't live with 2 gb jio data limit staying at home 24 hrs. What are some alternatives. Yogi just said don't go to buy milk veggies and shit. They will deliver it to your homes. So that's like 40% of earth's population on lockdown Honestly? Modi needs to give an address to the nation daily now. Not as a 8 PM main special announcement, but a daily update to the nation, with steps taken daily, and a daily assurance of essentials to be available to everyone. This is the only way to stop panic from settling in. No shops are open here. Can't order online either. I mean, I will survive, I have enough to eat at my home. But wondering what would happen to those who don't.

This could have been better planned. I think a lot of cases are not being reported to keep the numbers low. In Chennai the number of houses that are quarantined by the govt are more than the total number of cases in TN. **Coronavirus update: 6 new cases surface in Maharashtra**

Maharashtra Health Department has informed that 6 new positive cases of coronavirus have been reported in the state. Out of them, 5 patients are in Mumbai and 1 is in Thane. Apparently, there have been clashes between the public and cops in Karnataka.

Edit: Some goons tried to beat up the police. Cases will be lodged against them and their parents. I hope at best we can take a lesson from this Pandemic.

1. Upgrade our medical equipment and keep medical supplies to tackle future outbreaks.
2. Provide our govt doctors, nurses equipment they need beforehand. Equipments they have been asking for years now.
3. Listen to medical professionals for advice and not WhatsApp experts.
4. Elect officials who stand behind science and medicine and not gow mutra.
5. How to protect our economy and trade during times like these.

Seriously this is what we should be talking about during local elections and ask candidates what they will do to protect us and our future. > Wednesday's major coronavirus updates:

Third case in Chennai. Travel history from Ireland. Should've stopped international incoming flights in January. > The first coronavirus case in the U.S. and South Korea was detected on the same day. By late January, Seoul had medical companies starting to work on a diagnostic test — one was approved a week later. Today, the U.S. isn’t even close to meeting test demand.

What date did India have its first case on? I was out on the street yesterday, and all the shopkeepers I saw - no exceptions - had a dry cough. Many on the streets as well. Everyone had a bottle of hand sanitiser next to them and masks  they were not wearing. All big shops/showrooms had sanitiser bottles in the entrance so that people sanitise themselves before entering. This was in Delhi. SENSEX is up 2% today without any reason... like today is the worst day among the past 2 weeks in terms of cases, and markets choose today to go green lol

This lockdown has bigger implications than what everyone seems to think.

Fever is coming along with lil fatigue ,body ache and headache.No other symptoms.Her eyes also becoming red n small at times.Body ache has decreased a lot now except waist pain.It all started with a lot of sneezing and eye itching. Can it be Corona? in a thread about female medic getting assaulted by police there are comments lashing out on indian space program. stay classy worldnews So far from what I understand, govt strategy seems to be:

1. Identify people who have travelled abroad/ or come into contact with travelled abroad. Put them in ""observation"" list. **These people are all not being tested**

2. If any from above develop symptoms then they are admitted into hospital and tested. But majority are not tested and the govt is hoping they will cure naturally in 15 days. 


3. Meanwhile others who are not primary contacts but still came into contact with identified people or show any symptoms are being admitted in hospitals if they report severe illness.. 

Correct me if im wrong... 

Will this strategy succeed?

----

If this strategy is to be even remotely successful then lockdown must be in place for a very long time. My guess is 2 or more months, because there is not enough testing done, and govt is waiting for people to report themselves if symptoms develop. Since there is not enough testing, govt cannot know if there are many unreported cases popping up, and removing lock down early could lead to outbreak within India again ...

Thats why govt wants everyone off streets, thus using brute force to enforce it.. 

Also would mean international flights cannot be opened for a long time, till even vaccine is developed... They say 88 cases today

https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI/status/1243192226005434368

But https://www.covid19india.org/ shows 61, but the count is higher. I'm confused now. Anyone show some clarification? Total cases crossed half million. i dont think this shit is gonna end this year wtf i want 2019 back so bad..how tf do we remain sane while locked up inside for months, truly feels like this year's meant to be end of the world **Total cases tops 500,000 globally, death toll at 23,004** Any idea, why italy still has more cases amid lock down? I was thinking 2 weeks is a good time to see a positive result, any one has insight on this? Is there a consolidated list of NGOs that are helping out the poor with free meals and shelter? I have some people asking me who they can donate to. Covid19India showing 843 confirmed cases and a jump of 108 today. Is that correct?! That's a huge jump. As if the Hindu vs muslim wasn't enough, now thanks to coronavirus it's state vs state. What's next? Is there a timing for when I can purchase rations? 

I don't mean vegetables. I mean packed foods like Grams, beans, lentils, spices etc. I went out at 7 A.M. thinking at least groceries stores would be open besides medical stores but none were open. We in Mangalore, Dakshina Kannada (Karnataka) are getting reports of 82 confirmed cases + 40,000 quarantine (yes, thats right !) in our neighboring border district of Kasargod (Kerala). So is community spread already in place? I am afraid whether the lockdown will be extended or not. I have a feeling this lockdown is gonna be extended for at least one more month till May. I think official count will hit 1000 today. We have long painful time ahead. >COVID-19 cases rises to 873; death toll stands at 19: Union Health Ministry

Kaise madarchod log rehte hein yaar iss country m🤦 Locking down everything and 'flattening the curve' will be useless unless we significantly increase our medical infrastructure and personnel during the lockdown itself.

Akshay Kumar donates 25 Crores to Fight Corona Virus we will never reach the count of Italy, USA, China, Spain because we will never test that much Some of the myths that are still prevailing on the internet. Mostly by the shameless bhakts defending this govt.

MYTH1: We don't need to test more as it would put enormous burden on our healthcare systems. 

FACT 1: [WHO has recommended to TEST, TEST, TEST ](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/-test-every-suspect-who-chief-coronavirus-message-to-world-1656211-2020-03-16)

MYTH 2: We don't have enough test kits. And that's why Govt has not been able to increase the # of Tests PM. 

FACT 3: [ICMR has claimed that there is no dearth of test kits. And they don't even need the help of Private players at this point in time.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/icmr-intensifies-random-testing-to-check-for-covid-19/articleshow/74643047.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst) The amount of cognitive dissonance that I am going through is unbelievable. I mean when I come here on web, news sources, twitter, reddit, etc,. everything tells me situation is bad and I tried to tell my relatives to take this seriously and not joke about it. They still are going to office and joking around. 

Now can anyone please help me understand what is actual situation because our news channels are not covering as much as they should have. My parents have been getting really worried being at home watching all the frightening news and nowhere to go since last week. Today, I saw them getting ready for this at 4.50 pm. As much as I wanted to tell them not to do it, I couldn't because I could see the excitement in their eyes for the first time in days.

Good decision but I hope PM clarifies on air that people will be allowed to go to get groceries and stuff. Otherwise there will be big panic. This is a good decision to lock down the country for 21 days. But as is the case with India, the implmentation will be shit. Will the grocery and other essential things be open?

Doesn't self quarantine mean that they need to be at home, in a room with no contact with anyone in their family too?? Do people not know this? Time for a new thread. Recent good comments are getting lost since we can't sort by best and this day So got a message from Metropolis Testing center that they are now testing for corona virus and they will come to home to collect samples and deliver result in 24 hrs is this true can anyone confirm ? I clapped today at 5, it wasn't to kill the virus with vibrations or anything, it was to pay my respect for all the health workers who has worked /is working day and night to make this world a better place. May god shine infinite blessings on you people. Housing society threatens to evacuate these NE girls from their apartment, creates chaos. Until police steps in and gives assurance ! India- this is the racist face you have ! It’s double crisis for Us, first battle with virus and then with societal virus of racism !

https://twitter.com/manoranjanpegu/status/1241800160960753667?s=19 TN is back to normal life. Whatever isolation happening is only self-imposed. There is no directive from TN govt on curfew. This is despite Central govt clearly identifying 3 districts in TN to be locked down. This despite TN having a doctor as Health Minister. TN govt is such a disgrace. Will not be surprised if we see a spike in cases 5-13 days from now. Just seeing people out here panic buying and videos of police beating up people literally trying to buy essential commodities will not go well If you know any doctor in Chennai who might need a car or two-wheeler to commute, PM me. I can lend my vehicles. I am currently stranded at the Delhi airport. The officials are telling us to back as they won't accept travellers after 18 March. Interestingly, even though we came on an AirIndia flight, they don't know that it was scheduled for arrival! Don't know what to do now.

Edit : They are finally allowing us in. We'll be kept in a government facility for quarantine. Hope everything will turn out fine. Rumours are being circulated that EMERGENCY will be imposed around 8PM. Just watched [this](https://youtu.be/mCa0JXEwDEk) video. So, in the video, it is asserted that, 

(1) if we assume the mortality rate to be 1%, 

(2) the time from contracting the virus to death be 20 days, 

(3) And the days in which the infected persons double is 5 days. 

basically, if one person died today, then by (1), at the date, 20 days earlier, in which the victim contracted the virus, there would be 100 (99 to be precise) others who were infected.

So, 5 days after he contracted, the number of infected persons would be 200, 10 days ago, it would be 400, 15 days ago, it would be 800 and today, the number of infected people would be 1600!!. So, after 20 days from now, the deaths would be around 16. 

That's why it's crucial to sit the fuck at home, *if you can*, and not be an asshole planning trips or going to office to Lick your boss's ass. My mom takes home tuitions, I am tired of trying to convince her to stop doing it and ask kids to stay home. Even said schools are shut and kids are freely gonna be promoted.

Men are twice as likely to die from Coronavirus than women, say experts.

As per John Hopkins scholar, immune systems in females are more exuberant. Women in general fight viruses better. They also produce stronger responses after vaccinations, have enhanced memory immune responses. 

But this comes as a high price, women are far more susceptible to autoimmune diseases in which the immune system goes into overdrive and attack the body’s own tissue and organs. Nearly 80% of autoimmune disease victims are women.

The reasons women have stronger immune responses aren’t entirely clear, and the research is still at an early stage, experts caution.

One hypothesis is that women’s stronger immune systems confer a survival advantage to their offspring, who imbibe antibodies from mothers’ breast milk that help ward off disease while the infants’ immune systems are still developing.

Then 1 week to reach next 100,000.

If we sail through a month with limited deaths or no overflooding of hospitals, we can safely assume that we have partly found a way. I don't post memes generally but you guys deserve to see this.

Still a long way to go but still a good start People are really bursting crackers like diwali , this is unbelievable. Honestly speaking the way people are roaming around, it's as if I am over reacting by staying at home Why are people acting dumb. Essential services will still function. Most states were already in this lockdown. Many people are now believing that Corona Virus will completely go away after 21 days and people need to make a sacrifice of 21 days. Do you guys think it is wise to continue the lockdown in case the numbers dont come down considering the impact it will have on economy?

Some reporter please ask these questions instead of some factual question which you can look from ICMR website.

>**Maharashtra's Coronavirus Toll Reaches 4 After Dead Woman's Sample Tests Positive**

>Mumbai: The test report of a woman who died on March 24 turned out positive for coronavirus on Thursday, taking the COVID-19 death toll in Maharashtra to four, a health official said.

>The woman, who hailed from Navi Mumbai, had symptoms similar to the coronavirus infection. Thus, as a precautionary measure, her samples were taken and sent for testing, he said. ""The test came out positive this morning. We are now taking the necessary precautions for her relatives as well,"" the official said.

>With this, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the state has gone up to four, officials said. 

Source : https://www.news18.com/news/india/maharashtras-coronavirus-toll-reaches-4-after-dead-womans-sample-tests-positive-2551751.html Only lockdown isn’t sufficient. We need testing and medical assistance for people who are ALREADY in the quarantine, and are showing at least some signs related to Corona. I am not sure why the Govt isn’t announcing anything regarding mass-level testing. 

Golwilkar Metropolis (pvt pathology lab in Pune) has announced COVID-19 test for Rs 4500,  through sample collection from home, BUT they first need prescription from doctor and your travel history (if applicable). But no doctors, even from the big hospitals (like Naidu Hospital) are testing patients for Corona in person UNLESS they have severe symptoms / emergencies or have traveled from abroad and such. So the nonsensical ‘logic’ is that, one needs to first get (close to) infected due to such delays in testing and THEN medicos will swoop-in and likely CONFIRM that you indeed are infected?!!! I don’t understand..

Also, I am pretty sure that once the testing starts on a large scale there will be manifold increase in the number of confirmed cases. Current relatively low numbers are mostly due to lack of testing.. So, how are those widespread Holi celebrations looking now? 7 more positive in Telangana. State total now 13

(If so please point me to the source).

My questions are as follows:

1. If I exhibit Covid19 symptoms (fever/dry cough/body ache), what should be my course of action? Should I go to the local physician (risking infection to others)? Should I call the icmr helpline number of my state? (Assume I don't have travel history/ contact with a positive case)? Should I simply isolated for 14 days until symptoms subside?

2. If I exhibit respiratory distress needing hospitalization, what should I do? Local doctor or helpline??

Please point to govt website with the instructions.

Amitabh bachhan tweeted this. LMAO. Does anyone seriously believe India only has 470 cases of Corona? 

If you don't test anyone, then you won't have any infections - this govt. 

The reason we are seeing such high cases in US & Italy is because they're testing everyone. We need serious leadership here. Whats worse is I don't know if RaGa would have been any better. Why do we have such shitty leaders. Instead of strictly imposing the lockdown, this is what Delhi police is doing http://imgur.com/a/QY1CQfe Also for years India has collected an Health and Education Cess right?

[Disease modelling shows at peak 300 million would be affected by end of July.  Damn.. ](https://mobile.twitter.com/BDUTT/status/1241352659585708032) We are taking proper action right now by locking down hot zones till March 31st.  This time should be use to prepare and move assembly lines to produce test kits, masks, ventilators, protection equipment and medicine.  Its a common sense, Masks are effective against spread of droplet infections, that's why you see everybody wearing mask in china including their president.

We are country of poor people, we just can not afford to lock down everything for long time, this will result in massive job losses, recession or depression.

End the lock down at nearest possible future, Make it law to wear mask for some time and ask media + politician's to educate people to stay home as much as they can, wear masks in public, keep hygiene, go out less, stop gatherings till vaccine is out.  People will understand very fast, when they  see sick people around them.

> More than 99% of Italy’s coronavirus fatalities were people who suffered from previous medical conditions, according to a study by the country’s national health authority.

> The new study could provide insight into why Italy’s death rate, at about 8% of total infected people, is higher than in other countries.

> The Rome-based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the country’s coronavirus fatalities, finding that just three victims, or 0.8% of the total, had no previous pathology. Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions.

> More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease.

> The average age of those who’ve died from the virus in Italy is 79.5. As of March 17, 17 people under 50 had died from the disease. All of Italy’s victims under 40 have been males with serious existing medical conditions.


https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says? How likely is the virus to spread widely in India? Any credible news source with that information? So far, the numbers are low and I am (probably falsely) optimistic that it won't be such a big deal in India. With the new ban for Indian citizens from Europe, can a Indian still take a flight from US/Canada that has a connection in London or other European cities? My friend's company in Jaipur is still not giving WFH despite him being in IT.
It is very feasible to WFH

I fail to understand what they're waiting for.

What do I do? Ministry of Health and Family Welfare: Total number of confirmed #COVID19 cases in India rises to 166 - comprising 141 Indian nationals and 25 foreign nationals. There has been 3 deaths in the country due to #Coronavirus so far. (as on 19.03.2020 at 09:00 AM).
  
https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI/status/1240488023491403776 Are cases low in India or is the Government not testing enough, probably saving money, forcing people to work more days as they get infected and eventually die and then these politicians will run away Can anyone confirm if this is true?

Five foreign nationals under observation in Kochi test positive for coronavirus: Kerala minister V S Sunil Kumar All these restrictions they have placed till at least 31st march, will they extend beyond? In my opinion they should but I am not sure the government would. Those who are infected should be assured of good treatments.

https://www.deccanherald.com/amp/state/hubballi-dharwad/man-from-dharwad-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-karnataka-tally-now-at-21-816314.html I have a question on the calculation of Fatality rates.

Most articles seem to calculate fatality rate by Total\_Deaths\*100/Total\_Cases.  
My issue with this is that say a person dies on Mar 15, he must have been admitted on Mar 1. So shouldn't we calculate the fatality rate by doing Total\_Deaths\*100/Total\_cases\_on\_Mar1

Another theory is that, since a person who got the disease has two outcomes, Recovery or Death, then fatality rate would be Deaths\*100/(Deaths+Recoveries).

When I did this for Hubei Province alone, the first one was almost constant, whereas the second method started pretty high and eventually both converged as one would expect.

In Italy there is still a drastic difference in both the calculations. Guys What do you think about getting any corona virus insurance package? 

I’m from a middle/low class background and certainly cannot afford room rates of 4000rs per day and above like they are mentioning now in many reports that hospitals charge 

There is a star health corona package, but going though the terms it seems the coverage kicks in after 15 days from date of purchase

Are there any other such corona insurance policies ? Well, the next step by the government surely must be to ensure supply of food/goods (not that it's likely to be affected, but many sellers travel by local train only) and find a way to enforce strict rationing. War footing, learn from what other countries got wrong. Surely this one day lockdown has to a be trial for something bigger in coming days. I mean it would be of no use whatsoever if that's not the case. Where can I see the list of 75 districts that have been locked down? Is ghaziabad locked down.

The Kerala officials estimate he may have come in contact with about 3000 people.

Edit: False conclusion. See avniashvn96's reply below. I am unable to understand that despite the heavy media reporting on this topic and the late reaction from the government on the curfew, why do we still do not see a significant spike in coronavirus cases. Iran, US, Italy, UK, South Korea, Japan, and Spain reached a significant number of Coronavirus cases much earlier and yet countries/regions *(Myanmar, Mongolia, Russia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Hong Kong)* in proximy of China still have low number of cases. Even with low testing/reporting, I am going to assume ill people will throng hospitals which will bring attention. Is this the calm before the storm or the one after? I agree that even people in developed countries are being ignorant. But the proportion matters. Our country needs stricter rules due to high population density, high population, low literacy, low cleanliness and hygiene and less discipline and strictness in general. Also our economy is not as strong as EU & US to bear the after effects of this. Also there is little to none R&D, less medical facilities & equipments and less number of testings and labs. Then there are WhatsApp University graduates. No comments on that. 🤐 It appears a lot of people are having trouble with ""social distancing"", and even if they do stay home, they might not take the hand-washing and other procedures very seriously. It'll delay the inevitable, but probably not by a lot.

Some people have even suggested putting the economy into lower gear - banning gathering spots, reducing travel, but letting work go on as normal.

At this point I can't see if it's much worse than what it is right now. We have asked for Rs 150 Crore from centre. We have so many NRIs in Punjab, 90000 people have come here in last 3-4 months. So we need money for infrastructure as well as for isolation wards & other things if there are cases. 5 MPs also met Dr Harsh Vardhan:Punjab health minister How come Maha and Kerala have numbers three times that of the third place holder? TN +1 exams postponed. While it is a good decision, the Government shouldn't have decided to hold it in the first place. Two days back they said exams will take place as scheduled but thank god they came into senses today. Parents name their new born child ""corona"" 😭😭 why would you do that ?

> Cocking a snook at the Bihar government’s preparedness for COVID-19, as many as 83 junior doctors at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), which has been designated as the State’s first special hospital, have written to their superintendent seeking 15-day home quarantine as many of them have developed symptoms of the viral disease in the absence of protective kits and masks.

> Their petition has been forwarded to the Principal State Health Secretary Sanjay Kumar for further direction.

My company has rescinded the salary increments this year and is also taking other measures to cut down costs. I feel they are being  too aggressive. Has your company started taking such measures too?  

PS- I work in the oil and gas domain and as we know oil prices being low isn't helping the situation either. Hey guys,

How is an middle class elders supposed to survive? 2 parents stay alone in a flat and both of the, are quite old, cannot cook/wash clothes/maintain the home by themselves .. They have a cook who comes and cooks, takes care of everything around for 2 hours a day.. the cook also works at couple of other homes..

Its impossible not to come into contact with the cook who is in contact with few others from outside... Does anyone know how to get basic ration in Lucknow? Every fucking shop is closed and I might have overestimated my stock. Will run out of food in a week and a half. 
Arent shops supposed to remain open the fuck is happening? 35 y/o man died in MP cause of Coronavirus, Aajtak reported. They are also reporting 16 deaths in India. How many died today?!! 4?!

That state don't want to report any data or they don't have facility to screen patients ?

> A ten-month-old baby boy from Bantwal taluk in Dakshina Kannada has tested positive for COVID-19. The boy had no prior history of foreign travel and the bulletin stated that the family had reportedly travelled to Kerala, but Dakshina Kannada Collector Sindhu Rupesh told TNM that this was still being investigated.

> The baby was suffering from fever and severe acute respiratory illness. On March 23, he was admitted to a private hospital in Mangaluru. On March 24, the baby's throat swab was taken for testing. On March 26, the test result showed that the baby was COVID-19 positive. The child is currently stable and his close relatives are quarantined, according to the Collector.

No one is safe. what the fuck 116 cases? it was hovering around the 20s all day. Any doctor or anyone who knows the reality of hospitals,Pls Share on this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpu2zj/reality_of_hospitals/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) Can anyone tell me why the numbers are different on each site I check? As of writing this comment, here the the India death numbers on these respective sites.

Worldometer: 20 deaths
covid19india.org: 19 deaths
mohfw.gov.in: 17 deaths

I’d like to know why there’s this discrepancy in the numbers. It’d be great if someone could explain this.

Thanks!

Edit 1: Found this at the bottom of the worldometer page:


according to reports from states cited by The Times of India, as of the end of Thursday, March 27 there were 727 total cases and 20 deaths in India. The discrepancy with the official numbers (which are lower for both counts) can be explained with a lag in reporting affecting the national aggregate. We are working on implementing a tracker by state so we can independently verify the data and report it at the state level with statistics and graphs I’m a bit confused. Are the current positive cases in india included with the healthcare workers who are turning positive? [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/tata-trusts-commits-rs-500-crore-to-fight-coronavirus/articleshow/74862061.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/tata-trusts-commits-rs-500-crore-to-fight-coronavirus/articleshow/74862061.cms) We just crossed 1000 total cases. I don't know if anyone is tracking the numbers... but the migration in the aftermath of the lock down must be the largest in such a short time since the partition. **Total Case: 1003 | Deaths: 21 | Active: 898 | Recovered: 84**, as of 21:30. More on r/CoronaIndia.

\+117 so far today. IDK why this news is not talked about, it shows abject failure of the government:

> NEW DELHI: While the US Food and Drug Administration gave clearance for diagnostic tests for Covid-19 within 24 hours of application by two companies, in India a handful of compaies looking to get their tests validated have been waiting for a month, or more in some cases.

Are they waiting for JIO to apply first? 


> There seems to be no urgency on the part of the government in helping the development of indigenous capabilities.

Make in India my ass. 


Govts across the world are doing everything they can to control coronavirus. Indian govt is busy claiming gaumutr and AYUSH cures work. 

China built a 1000 seat hospital in 10 days. Indian govt is washing its bloody arse Was told by relatives that Kerala is evil, because they claimed they controlled and stopped coronavirus in the beginning, but most of the cases and spreaders came from Kerala.


They then claimed the coronavirus spreaders from Kerala were planted by the communist ruling party to subjugate and control others with the disease. Sigh.... Can we appreciate the effort the mods and u/IAmMohit have put into this thread? Individual threads for the states, links to official government sources, safety tips, tons of reading material, a Google spreadsheet and a guide to quarantining yourself. Thanks for this! Did anyone see the market crash today?? Boeing is literally on the verge of bankruptcy! Shit is about to get very very bad here. 

Things the govt should have done 2-3 weeks ago and taken a war level response to the virus:

1. stop all international flight , all people coming in mandatory 15 day quarantine 

2. Stop all trains, buses, markets etc 

3. Order all companies to either shut or provide wfh. Schools , exams all cancelled. 

4. Shut all religious shops 

Unfortunately nothing has yet been done except half measures and media management, as if such measures can contain the spread. 

We are already seeing the measures fail by Chennai covid patient travelling from UP to Chennai in train(?!) and telengana Indonesians all 6 of them also travelling in train. These have guaranteed infected atleast dozens more 

We are going to be hit by a huge wave of deaths from somewhere, and all hell will break lose. **So, lets evaluate what the government might be hiding**

~170 cases confirmed so far, but with India having the least tests per million people across the globe, lets assume the actual infected people are 100x i.e. 17,000.

At a conservative 1% death rate, we should have had 150-170 deaths so far, and the government has reported 3.

**So, have the 150 odd deaths been swept under the rug as non-covid deaths? Can our govt. fudge or hide this? We should have seen some anger from friends/relatives of such cases in social media/press if that was the case?** ICMR: 13,316 samples tested till date. 168 positive so far Call your local netas. Harass them. Harass your MLAs. Your MPs. 
Tell then you want rapid diagnostic kits available in other countries. They take 10-15 minutes, require only a drop of blood and cost 10 dollars.  
> @TheKanikakapoor returned from London to Lucknow, hid in the bathroom of airport and sneaked out without informing anyone and gave dinner party to a 100 people. Now she has been found infected with Corona Virus. She should be arrested.

Only have to blame the govt for allowing all these fucks back in. Should have shut all airports mid feb or atleast early march.

IDK why the govt even thinks its the govts responsibility to care for the 0.00005% fraction of Indian citizens who travel abroad when thousands die everyday in India out of sheer hunger. Can't find any post where Modi said ""Clapping kills coronavirus"".

I could only find that he asked to clap ""to appreciate all the hardworking doctors and other people""

Could someone please share the link and the outrage doesn't seem to stop on Jack ma while the Asia's richest man lives in india looting public money everyday I don't mind 5 minutes of people banging and clapping everyday for next one month if everyone stays the fuck home. Now that 5pm thing is over, people are out in numbers  
Modi should do a national address everyday, that might help I heard there was a party because a new govt was elected in state of MP. Seems like these guys want to go down the road to Iran Apartments in Delhi are saying that you can’t get out of the apartment without the permission of the society’s president. Is this legal? They are saying it’s Delhi police’s order Never been a fan of Modi but his aggressive steps right now are exactly what this country needs.

Hate it or love it..it did lift up my spirits in a rather depressing day reading all Coronavirus related news You know what? Modi should have said to just clap and not include those other forms like banging utensils, shankhs, etc. Would have been much better.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the 14-hour 'Janata Curfew' is the beginning of a long battle against coronavirus outbreak and the countrymen have proved that together they can defeat any challenge. ""Today's Janta Curfew may end at 9.00 pm, but this does not mean we start celebrating,"" he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1241711720998899718).He said the self-imposed curfew should ""not be considered as a success"" as it is the ""beginning of a long battle"".

Someone needs to spread this amogst people as well. Why were there absolutely no restrictions at the time of Holi, provided WHO also declared this thing a pandemic around that time?? It was mere two weeks ago.. think of all the proliferation in infections that must've occurred throughout the course of that day, which could've conveniently been avoided.. My request to all is to please do not blindly believe or follow comments on Reddit by random user or even the mods. Please refer only the official sources for any information. 

If you don't find anything on the official sources, then it means the information is not clear yet and give it some time. This thread almost feels like the DeMon thread. Never seen r/india showering so much praise on Modi except on the day DeMon was announced. Hope and expectations are high. 

Hopefully this time Modi will not disappoint us. Just watched manish sisodia on India Today. Dude literally said he's giving 100% assurance about not leaving a single person hungry on the roads and will provide shelter and food to all the migrants no matter what. Good guy Manish. Just want to share the story of my nephew (age 34) and his wife (age 28). They are in the US. They were in isolation and WFH because a COVID19 patient had visited her office some days back.

So some 6 days ago she started feeling feverish and sore throat. Some time after that she started coughing, and after that breathlessness started. Classic COVID19 symptoms. They called the hospital, and they said ""no need for test, this is confirmed COVID19, you are anyway already isolated, what is the point testing?"". They did ask for a chest X-ray to check for pneumonia. That was negative. So they prescribed medicines for the breathlessness & fever and just said ""come to the hospital if you start feeling worse"". Today she is much better and recovering. Fever is down, breathlessness gone, slight cough persists, but her appetite is good, all signs of recovery.

Even when she was symptomatic, she was able to check her emails and work a bit before my nephew yelled at her and asked her to rest. 

Seeing a lot of guys freaking out acting as if death is round the corner, so just wanted to share this story to let you guys know that this is what will most likely happen if you do catch the virus, if you are young and in decent health. Can anyone dare ask Modi what he planned for these people lining up in Delhi ? I am half afraid Modi will start passing the most controversial laws now. No peaceful protests possible. Whatever the fuck social distancing means.. we live in a 3rd world hellhole of a country and my brother works in a callcenter and if he doesn't go tomorrow to hear north americans complaining about their teeth for straight 9 hours while a coworker 30 cms away from him is coughing to death..he will be fired. 

And we are supposed to stand in the balcony and clap and sing because the dear leader expect us to. If we don't then mob is ready to stamp us anti national. 

Life in this country is fucking disgrace. No regards for human rights and welfare of the poor. I don't know why... But seeing everyone doing this retard shit makes me happy and it makes everyone happy. A little Josh in these hard times. Just went to the market in a Tier 3 South Indian town.. Fuck me, about a thousand people in a closed farmers market trying to stockpile veggies. Noped the fuck outta there.

We are not taking this seriously.. This will defo come back to bite us in the ass or lungs People got to understand that he is also taking to millions of people who follow his words like religion and have no thinking capacity of their own. He HAS to talk to them like 5 year olds, with each point overemphasised. Is this true? Deducting a day’s salary of hospital staff in Lucknow to provide them masks and other important stuff at such testing times??

Deducting salary of doctors and medical staffers? Really? 

Please clarify ASAP @UPGovt!

> Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy has warned that India could soon be dealing with a ""tsunami"" of coronavirus cases.

> He told the BBC that if the same mathematical models applied in the US or UK were applied to India, the country could be dealing with about 300 million cases, of which about four to five million could be severe. India has already implemented a series of wide-ranging measures to slow the spread of the virus.

> Official figures show the country has 149 active cases, but many public health experts worry that the country has conducted far too few tests.

Edit: Lot of misinformation is being spread. Please watch the video. This man is in India, on the ground and is an epidemiologist. He is **not** using the same parameters as US/UK, only the model. Even with the lowest assumptions, the numbers for India are staggering. He mentions that India has other risks like population density. Please pay heed to experts! 

This is the man who is in the video:

> Prof. Ramanan Laxminarayan is Vice-President for Research and Policy at the Public Health Foundation of India.  He is an economist and epidemiologist by training. His research work deals with the integration of epidemiological models of infectious diseases and drug resistance into the economic analysis of public health problems.

> He has worked extensively with the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank and other international organisations on evaluating malaria treatment policy, vaccination strategies, the economic burden of tuberculosis, and control of non-communicable diseases.

Government websites like https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ and https://icmr.nic.in are the most authentic but the UI on these sites is not as good as https://covidout.in/. 

https://covidout.in/ is also accurate in terms of numbers as it pulls data from a lot of trusted sources including the aforementioned government websites. 

https://www.covid19india.org/ updates more frequently than any other website, therefore the exact authenticity of details can't be confirmed easily. I am honestly worried about what the illiterates would do if the disease actually takes hold and affects their loved ones. I already see people abusing and disparaging Orientals and foreigners who brought the disease to India.

We are sorry we could not deliver your Milk orders today (with an exception of Bangalore customers and few hundred households in Noida). In Hyderabad, we could not deliver a single order while in Gurgaon and Noida, we could only fulfill ~40% of our orders.

Please be informed - we would NOT be able to deliver any FRESH Milk order in Gurgaon, Noida and Hyderabad tomorrow also! We request you to please arrange or skip it for a day!! We shall be able to deliver most of your other groceries.

This is after over 5 years and 30 million+ deliveries that we would not be able to deliver Milk for 2 consecutive days for most of you! We deeply regret this. But, unfortunately, we are in unnatural times. The times when, on Sunday, we delivered to all our customers before 5:30 am and then Milkbasket vendors and employees were harassed and held by authorities for ‘being on road’. The times when, on Monday, over 50+ communities (~10,000 orders) denied entry to Milkbasket - without prior notice - resulting in us dumping 15,000 liters of Milk and throwing over 10,000 kgs of fruits and vegetables!! [we could not even donate as we would otherwise]. These are also the times, where our employees and vendors are scared for their own families, their kids, their parents but still dare to come every day and every night - then being harassed/held by authorities - and then managed to deliver whatever they could to ~30,000 families this morning. And most interestingly, few but significant customers asking us to close their accounts, a few complaining to authorities that we are violating ESMA laws and a lot, and understandably, just unhappy to change the menu for their morning breakfast.

All that I can say is - we @Milkbasket take our customers very seriously. We operate at the highest levels of services - not just in India but globally! If we are not able to fulfill a promise - please be sure that there would be real, genuine reason for us to do so! We, at the same time, solicit your help for dealing with frontline authorities (any relevant contact!). I urge you to write to the local authorities on Twitter and start local petitions to help ‘essential services’ keep delivering to your homes.

We request you to have patience while all our team is working day and night to restore full Milkbasket services! If you have asked for a refund, you shall get it. If your order is billed incorrectly, it shall be rectified. If you have logged in a complaint through our Self Help - it will be attended to. For sure. No need to go in chat and repeat it. It just slows down the process. [In fact, last night at 1:00 am, I was informed that we had to shutdown our chat - which we will reopen as soon as we can]. Again, our sincere apologies for messing up your day! We are working on our best not to let it repeat. If it does, it would be something that we really could not help. 21 for places that remain at 0 cases.
42 for places that don't show new cases
Minimum 70 for places that do show growth. 

This will ensure that work gets started again and we can focus on sending help and supplies to the worst hit places.

EDIT: Be mentally prepared for this. Do not hoard. It takes time to figure out how to keep essentials running. 
If you think hoarding is necessary, let me tell you a fun scenario. I am working 12 hour shifts now, and have to drive 3 hours everyday. Add dealing with empty grocery shelves after that. Would you want doctors to stop working because their families struggle for food while you feel smug about the 100kg flour you snuck into your house? As A doctor in Germany, I was discussing with my fellow colleagues whether the measures in India are a bit exaggerated, while calling a Lockdown of 1.3 Billion for 21 days with only 500 cases and till now no documented evidence of Community spread, is a bold move. How is the medical Situation there? Or is it a politically motivated move, because I heard the economy was not doing great and now the Prime Minister can blame it on all of this. 
What is the Situation like there? It’s high time to test everyone with covid-19 symptoms (higher) than only test people identified through “contact tracing”

This will blow up any time. Cmon India, we were flexing that we have 70k test capacity per week: time to start testing Coke and Pepsi are the biggest FMCG companies with mega-reach and supply chain spread. Government should leverage their network to distribute PPE and testing kits to doctors. 27k tests is just a joke If we don't test enough during lockdown period, the numbers would explode once lockdown is lifted. Is that correct assumption?

The virus will always get you if you don’t move quickly.” Ryan added, “If you need to be right before you move, you will never win. Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management. Speed trumps perfection.

Indian police goons really need to be taught a lesson after all this is over Looking at the videos of migrant workers stranded in cities and unable to get food or transport is truly heart breaking. Lockdown was and is the right step but nobody thought of the repercussions before implementing it ? Who are the advisors of our PM ?  

The PM prides himself to be a chai wala and yet he doesn't understand the pain of the poor. ""Chaiwala"" moniker is just for when he needs votes. Not for when those poor people need help. Shambolic.  

What's worse ? Armchair experts sitting in their comfy sofas at their houses have the audacity to claim that it's these migrant workers fault and that they shouldn't be on the streets during a curfew. Well yes, if this was properly planned they wouldn't be on the streets in the first place ! In Chennai.

The Uttar Pradesh government has arranged for 1,000 buses to ferry migrant labourers who are stranded on the border districts owing to a countrywide lockdown, an official spokesman said on Saturday. ""Till late in the night, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was busy issuing instructions for arranging buses for the purpose,"" the spokesman said, adding that the CM also directed officials to arrange for food and water for such people and their families. On Saturday morning, senior police officers reached the Charbagh bus station in Lucknow to ensure that those arriving there were provided with food and water. The buses later left for Kanpur, Ballia, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Faizabad, Basti, Pratapgarh, Sultanpur, Amethi, Rae Bareli, Gonda, Etawah, Bahraich and Shravasti.

I understand the lower number of cases being reported because very few were being tasted. But the death toll should be a good indication, right? You can't ''underreport'' the number of deaths. So we're managing this pretty well for now, right?

1. Stop sending Good Morning images - text could be fine.
2. Stop forwarding Videos.
3. Don't forward huge files.
4. Don't send Corona video messages.
5. Try sending only text messages.

>In the Economic Survey, you projected that India's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at 6-6.5 percent in 2020-21. Will you still hold on to that projection which is increasingly looking optimistic as India and the world brace for the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak?

>A: See, the coronavirus is a completely unanticipated natural disaster and you know it's a period of significant uncertainty. So, I think it'll be difficult to say what will be the actual impact but my assessment is that there will be some impact for sure. In an episode like this, oftentimes the uncertainty stems from unknowns. So, putting a magnitude on the macro numbers is very difficult. For instance, FY-20 will get affected by the March numbers and at this point, my expectation is that, this should get resolved by April but, of course, we have to wait and watch. These are all expectations in a situation that is evolving.

>So, the FY 21 numbers, I think, will basically be affected by the April numbers. But to take a parallel from let's say cricket, you know in a T20 match, you can start the first over a little slower but you can accelerate later. When the bowling is tough, you should actually watch and play. So, April maybe that period. I think it's fair to say that every country is going to expect to experience the impact of the coronavirus and we will also. We cannot be an exception, correct? So, in that sense, I think there will be.

\-  [https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/doctor-at-community-clinic-in-delhis-maujpur-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-visitors-asked-to-go-on-2200746](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/doctor-at-community-clinic-in-delhis-maujpur-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-visitors-asked-to-go-on-2200746) Anybody know if the first cases reported, the college students who were evacuated from Wuhan, have now recovered? Question: What is the quarantine/isolation protocol being followed in India for someone who has been confirmed positive?

Is it:
- Self-isolation at home

OR

- Quarantine at govt. hospital

In US, those infected are asked to self-isolate at home. I am wondering if this is a safe strategy. If those people are not disciplined, wouldn't they infect others also? Even then, others living in the same house are highly likely to get infected. I guess they are using this approach because of the high no. of cases and they do not want to spare precious hospital resources on those that can recover on their own staying at home. 

What's the approach India is taking. I am not able to find anything conclusive online. Saw a police car inside my society while I went to take out my dog for a quick walk early morning. Apparently they are here to check if people are wearing masks outside in the soceity or not. Normally my soceity would never allow the police to get in unless there was a criminal issue, very eerie TOI says that 12 people have been cured in Kerala but the tracker only shows 4. Various news outlets too stated that. I can't provide the source but it'd be nice if someone could confirm. Does any one know the timeline of this? Meaning when will schools and colleges reopen, people will get back to work and all that?

- https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1243290597193994240 just read that EMI defaulters are not going to be penalised for next 3 months. is this verifiable? what about auto-debit mandates? Raining heavily on and off in Bhopal since yesterday. Freak weather for March end. This probably needs a new thread but posting here anyway


Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today allowed all financial institutions to allow a three-month moratorium for all term loans in light of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown.

In effect, banks can allow all customers to not pay their monthly EMIs for a 3-month period, and the non-repayment will not hurt their credit score.
Here are all questions on this decision answered.

Q: My EMI is due soon. Will the payment not be deducted from my account?

A: The RBI has said it has only allowed banks to extend a moratorium -- and further guidelines are awaited on whether banks will have to separately approve suspension of EMIs, either on an individual basis or at the bank level.

Q: Will non-payment result in impact on my credit score?

A: No. It will not.

Q. Which banks can offer this deferment to their customers?

A: All commercial banks (including regional rural banks, small finance banks and local area banks), co-operative banks, all-India Financial Institutions, and NBFCs (including housing finance companies and micro-finance institutions) can extend the moratorium.

Q. Is this a waiver of EMIs or a deferment of EMIs?

A: This is not a waiver, but a deferment. RBI has recommended that the repayment schedule and all subsequent due dates as also the tenor for such loans may be shifted across the board by 3 months.

Q: Does this mean that I will have to pay all 3 EMIs at one go in June?

A: Unlikely, as the RBI's statement suggests the tenor may be shifted. That is: the loan may end 3 months later than was originally slated. However, full clarity will be obtained once the RBI issues guidelines on this.

Q: Does the moratorium cover both principal and interest?

A: Yes. It does. You will be exempt from payment of your entire EMI, including payment and interest for three months. This will be applicable on all loans outstanding as on March 1, 2020.
Q. What kind of loans does the moratorium cover?

A: The RBI policy statement explicitly mentions term loans, which includes home loans, personal loans, education loans, auto  and any loans which have a fixed tenure. The also include consumer durable loans, such as EMIs on mobiles, fridge, TV etc

Q: Does the moratorium cover credit card payments?

A: Since credit cards are defined as revolving credit and not term loans, they are not covered under the moratorium.

Q: Does the moratorium cover loans taken on credit cards?

A: As of this point, it is unclear whether they will be covered. The RBI's guidelines are expected to provide clarity on this.

Q: I have taken a project loan for setting up a factory. Can I not pay my EMI?

A: The moratorium has been allowed on all loans classified as term loans. To get further clarity on this, you may have to contact your bank.

Q: What has the RBI announced for businesses?

A: The RBI has allowed deferment for interest payments for all working capital loans taken by businesses. This will be applicable in respect of all working capital facilities outstanding as on March 1, 2020. The accumulated interest for the period will be paid after the expiry of the deferment period. Moratorium/deferment will not be treated as change in terms and conditions of loan agreements and will not result in asset classification downgrade.

Our useless criminals and rapists elected to power by illiterate mobs have ensured ruin of India. 

Congrats sanghis and chaddie clad bhaktas, I guess . Keep voting for religion over issues that matter Lol.. they are showing Yogi adyanath thanking the doctors... Didn't his government send a doctor to jail falsely accusing him of negligence? I wonder what that doctor makes of this... I appreciate all the clapping and thali bajana for our doctors but i can't unsee the fact that our Govt hs been utterly careless about the virus...With poor health infrastructure and huge population,they should hv acted and started testing in mass much earlier but instead they let it spread... Infact, they are still not testing at mass level and with labours going back to their home in Bihar from all over the country and  with Bihar and UP having such a huge population and just 1 and 2 testing centers respectively in the entire state,figure out what's gonna happen. Lol Im now banned in the so called ""free speech"" chaddi subs for telling them how Ghobi jee is squarely to blame for lakhs jumping in joy on the streets after 5 PM yesterday. Chaddis have very little emotional quotient and even less tolerance for logic and facts Yeah, sorry, this has simply become a disaster when it comes to availability of goods. Lockdown is going to fail utterly unless the government does a much, _much_ better job ensuring essential goods are actually _available_. Why are police going and shutting down small stores thus ensuring larger crowds at big grocery stores? And then if even those big grocery stores get shut down, people are going to then travel more and more to search for what they need.

I can only hope this kind of shit gets fixed ASAP. It's the need of the hour. Declaring early lockdowns was a great move, but it needs to be _doable_ for people to stay home. You can't go out ""infrequently"" for essential goods if you can't find most of the things you need most of the time. While I was running around trying to get groceries on Saturday, my flatmates were out in the streets taking selfies with their girlfriends. I kept warning them, urging them to help but they were like chill bro. Didn't even bother stocking up. They can't cook, they can't clean dishes, they are all papa ki pari (guys).


And now I'll be the asshole if I refuse to share my supplies with them, essentially cutting my supply from 1 week to 3 days. They didn't even get a packet of Maggi. PM told not to hoard, but he never said don't even stock up a week. Idiots will kill us all. Police beating up 100s of people who have congregated in a mosque in Gokak, Karnataka.

They need to realize that lockdowns will be common for quite a while now and they have to endure this for a long time. Now a curfew till April 4 pleeeease.

Fully open and barely any crowd.


Don’t rush to the market today. You are only adding to the already panic induced crowd and increase your chance of catching the virus.

Let couple of days go . Everything will settle and Grocery and essential items will be available as usual. Most of them are perishable items so can’t /won’t be hoarded.

You are educated . Just understand the situation logically and don’t panic So I was talking to my friend in Barcelona and he said the healthcare system is nearing a collapse. If the low numbers in India are due to lack of testing as many claim here, why aren't our limited hospital facilities overcrowded with suspected patients yet? Also, there is no surge of deaths yet, thankfully.

There are more ways to assess the prevalence of the virus in our population than testing. I dont see any news that Ibdia is ramping up testing.. 

My **city** has [released a list of 19000 people suspected to be carrying corona](https://karunadu.karnataka.gov.in/hfw/kannada/homequarantivedocs/Bengaluru.xls) (they travelled from abroad, or came into contact).. yet the whole **State itself** has done only 2000 tests per day

IDK what they are waiting for, now its lock down and there is no sign any increase in rate of tests conducted.. A couple questions

1. Is there a possibility that the virus situation won’t be as bad as predicted in India?

2. Is there a chance of the lockdown being extended even after April 14? [This](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other) is an extremely long read, but a great one to understand the race to make the coronavirus vaccine and why its so difficult Authorities are wasting time doing only contact tracing of international travelers..We should be focused on testing people visiting clinics for cold and cough  and provide PPE to all such doctors. >M Venkaiah Naidu, Ravi Shankar Prasad Donate One-Month Salary In Fight Against COVID-19

Dear Modi... the people wont forget this ... I may get downvoted for this but if we look at the other side, the number of recovered cases are also rising every day. Today at 5 PM - Keep up the drum beat: Where are the tests. Where are the tests? Where. Are. The. Tests?? WHERE ARE THE TESTS!!!!!!!?????? It's the biggest flaw that private medical practitioners are allowed to charge Rs. 4500 for covid testing. Are you fucking kidding me?

Not only has yes bank failed but with Supreme court order on Vodafone AGR dues, this is likely to cause over 20,000 crore of NPAs on top banks, including SBI and IndusInd. It wont be surprising to see another bank fail and get saved by cashpayers money.

Moreover Vodafone a large international company failing due to GOI greed will be death knell of foreign investments into India. Imagine a govt so careless they allow such a large company such as vodafone to go bankrupt due to utter stupid policies. This govt has managed to destroy one of the most promising sectors telecom into a duopoly. 


Even liquid funds are crashing hard as even GOI defaulting cannot be ruled out at this point. Lot of RBI money has gone into cleaning up the mess created by DeMo, GST, saving private banks, etc. While other countries are announcing several billion dollars of corona relief, there is nothing really left in terms of relief to Indian citizens.

Is there a factual counter for it? I know it's fake but I need people to shut up. SENSEX crashed almost 10% made a quick trip to nearby stores most were closed so no luck. can stretch my stock for another 3 days. hope it doesn't become a case of good intention (lockdown) with bad implementation. 21 day lockdown. huge ! if we come out of this, resurrecting the economy will be a huge huge task. so how does the government expect the poor who live paycheck to paycheck to live without a salary for 3 weeks? **I want to call on all problem solvers on reddit and understand what real world problems, that are a result of this pandemic + lock downs, can we as citizens of our nation can help solve so that the we help each other in these extraordinarily tough times.**

The situation is going to get worse even with our country going into lock down - it is fact we all have to accept as early as possible. There are a lot of unique problems the combination of a pandemic and a lock down would bring to the people of our country - especially the poor and uneducated, the daily wage workers, elderly people etc. I can't even wrap my head around what all of those could be.

What are some widespread affects of this global situation could create in our country and how can these problems be solved? How can we, as people who might be relatively well off in this pandemic than other, help solve these day to day problems to ease the affects of all these drastic changes.

I do not want to lose this opportunity to help other people. I myself do not have the intelligence to detect 'problems that can be solved' that don't already have some solutions like grocery deliveries, etc. But I am capable of helping a community of people who are trying to solve the problems. If we can do even a little bit to ease the way daily life works for other people in these times, we should do it coming together to solve these problems..

I even have a problem framing questions, so please forgive me for being too descriptive. Please guide me if there are already some threads on reddit about similar thinking about problems + solutions brainstorming that apply to the current global situation. WTF is modi saying right now? Don't you think India's cases will be more than just 664? If not detected yet and they are leading to local transmission.

> Other researchers studying why children don’t seem to get that sick from Covid-19 have pointed out the corollary: Kids tend to have “pristine” lungs that have not already been damaged by a lifetime of inflammation caused by allergies, pollutants, and diseases. This might make them more resistant to attack by the new virus.

(This seems to be just a theory, but is kind of borne out by observations.)

Now apply this theory to the fact that [21 of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/25/health/most-polluted-cities-india-pakistan-intl-hnk/index.html)

Even if he is copying, why can't he copy the good stuff? I don't think that the situation will be as bad as some of you guys think. It will be bad, but not as bad.

Why?

New studies are coming out which show a very high R0 and an IFR of about 0.18%. 

Heat will not destroy the virus (idiots) but it will slow the transmission down. 

Obviously the rate will keep spiking for a few days because of the low testing early on. Holy shit what will i eat in these 21 days?

Shops are closed.... People actually listen to this guy. Very good that he himself is announcing this 88 new cases today according to MOHFW. Largest increase in cases in one day so far.

I compiled this using a bunch of sources online. I'll list them at the end. Feel free to add to it.

Why do I think this ratio is important? Well, out gives you a fair idea as to how countries are testing people. If the ratio is high, then the county is testing more for people who are quite sick already. 

I did this because I thought India's ratio will be much higher than the other's. I'm (pleasantly?) surprised by the result. Maybe, just maybe, we aren't in that bad a shape after all.

It occurred to me that apartment blocks are going to get hit particularly hard in India. Why? Maids. Everybody has them, and the nature of the maids' work is such that they come in contact with objects in the home, and social distance is  often a problem. And the same maid goes to multiple apartments in the block. And at the end of the day, all these maids go back home where they mingle with ... other maids.

This is a recipe for disaster. If you hire maids, maybe you should consider stopping them for the duration of this crisis (but be good and pay them their entire salaries). If that's a problem, how about asking them to wear masks and make sure they do the entire proper handwashing routine before and after they are done at your home.

NYT: [Lost Sense of Smell May Be Peculiar Clue to Coronavirus Infection
](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html) During a pandemic react like [Singapore](https://theprint.in/world/why-singapore-isnt-in-a-coronavirus-lockdown-as-told-by-a-doctor-of-the-country/384784/) and not like [India](https://twitter.com/srivatsayb/status/1242093677763121152?s=09) Someone told me that plasma extracted from recovered patients helps treating Covid-19 in ill patients. China did it. Is this a fact? Guys I have a question. Assuming the lockdown does work and cases decline, and everyone goes back to business as usual on April 1st, won't the cases rise again since the lockdown is over with people mingling with each other? For how long can you realistically keep a population as large as ours confined? [This](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/23/asia/hong-kong-coronavirus-quarantine-intl-hnk/index.html&ved=2ahUKEwi2mMWrqLLoAhUKxzgGHcITCkEQFjAHegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw3KpDEEuF_Hl5zEtBg3U47s&ampcf=1) link shows how Hong Kong made the same mistake by lifting restrictions too soon. Does this mean we're looking at these lockdown like situations for maybe the next few months? **Quick self-quarantine question**: If I am an asymptomatic carrier, can I spread the virus from mere breathing? 

About 5 days ago, I had to take a domestic train journey from Delhi to my hometown where I was packed with around 70 other passengers. I took a hot shower after I got home, disinfected my luggage with boiling water, wiped my phone and wallet with sanitizer. Although I was in an AC coach and every single person in the coach was wearing a mask (including me), I am not ruling out the possibility of me having contracted the virus.

I self quarantined inside my home, on the second floor while my family lives on the first. It is the 6th day now and I am considering coming out of quarantine. I have no symptoms.

Assuming I am an asymptomatic carrier, is it possible that I might be exhaling the virus as a course of my normal respiration? As in, I breathe in, and when I breathe out the air contains viruses from my lungs?


Does anyone know if there is a doctor I can email with this question? I really need to know since my non participation in the household is causing some serious family issues. So is anybody else familiar with the scam currently underway on the Private labs sourcing test kits from an Ahmadabad based shady company whose parent US company is basically a shell but has an FDA approval?

Saket Gokhale has done an RTI over this. Crazy if true! Guys, groceries and essentials are too local for the central to make a statement on. I'm not a bhakth, but hear me out. I think the state govt should be the one making the necessary arrangements for this. In telangana, the govt declared that essential shops will be open, and that you are allowed to eat anything necessary till 6pm. And also, people who hike prices are going to be severely punished. So, be calm and think with a calm head. We got this. Immediately after announcimg lockdown he should have said do not panic, essential services and items will always be available. People wouldn't be panic shopping so much. Now people will hoard most stuff and essential items will get scarce for the rest. WHAT A MASSIVE FUCK UP. [deleted] Chief municipal officer ordered the shops be opened on alternate days from 8 to 11 am. Just bought 3k worth of groceries and it feels like a victory.

WHO is a CCP puppet. When China was in lockdown in late January, WHO suggested NOT to ban flights from China. Some countries followed it, some ignored and imposed travel ban anyway. India was one of the first country to travel ban despite WHO suggestions, which resulted in very calm February. Despite the exponentially increasing cases in the world and local clusters in many countries across different continents, WHO refused to call the disease a pandemic until the world didn't cared for it anymore.

* The government, now having tasted blood, will be heavyhanded more than ever

* China having got through this relatively unscatched will be an economic bully, gaining strides over Europe and US.

Oh my, a politician that actually listens and plans accordingly. Now ain't that a surprise! Be prepared for Ghanta Curfew on Sunday Cringe se marr raha hun bc I am sure that the government in India know fuck all about managing economic and social disasters like this. They should make a move like the dutch PM and use competent people from the opposition to combat the situation

But then again I am speaking about a govt that essentially laid off  Raghuram Rajan to makes shit moves like Demonetisation. So I kmow this wont happen Are we using any serological tests such as [this one](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/biomerica-begins-shipping-samples-of-10-minute-test-for-covid-19-virus-exposure-/) or planning to use them in the near future? Anything about that?

Serological tests are highly useful because it lets us know who is immune to the virus also, and the more we are hearing of asymptomatic carriers the more important it becomes. I'm wondering if it's okay to go out for run/jogging in the morning when there'll be less people on the road/park?

The implications of this are very scary in the short term. It means that we really need a strict lockdown or we will still face the same thing that Wuhan, Italy and NYC etc have faced/are facing. It is just a lot more hopeful in the long term.

I can't wait for serological testing to really let us know about this. I think South Korea has started it and UK will start in two weeks. Seems an eternity at this time but just who can say. >FM Sitharaman eases regulatory, tax compliance burden amid Covid-19

Heres to the hope that the politicians of India will someday be worth something

Edit: Evidently people think I have a problem with the speech itself. Thats not the case.

And people were defending Smriti Irani when she was appointed the HRD minister. 15 districts in UP are locked down for the next three days. Does anyone know if these new cases popping up are community transmission cases or people with travel history?

Any stats on how many of almost 400 cases are people with foreign travel history and their relatives? Dumb question, what does the tracker mean by ""Hospitalized"". More into what treatment are they getting? Is it IV? Is it intubation? Since trains are down, all markets in WB are hit. Supplies are low because most sellers come via trains. Cost of transportation by truck for these vendors is too much so they aren't coming.

So ya, markets may be but supply is very little. Ccp fudging numbers?

That is way worse than limiting them to their houses. The JHU study projects atleast 11 million hospitalizations in India at a single point. Which means that millions will die.

Only stepped out of the house to go grocery shopping once and to collect beer which was left out on the driveway by the uber eats guy. Seeing the news coming in from India is really concerning. The lack apathy shown will cost tens of thousands of lives. That sudden urge to go out, go back home, fly back fly out is universal. Why can't people outside country stay there like they used to, chances are 100% they won't get the virus if they stay there and not fuckin fly back home and infected all. Its not even like they are kicked out from that country. Stupidity has no cure. Bc atleast tell us about groceries and announce free ration for the poor. We are watching-

Literally whole day's effort got wasted because Ghobijee living in his sab changa sii bubble still doesnt understand the common man of the country. 

Lakhs would have gotten infected yesterday because instead of just a curfew, ghobi jee wanted it to end in a self chest thumping party Punjab police is beating the shit out of people who are roaming outside.

Just saw it on ABP news What I expect PM to talk about?

1. Assuring economy by introducing some wiser bailouts and relifes. 
2. Assuring and mandating supply chains intact and make it mandatory to keep grocery and vegetable stores open with precautionary measures of limits on how much people can buy and number of people that can be in a store at a given time based on area of the store. 
3. Assuring everything is normal. Educating Police not to beat people who are on their vehicles. If a person is on his vehicle, he is maintaining a social distance. Educate the idiotic police. In the amidst of this, might be a selfish question but I am really woried about my placements that is starting next semester, from july. This will definitely ger affected, but to what extent?

Phew. 8/10 speech. Should have addressed steps taken to ensure essential supplies last and how he’ll help poor people. Otherwise a very good speech and much needed steps taken Seeing what happened after 5 PM today, I am seriously questioning if India as a country is even capable of the lockdown and measures required. Economic Package coming tonight at 8 pm boys.

Kaka wants attention. Can we get another thread for today's modi speech! I feel like killing myself listening to him but a thread and co reddit peeps help me go through it ;) You know what would've helped? Suspension of all international incoming flights since 31st Jan. But the rich NRIs here will kill you for saying that. Guess what, these rich fuckers have killed millions now. This blood is on your hands. Why is each govt beating its chest on ""number of passengers screened""? This stat is absolutely useless. The govt had one job - to stop flights as early as possible, which they failed miserably and allowed all the infected people to get in without as much as a cursory check.

Now after all the flights are closed, each state is thumping its chest on ""no of passengers screened"" stat, showing lakhs in figures... who are they trying to fool? 

Screening passengers is also useless, many infected people dont have any symptoms and even people with symptoms are having a paracetamol and pass through the screening with normal temp.. what a joke. One of my friend in a government hospital was saying that they are suppressing numbers of covid patients in the hospital. Even the patients are being threatened of not being provided any treatment if they come out and blow the whistle.

Same situation as it is happening in Delhi bus stand .

Pretty sure almost all states are having similar situations or delays with similar situations in the past week.

It’s not surprising. Migrant workers want to return home once their factories closed . No one wants to stay in play without money and hoping for fee food from somewhere .They want to get back to their homes where atleast they would have ration cards and then hunker down to see if the lock down .

Only reason it’s getting this sub freaked out is because it’s happening in Delhi and as such English media is reporting it which is where Reddit gets it info.

[Source](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/coronavirus-pandemic-400-million-indians-to-be-infected-by-july-report-suggests-start-of-community-transmission-5079281.html)  **Contrary to the government's stance, the report noted that community transmission (Stage-3) of COVID-19 in India most likely started in early March.**

In the next months, as many as 100 million people in India are likely to contract the coronavirus infection, a report by Johns Hopkins University and Center for Diseases Dynamics, Economic and Policy (CDDEP) suggests. These numbers are expected to soar to around 300 million to 400 million by July, without interventions.

Now ,  I know many state governments have announced relief measures and central government is going to continue MGNREGA , but we all know the track record of the governments with their welfare schemes , especially in such a short time period .


* There is also a significant population of India who have been at the receiving end of this government's discriminatory policies . Many of them have 0 trust in the government ( I am not making a moral judgement ,I am just stating a fact ) . 



* The government's track record with previous such moves hasn't been really good . Demonetization was a train wreck . Article 370 was similarly a train wreck . GST was a disaster despite years of preparation  . Now we are supposed to believe that the various government will effectively pull off all necessary arrangements for this lockdown in a matter of few days ?


* 21 days of lockdown won't defeat coronavirus . It will return with a vengeance . The only way of dealing with it is mass societal awareness and changing our behaviour permanently .

Wasn't this support to be ""our"" curfew and not one imposed by the administration? Just got sent some videos on Whatsapp about police in Pune beating youth that are out on the streets. 

As much as I’m in favour of the Janta Curfew, this is supposed to be a voluntary movement after all. Abuse of power like this is totally uncalled for. From the coronavirus sub. Impressive shit from the Chinese.

A lot of Americans say the Chinese are lying. Maybe.

I live in China. My city entered lockdown in the first week of February, and is slowly opening up again. That's two months of lockdown, not two weeks. Bars and restaurants are open as of last week. Schools may open on April 8th. Many non-essential businesses, such as house salesmen, dry cleaners, etc are starting to open as well. You also record where you enter on a phone app for contact tracing. Literally everywhere - 7-11, sign in, the grocery store, sign in, getting on a subway, sign in, leaving a subway, sign in. My neighbor got a phone call in the middle of February telling her she had shared a metro car with a positive ID coronovirus patient on Tuesday at 3-3.30pm and that police would be coming by her house to ensure she stayed in a mandatory 2 week quarantine. They were there every day.

You have to stay in the city you're registered - my girlfriend is registered in a city about an hour from me, and she signed in an app she had registered in my city. She received a police phone call and visit asking her why she wasn't in her local city, that same day, and why her sim card had pinged as my city. She had to provide a copy of her GPS data to avoid forced quarantine.

Temperatures are taken at every business and community before you enter. If you have a fever, the business owner or security guard hold you for half an hour and take a test again. If you still have a fever you are immediately sent to a fever clinic and a 3 week quarantine under forced observation - this happened to a friend of mine.

People outside your apartment complex are not allowed in. No outside visitors unless their name is on the lease. My friends can't come to a dinner party, my cleaner can't come to her job, if the internet goes out I have to register a complaint with my apartment management, and they'll organize a date for repair - I'm not allowed to do it myself. I can come and go as I please, but I'm lucky. If there were a confirmed case in my apartment complex, the police would probably enforce a 14 day quarantine on all inhabitants.

Everyone entering the country from abroad has a mandatory 3 week quarantine at a military camp or hotel, and they cover their own expenses.

You can't trust the Chinese government's numbers, but they're also not pussyfooting around like the West. If any country is fighting this thing, its China. Freedom isn't free - China can do this because they're authoritarian and people's rights can be suspended at the whim of the government ""for the public good"". But its effective for pandemics. New York testing 500k people/day.. Why aren't we doing more tests? 26k isn't enough for a country with 1.3b billion people. For all we know, thousands may already be infected but asymptomatic. I see a lot of people in my town having dry coughs.. I'm scared af Coronavirus: US announces additional financial aid worth USD 174 million to 64 countries, including USD 2.9 million to India

https://twitter.com/PTI_News/status/1243660047512551424?s=19

..why waste that 2.9 million, its gonna go to the corrupt govt coffers or their IT cell anyway A whatsapp unkill sent me a video saying corona victim cant hold breath for more than 10-20 secs. Normally we can hold breath for 40-50 secs. True? # WE KILLED CORONA GUYS.

# MUDIJI IS GENIUS. Abhi se chalu bajana. India has proved that we’re full of Idiots.

Jai Hind 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 the number of cases has been on 402 for a few hours now. Is the worst over? I'm being told that people who claim India isn't testing enough people are stupid because India has tested as many people as Austria, but has much less cases than Austria.

. Is that a right comparison? They also priced provided source What the hell is with these Darwin Award nominee comments? Yes I get that natural selection will leave them behind but it’s a pointless comment not understood by these very nominees and only understood by us reddit edgelords.

Some aunties are crying and shouting Modi's name.  


I am super scared actually! Wow! No comment on how we will get the essentials. Don’t expect much from him anyway. Hey guys, I have a strong feeling that India is not going to see too many Corona cases as other countries. I stay oversees and I was watching how the governments were handling this crisis in different countries. I see that Indian government (both central and state governments) did a wonderful job in containing the disease before it starts spreading in community. There were strict on contact tracing and did tireless job. Since, the actions were taken early on, I don't feel that there will be too many cases in future. Now, this 21 days lock down will tremendously help stop the community spread as well. I agree that 5PM banging and people flocking to go to their hometowns were a big blunder. But, apart from that, I guess you all should be fine. What do you guys feel?

Be safe. just a reminder [this](https://twitter.com/satyaveerarora/status/1241747049239937024?s=21) is what our country was upto on 5pm Janta Curfew Corona Virus on surfaces is less likely to get people sick after few hours.

Any innovative idea that comes by is quickly acknowledged.](https://mobile.twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1241405077580963841) One thing, even if someone discovers the vaccine today, the vaccine itself will not come into market before June 2021. Vaccine regulations are one of the most stringent regulations in the planet. Its going to take months for it to cross regulatory tests. doesnt seem like other state CMs are doing anything other than Delhi,kerala,chattishgarh,odisha Death by cringe [deleted] there is a reason why the spread of the virus in india has been slow and delayed. This is a reason that many Indians are loathe to acknowledge: India is not a significant part of the global economy. It is a bit player at best. Most of india's economy is driven by internal consumption, not outside supply.

The ""slow"" spread has little to do with government action. The indian government is mostly incompetent and selfish while the health authorities are hobbled by a lack or resources and a stubborn, ignorant population. The virus has spread beyond anyone's control and in a densely populated country, nothing can be done.

The section of india's population that *is* part of the global economy is about 20-30 million people at best and it is these people who are disproportionately affected at this early stage of the virus' spread. Also, the bulk of indian emigrants are piss poor labourers. The white collar folks are a minority and many of then aim to cast off the yoke of India altogether. These people are likely the vectors of the initial spread from the west and once the virus reached the Arabian Gulf, the poor labourers become the vectors.

Mark my words, India is going to be ravaged by this virus and the ship that was already sinking will fall apart quickly. The health authorities have already surrendered as they are not stupid. They know what is coming and they realise that testing 20 out of a million people isn't going to do shit.

Come back in a month and we'll see how accurate my statements were. Till then, adios mitron. Sit tight, it's going to be a rough ride for all shithole countries, India included.

You want to beat this thing, you have to impose strict measures like in my country but most importantly you have to be disciplined. Everybody by law has to wear a face mask to start with. Whole cities have been quarantined where most cases were reported. Basically people are not allowed to go out in those cities at all.
There's a prediction up to 300 000 000 people in India could get infected. At 4 percent death rate your services will collapse leading to even more deaths.
Your first step has to be to start wearing face masks when going out. Not to protect yourself but to stop it spreading it further. Please keep us updated on the ground realities of the Lockdown in this thread.

#THIS WILL FUCKING DESTROY INDIA, PLEASE MORE TESTS NEEDED Man, he speaks like he is explaining this to school children. Baccha samajhata hai sabako. Yes, bhakts have brains of school kids but not the entire country. I think despite all measures (or in absence of thereof), CoVID-19 will all hell break loose in the world and gonna wipe out a huge population(it already has depending on what one terms as huge). The disease is so infectious that even a single case is enough to start a worldwide pandemic and since its asymptomatic in many cases, its practically impossible to eradicate it completely. Even if a vaccine gets developed in (not so) near future, its practically impossible to vaccinate each and every individual in this world (imagine the rush). So, the world will get divided into two groups ( much similar to blood groups) Covid-19 positive meaning who are sufficiently immune towards CoVID-19 and Covid-19 negative meaning who are not. The Covid-19 negative group will either be vaccinated for acquired immunity or be obliterated by the virus so that the world will only be left with Covid-19 positives. And since then, the disease will become unimportant like seasonal flu. Only, the survivors will be saying, "" I am having a bad Covid"" instead of  ""I am having a bad flu"" Few days ago I dropped a 200/- note on the road and picked it up , put it back in my pocket.

As soon as I did it I realised how fucking stupid it was.
Is it possible to get infected like this?Can the virus reside on a surface for long? Governance of the Memes, by the Memes, for the Memes. As I worried, a poor administrator like Modi was the last thing we wanted in such a crisis.

UK, Italy, USA and others ensured that there were enough necessities for them to survive if they go into a complete lockdown. They made sure that no panic should arise.

But why did Indian Government decide to do lockdown for such a huge country for such a long time without ensuring any availability of enough ration, food and water. What are they thinking? Do they want people to die of starvation?

I don't know what's going to happen.

Wtf [deleted] Neend uchkadi yaar here's why i cant tell people not to hoard food and other stuffs. 

Unlike other countries, even essential food and utility deliveries like trucks are dwindling down in India. 
If you see r/all there is a picture posted by a trucker in Canada about how he is still braving snowy filled roads to deliver logs for toilet paper manufacturing.

Indian truckers dont care.

In the coming days India will bet he only country where there will be an artificial shortage of food and essential supplies. Only because truckers here dont give a fuck. 

Maybe it is a good idea to hoard food before lockdown comes. I dont know. It feels wrong but people gotta eat.

All though i expect this situation to last for atleast 2-3 months. It doesnt look like the virus is spreading in India. Luckily Guys please don't panic like crazy. Despite its high mortality rate, you are VERY UNLIKELY TO DIE if you don't have any underlying health issues.

South Korea has been the leader of testing and treatments.

It's death rate is 0.9%.

Remember high death rates mean death in the total number of TESTED PEOPLE. Are we overreacting to the coronavirus ? Just need to ensure that people with a history of foreign travel in March are tracked and quarantined.

I love to cook and experiment, but the daily grind ensures that 90% of the time I end up eating out or ordering takeaways.  Sounds like a good idea to me. I'd definitely use it and would be willing to pay a little extra, just don't make a fool of customers with exorbitant airport like prices for tiny portions. Absolute hygiene is my number 1 priority. Glove, cap and sterilize the shit out of everything possible. And dont just say it.Give us proof. Get external agenices to audit the hygiene(if such agencies exist) and also post thorough Hygiene standards and rules so that we can hold you accountable. Put uo youtube videos of kitchen tours. Ok now lets come to nutriton. Obviously do your research and make everything healthy but also add an Organic tier. The Organic variety should have the main things like chcken and milk sourced orgamically, i.e., without pesticides or hormones etc. And lastly money. You guys need to make the least possible profit that fits your model or else this system fails. And Also reach out to cities where similar services dont exist yet(cover all the metros to begin with). Thats about it :) Honestly I guess you guys are already done with all the planning and investing phase and are going to launch soon so whats done is done, but still one can hope, can he not Done. FYI there is an app on Google play store called ""Fofi"" which does the same. Restricted to Chennai though. Like Tinmen?  Where is your would be startup based?  How is this different from eat. fit or half a dozen 'health food' restaurants listed on swiggy right now?

I was witness to the great ""food tech"" boom of 2014, couple of which promised calorie counted, nutrition counted, healthy meals. None of them survived. Why not become an aggregator for homechefs? There are quite a few home run catering services and mom's who cook everyday for their family, if they have an extra meal which might be wasted or forcefully eaten, you can use it and just need to take care of packaging and delivery. Homemade meal averages out to Rs 30 per meal (3 rotis, daal and one veg), you can buy it for 50 and then sell it with packaging and delivery for a nominal profit and at the same time get mom's in to the gig economy.  All the best, OP. Check out [Food darzee](https://www.fooddarzee.com/) if you haven't already. They pretty much do the same. A suggestion: Give detailed nutritional detail for each meal plan, to be viewed upon button click or something. And maintain the quality and taste of food while meeting the nutritional detail exactly.  Box8 also did this, cooking food and delivering it, but I doubt they couldn't run this long. Also, any type of delivery business is the worst idea.

Edit - in Mumbai, some restaurant also does it on personal portal like hellogreen.in Eat.fit-Cult is already there I am a budget user. If i get healthy meals at 50 - 70. I will be more than happy. 

* Curefit is very costly. Suppose each meal cost around 150. So for 25 days it comes around as 3750. Which is 25% of 15000 rupees.
* 15000 rupees is standard salary of freshers, BPO people who are in large numbers. So curefir meals constitute 25% of salary,
* If you bring the cost to 1/3 rd  of 3750 i.e 1250 will be glad to buy it. definitely an untapped and good idea in india! try to include more of local stuff unlike ichef. also follow try following blue apron's business model as something on the side for cheaper prices. i definitely see potential in mumbai.  actually sounds like a good idea.  Definitely sounds like a good idea for big cities. Cult fitness in bangalore already does it and it looks popular- at least from zomato reviews.

My only request would be eco friendly/bio-degradable packaging, if you are moving forward with the idea.  another one? I used one app, TinMen which does exactly this. Check the food subscriptions here in US, you may be inspired. Subscriptions here send portioned out meal kits to make your own food, this works because you don't need to do any shopping or measure quantities. There's a spice only subscription too. You mean [eat.fit](https://eat.fit) version 2.0 ? Gym diet please! I can't make chicken at home will eat outside if there's a tiffin app  The market is already saturated with similar services. Since you are entering a crowded space, your customer acquisition costs for the first 2 years are going to be very high.

Inspite of all the odds , the Indian consumer is moving towards healthy and organic food and there is still a huge market for it, if your able to offer something unique to consumers, you will succeed. I personally would love a good app based tiffin service, I have tried some, but the food becomes too routine after some time and doesn't feel worth the exlenditure anymore. So my suggestion would be to try and make the menu have some surprise elements, so that every meal feels different. Also, I don't know if it's logistically possible, but customizable amount of spices would be a great feature for a tiffin service. That said, all the best OP. I'm going to ask you the same questions I anyone when they talk about their idea.

* The product (what is it, use case, who would want it)
* The market (TAM, size, competition, dynamics to be aware of)
* Product analysis / comparison against competition
* What stage are you in? Do you need money? Are you raising?
* Customer conversion strategy (where do you find them, and how do you make them buy  from you?)
* Why you? Why are YOU the best person for this job? (experience? good team? rich daddy who can't bring himself to pull the plug? what?)
* Have you thought differently about this idea differently? what are you offering that's different from others in the same market? Better business plan would be to import Huel.com from UK and sell it in India on Amazon. Like Swiggy?",2019-03-19 18:55:44
AskIndia,[AskIndia] Can Dawood Ibrahim be a Free Man as per current state of Indian Judiciary?,10,dic1m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dic1m6/askindia_can_dawood_ibrahim_be_a_free_man_as_per/,1,"
Before anybody comments shit instead of discussion, 

A) I'm a 5th Generation Maharashtrian (that I know of) and 3rd Generation Mumbaikar aged 41. So obviously I'm not a Muslim or a Pakistani posting here. Its sad that it has come down to this that one has to prove his Nationalism for any freeminded discussion. We all let it happen, it's our fault not of Bhakts.

B) Not a Dalit but a Chitpavan Brahmanvad, so I can claim My Hinduism to any Hindutva turd and tell them to back the fuck off, in real world. I'll show my clout and power to those, if and when need arises. Because that's not relevant here and i'm just clearing this for stupid and ignorant Bhakts.

Now, since that part is cleared, I definitely am not a supporter or a fan of Dawood or his chain of gangsters ever. Dawood was just a name whom every gangster wannabe wanted to have that kind of power that he had in his time of late 80s and 90s. Everyone as a kid used to mock himself as Bhai or Dawood gang leader just for fun. That was the kind of cult Dawood had in his prime, the mumbai underworld king. Look at any big international gangsters stories and Dawood was no different. From actors to politicians, businessmen and builders, Gold and Diamond merchants and every small or big scale citizens of India was affiliated with Dawood once directly or indirectly. During that period, only the Law enforcement and Cops gave actual shit to pin his empire down and common citizens never gave a fuck about it, like how the common people are doing now but it is pointless since he is overseas or Pakistan or wherever he can easily travel.

I'm positive that he had hands on Mumbai serial blasts, everybody thinks that because some cops were sure of it based on tips and infos. But that's that. Finito. No hard evidence to back up the cops theory cuz it's obvious he didn't plant those bombs himself. His minions did. And those minions of his used some 3rd party to do the dirty work, similar to lower class poor needy should shitbag. So one cannot even prove that it links to Dawood based on hard evidence. There is none. It's only a feeling that we think Dawood did it. No matter how much We as citizens believe that he did it, our Judiciary will still not be convinced and will let him go Scott free. Because it happened 25 years ago. Ofcourse Dawood will not come down and will confess, not will his supporters or even his enemies will do it too. Because even his enemies hates cops and law and order. A common ground between every rival gangster is that to keep cops at Bay. So nobody will ever come out and will be a witness. Chotta Rajan? Hahaha....he was once a part of Dawood gang, so whatever he will claim will come down to him as well. To be honest, he is no good use to the courts as he himself is a criminal with so many cases against him.

Ofcourse he has knowledge of Dawood a whereabouts, but how much really does he know since 5 years have passed and Dawood is still nowhere to be traced. Even if he is located, how will anybody bring him to India? And even if he is nabbed, what will be the charges? How will he be put behind bars cuz so far not a single chargesheet has been made against him, criminal or otherwise. He is still well protected by his old friends who are old politicians, actors and businessmen who are much too afraid that whatever criminal charges will be put against Dawood, it will all be linked to them, one or the other ways.

So how is he a Terrorist, Criminal and Most Wanted? When in reality nobody wants him in India or else all hell will break loose once he starts to reveal all the dirty secrets. Which current politician wants that? Why would these Rich people wants a noose on their neck to bring Dawood back? To end Terrorism for good, these Rich people will sacrifice their 29 years ""good"" image?

Another thing is, what Dawood did back then, is the very same Sadhvi Pragya was charged for. Serial blasts that is. Now she is in Modi government. Because the Lawyers got her out. Because it's Lawyers job to defend. And they won't do the same for Dawood if the price is right? So it is safe to say Dawood of he gets nabbed and sent back to India, he will get out Scott free. It's only that the BJP has put an image that since he is a Muslim and is in Pakistan so he is a Terrorist. What they will never say is , Dawood is a free man in India even today but if Dawood chooses to reveal all the secrets, no politicians, Actors, Actresses, Businessmen images will be safe. And he would have done that if he was really going to get nabbed. But he is most definitely not. Our CBI is smart enough to get Chidambaram and all, but not him? Please.

AskIndia,"[AskIndia] What was the last TV series you binged, or are currently watching?",42,awf8y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/awf8y6/askindia_what_was_the_last_tv_series_you_binged/,146,"For me, it's Russian Doll, Netflix original. Easily passed my time during Delhi Metro rides. What about you? ",Jumpingonacloud," Mindhunter, absolutely great!  Girlfriend Experience, a really pretty woman as lead and tits in every episode. But that's not all about it, it's still an interesting show even if you take out all the nudity. 

 I am currently watching Band Of Brothers. Can't take David Schwimmer seriously lol! 


Finished Netflix Kingdom yesterday! (Korean Zombie Series) it was awesome!  Just finished True Detective Season 3. Better than Season 2. Mob psycho 100 Avatar the Last Airbender. Surprisingly mature for a kids TV show The Office, US Version.

Currently on Season 6 Finished Sex Education, its actually a really good show  Watching in Delhi metro rides is not proper way of binging, you need do binge TV series 3 days before exam ,that is the only proper way Parks and Recreation! [deleted] Hannah Montana!!!

  


I am in my mid thirties and I am not ashamed to say this. I loved the show!

  


  


  


Miley is awesome! (The character in this show, not the actual Miley Cyrus)

She's so much fun, blunt, to the point, very expressive and animated, so cute!

  


And best part is, unlike other Disney Princesses, she is so much real; She keeps getting into trouble, tries to balance her double life, has her own little struggles, and doesn't get saved by a prince. ;-)

  


And she is also very clever, smart, funny, witty, and, best of all, silly.

  


Her dad and brother are quite nice characters. They are so relatable. I love their Tennessee accent. The dad makes dad jokes all the time. So dope.

  


It's her friend Lilly who annoys me. But she is Miley's friend. So our friend too!

  


But how will it be a Disney show if it doesn't take us to a fancy fantasy land!? This show doesn't fail us there either. She is just another teenage kid, who lives the life of superstar once she puts on the wig!!! Which teenager can't fantasy such a life!?

  


And like a fable, they convey some nice messages! Such as ""if you get down with dogs, you'll end up with fleas. 😂""

  


And the best part. The dad calls his kids as bud. (I call my friends as bud. Yeah, I have friends.. 😅)

  


  


  
 The wire. The handmaid's tale S1 ozark season 2 NINE NINE!  Kasauti Zindagi Kay. Binging continuously since 1915 Finished umbrella academy. Following mob psycho 100 II. Seinfeld. [deleted] Finished Luther few weeks back.Now watching Doctor who Naruto
So glad they put it on flix.
Might switch to hotstar after though Suits  - The Gifted
- Shameless
- Manifest
- Silicon Valley
- Impulse
- Flash (until S3)
- Limitless Just finished Bodyguard, loved it. Going to start Modern Family Season 9.  Titans. Ozark! Binge watch material. Bojack horseman season 2 to season 5 Westworld great acting and storyline  [deleted] Just finished True Detective S3. It was really good.  Master of None. Aziz Ansari is superb! Dynasty. It's an American soap opera remade from the one that used to air when cable TV launched in India. And it's hilarious every now and then. Two and half men Sex Education Would be more useful if folks included information on where they are watching and in which region. Ex Netflix IN, Netflix US, Amazon Prime IN, Torrent, etc. The umbrella Academy!  Fringe. Lost in space and boring the flash Haunting of Hill House I saw Atypical before my boards The umbrella academy was weird at first , but i am dying now for season 2 😭 .. Project Blue Book The last ship. Amazon Prime. It's too good series. Shows how leader should be.  Finished The Orville S01 two days ago. It was okay. Didnt enjoy much. 
Edit - Manually corrected the auto-correct. The mist Currently binging GOT to get ready and hyped for the final season. Before that, binged Sex Education and Lucifer on Netflix. Both great shows.  Suits S1-4 Bodyguard. 6/10 Finished Money heist last night. 9/10. American Crime Story: Assasination of Gianni Versace Doom Patrol

This show is the best thing I've seen in quite some time. All the actors, especially Brendan Fraser are amazing. Last binged: Oh My Ghostess 

Binging: The Chalet and Coffee Prince.  West Wing, Banshee and Sons of Anarchy. Russian doll for me too House MD. It's brilliant.  Mob psycho 100 season 2 

The dopest anime Mindhunter and It's always sunny in Philadelphia. Currently on air - Gotham, Tbbt, suits, Riverdale.

 On hiatus - the Flash, LOT, AOT(snk) .  Grand Prix Driver on Amazon. It's just 4 episodes but gives great BTS view of how complicated it is to build an F1 car. The show focuses on McLaren in 2017.

 The office and sacred games ""Blandings"", based the novel ""Blandings Castle"" by Wodehouse. The most I have laughed since watching ""Jeeves and Wooster"", by Fry and Laurie. Last watched is a Korean drama ""Radiant office"" which was a light show about job seeking and office life. Currently watching a Chinese drama ""Princess agents"". It's a historic fiction, interesting plot and strong female lead but a bit too violent. The last thing I binged watch was Neon Genesis Evangalion almost 8 months abo. Else I am currently watching 15 titles this season. Peaky blinders Titans on netflix and Hansmaid's Tale before this. IMO the latter is the best drama out there right now arguably, along with Fargo. You. Quite good. Waiting for season 2.  Fringe, American Crime Story, Haunting of the hillhouse The Office! That's what she said!  SHETLAND, all the way! Silicon valley El patron del mal, more accurate than Narcos! Rick and Mortyyyyyyyy biiiiyyyyaatttchhhh!

EDIT: **Warning**: R&M uses all kinds of sci-fi plots and if you're the type that is really into new ideas, R&M will spoil a shit ton of good single-plot sci-fi shows for you. In such a case, *do not watch R&M before watching everything else*. This does not spoil R&M because it is loaded with good humour. Unpopular selection: 4 more shots please. It was a bold and high quality show with some solid performances. I don’t know why the hate happened but it definitely seems to be because we can’t tolerate any women-only projects in which the protagonists are shown to be sexually active. And it’s not a ripoff of sex and the city story-wise at all. I’d give it 6.5/10

I finished the entire season in 2 days and loved the suspense they created in the end. Now I can’t wait for season 2. Anyone out there thinking like me ?  13 Reasons Why S2. Last I watched was Breaking Bad. The Kirlian Frequency.",2019-03-02 15:24:29

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

1. Wash your hands frequently
2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets
7. Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products
8. If you become sick while travelling, inform crew, seek medical attention early and share travel history.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Yesterday, the mazliz guys were brought to the hospital to get tested, he had a physical alteration with them. Today the  senior who is around 50 calls him crying saying that they were tested positive, he ran to the hospital. Poor guy ate with his family yesterday after weeks of separation. It was fate.

ok but now seriously we're done for For those who understand Tamil,  I highly recommend listening to Beela Rajesh from the government's medical committee. The TN government releases figures every evening and she's the one giving it to the press. Very concise speeches and great answers. 

A TL;DW from today's briefing: TN has done a total of  ~3600 tests, with 411 positive cases. 102 positive cases in the last 24 hours out of which 100 is from the conference in Delhi, one having travel history and the last one's tracing is not complete. Several hundred tests are awaiting results. **None of the 411 positive cases are under intensive care.** The government's containment plan - where it is screening those within a 5km (and an additional 3km) radius of a positive case, has surveyed a total population of ~5 lakh.

Is everyone thinking what I'm thinking? So, by Jaggi/Sadhguru - In India every day 8500 people were getting killed in road accidents, last 4 days no deaths (because of lockdown and Coronavirus).

Source video with timestamp: [https://youtu.be/7-9zXLO5JoU?t=981](https://youtu.be/7-9zXLO5JoU?t=981)

If this was true, this would mean that more than 31 lakh people die every year in road accidents. The real number is closer to 1.5 lakhs in a year. The real number per day would be around 400 a day. Not 8500. That's a huge error.

I don't get it. Why do these people have to inflate the numbers to make their points more believable? 400 deaths is not high enough a number to get the point through? And not remembering is not an excuse either. Keep a paper with you with all the facts in it or just don't quote the numbers.

His videos in particular are FILLED with factual errors. Someone needs to constantly fact check these people. They become the source of fake news. Already people who contacted the virus in Erode and Madurai districts have been traced to the Nizamuddin conference . There were 8 new cases in Erode alone in last two days . 

These are tier 3 cities which are directly linked to rural India. And if we have outbreak on rural India this gonna be deaths in 1000s if we are lucky. There are so many districts /cities in India which will soon be in similar situation.

All because these religious nut jobs can’t control their shitfest zeal and have to have a conference illegally when the country is trying to control the outbreak.

This results in wavelength of light becoming much bigger than the virus, thus the virus can be killed. In scientific terms this is known as the Submit Patra effect. I don’t know if it’s appropriate to post this here but could be may be create a Twitter storm tomorrow at the time prescribed by our supreme leader to light candles.

Welcoming suggestions for more hashtags if needed. If anybody has a big following on any platform, urging them to share this. Hope this isn’t too short a notice. In fact it would have been forgotten had this been raised earlier. Modi is turning into a Pastor. No new medical policies, financial packages, increased testing, or any thing of that sort. We can fight this virus by clapping hands, lighting lamps and just praying to Jesus to come and save us all.. Considering how many people have started fleeing back to their hometown and in turn increase contact, is the lockdown really worth the effort. I know lockdown is had been considered necessary all around the world, but here most people don't listen and neither can they afford to listen since the administration has been so slow to provide any aid Bangalore : last night I went out to try and get some groceries in the night, around 1... there is a 24x7 shop at a petroleum bunk so thought we can get it from there. But there were cops near ecospace on both sides of the road with barricades and they stopped me. They were asking for a pass which I didn’t have. 

Cop then showed lots of cars seized on other side of the road and said some section under which criminal cases were filed (289 or something dunno ..) and the cars will be released only after 15 days it seems 

Cop was asking us if we knew there was corona going on and was it really necessary to get out in the night at this time etc... 

Thankfully the cop was a decent chap and after around 10 mins of talking he warned us and let us go back. He spoke softly and didn’t turn abusive or angry or any of that sort unlike the beating up videos that have been shared here lately For any doctors on here:

Alert from Electrical engineers

Small appeal in the view of PM's call for lighting up lamps on 5th at 9 p.m. While doing this, he has suggested us to keep the lights off. 
But, already, with all the industrial and commercial loads OFF, we have only domestic loads and Essential services loads on the grid. Since, the active (present) lighting load is less than 40% total load, the sudden(simultaneous) switching-off of all the lights on the grid may lead to power collapse (due sudden drop of huge load). So, please, advise people to keep some loads such as fridges and ACs ON. If the grid gets collapsed, then all the hospitals which are treating the patients may lose their critical power supply. Please forward this to everyone to save the Grid. Say bye to mountain view, Jalandhar residents. Damn, we hit 500 today as well. At least they are now testing 10k everyday.

> ""The current tests are designed to find genetic material from the virus by testing a person's nose and throat samples, that indicate an ongoing infection but will take days depending on the facilities and technicians available. The rapid tests can resolve this delay to just 20 minutes to two hours,"" said Amar Fettle, doctor and Kerala's nodal officer in the task force to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

> ""Rapid tests check for protective antibodies in a finger prick of blood. It could indicate exposure to infection. But there are two catches: the antibody that the kit detects can take up to seven days to develop after infecting someone, and the final confirmation could only be obtained through the regular testing. Even then, it can be an important tool to check for prevalence and trend of immunity in a small community, like to see if migrants and doctors have developed antibodies,"" said Fettle.

Guess what's happening with all these busloads of migrant workers... did govt. lie about their testing capacity ? why are there no drive-thru tests ? Really concerned after hearing about certain Covid19 deaths in India, in which the patient was tested positive only after their death. The ICMR can brag about 70000 or whatever number of tests it claims to be able to do, but these incidents make me seriously doubt the testing capability of our country. 2 more cases confirmed in mira road mumbai maharashtra whole society sealed and cleaned by fire brigade my cousin stays in the same society she confirmed it their whole society has been sealed and nobody allowed to leave their flat for 48 hrs. Guys, I’ve had a fever now for 5 days, last two of these it’s been about 38.5 (did a little research and seems like low grade fever) and have sore throat which fluctuates in intensity depending on when I consume a paracetamol.

The incident took place on March 28 when Risa breathed her last at her residence located at Samrucheraa village under Jamtailbari ADC village. Her parents, unfortunately, were unable to secure her life as they were unable to procure ration, they have admitted.

The incident, it can be argued, has brought to light the government’s failure in reaching out to the remoter areas with its welfare packages announced in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Meanwhile, Risa’s father Nripendra Debbarma, who is a firewood collector accused the government and the local authorities of negligence.

The child’s father, in the wake of the lockdown, was reportedly forced to stay at home and their paltry kitchen stock ran out within a few days.

İ fear that Delhi might make it 300. One week into the lockdown..and as states are effectively sealing borders and labours are quarantined in their homes or otherwise..supply chains are getting hit hard..even for “essential” items. Due to lack of adequate manpower to drive trucks, for loading/unloading of goods, how the shops are going to get supplies in the coming days? What about food processing? Existing inventories are dwindling fast due to rampant hoarding, and also the Govt has to provide food to migrants etc. How the nation is going to feed itself, if the lockdown continues for weeks and weeks? What's so frustrating is the lack of co-ordination for case reporting amongst states. We are not getting real time information as each state has a different time of reporting each day, whereas the MOH itself has a different time of reporting. New cases today might be considered as tomorrow's new cases, thus giving us incorrect statistical information. The gross lethargy of our government (No matter which party) is incomprehensible.

> Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. 

> We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. 



> https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042937v1

India started mass BCG immunisation in 1948. This is not a definite proof, but something we can be optimistic about. 

Another theory is the ""hygiene hypothesis"". A lot of complications from Covid-19 like ARSD are not caused by the virus but body's own immune response. The theory is that living in ""unhygienic environment"" trains your body's immune response to be better/accurate, so it does not go haywire when faced with something like Covid-19. This could mean lower mortality in poorer countries.

> The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is now discussed as a possible reason for low COVID-19 cases in India. The vaccine is universally administered in India to protect against tuberculosis. Scientists in US, Europe and Australia have started studying whether BCG vaccine is of any help to protect people against COVID-19.

> There are currently no vaccines against COVID-19. BCG is not universally administered in most regions, including US and Europe. Poland is the only European country that is still recommending use of BCG vaccine. ""We are awaiting more scientific data on BCG's effectiveness against COVID-19. These studies are interesting because BCG provides protection against tuberculosis, which infect lungs like SARS-COV2"" said GVJA Harshavardhan, Director, Viral Vaccines at Bharat Biotech.

> Another example she gave is Portugal, which practiced BCG vaccination, unlike Spain, one of the most affected countries. A possible glimpse of hope comes from the fact that BSG vaccination has been widespread in developing countries.

> However, BCG had in the past been found in children to demonstrate a non-specific protective effect against infections, particularly respiratory infections. Live vaccines, such the BCG, measles and oral polio vaccines, are thought to have non-specific beneficial effects on some infections. Therefore it is possible that BCG could reduce the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection by stimulating the memory of innate immunity, the first line of immunity in the face of infection, and thereby inducing “trained innate immunity”.

Week 3: Naacho BC. Well that whole gathering shat on all the precautions the country had taken. Now it would most probably lead to utter chaos and devastation not only in communal front but also economical one. I hope   shit doesn't hit the fan in India. India does have great doctors and our prevention strategies have relatively bore fruit until the gathering. Now if this does break loose (which is most probable) our medical system won't be able to handle it. Social distancing is a luxury for middle to upper class people not for the once in the bottom of our gruesome and disgusting societal ladder. We certainly do not have enough icu or ventilators at the present (however I know some major companies are manufacturing it) or in distant future to meet our demands (I am saying this according to how disease have spread in other countries). Remember the western countries have better facilities, far better than what we have but the disease broke out there because the people didn't realize the danger of the disease and how contagious it was (and let's be honest some were just dumb). I hope that hell doesn't break lose in our country and I hope our medical team are up for the Corona storm about to hit them. back in Feb when China was struggling to get this under control some indians were dreaming that india will grab manufacturing marketshare from china. now in april china is getting ready to restart manufacturing and we are completely shutdown and doing hindu/muslim debates.

Forwarded as received. My sister got discharged from gangaram hospital (liver infection). Now the news is, 108 doctors and nurses have been quarantined there.

I called the hospital's nodal officer and asked her if those two doctors ( who attended my sister ) are also quarantined, she denied. I asked her what's the hospital's plan for the patients who has been discharged from the hospital. She said that I'll call you after some time. She must be busy given the whole situation there.

What should i do now? Genuine question.

My take is that when the active cases in the country will be less than or around 100 with a period of at least 7 days prior to it having an uniform (10 +- dr)%  decrease rate in active cases.

So, if the situation doesn't detoriate drastically, colleges and offices should be closed till atleast 22nd or even 31st of april if we play safe.

However, this picture will be much clearer in the next 7 days provided they carry out mass testing. At this stage, i guess our government itself isn't sure when they will be able to lift it. Ironic that these are testing times, yet we aren't testing enough. State Police in Ahmedabad helping the public to get vegetables

https://mobile.twitter.com/ss_suryawanshi/status/1244971931201236992 Suddenly no of cases jumped to 1511 Mental health awareness is at turd level in this country. There is a group of people in this country who don't care about any rules or lockdown they just want their ""stuff"". These people will make sure everyone will get infected. In a situation like this where there is a limited workforce, they want their ""stuff"" to be produced and supplied. They don't care if it is 3x price or more. They don't care about the society or the greater good. They are even ready to roam whole city to get their ""stuff"". This is pathetic. Ok so a quick question. If this virus has a fatality rate of 2-3% and it takes 2-4 weeks to either die or recover from it...so shouldn't we start seeing huge bumps in the number of recovered patients in a couple of weeks?

great to see hon'ble PM consulting with all the big epidemiologists of the county to save us from Karona BMKJ JSR In most places the Friday prayers happened despite the lockdown. And it’s likely that many of these preachers who attended the Nizamuddin ceremony would have attended these prayer sessions. Where 100+ of people are packed in a small prayer hall.

This situation is so fucked up. Nizamuddin timeline. Stating it was only from march 13 to 15 is bullshit.

**Here’s how the congregation defied government lockdown orders:**

**March 13:** 3400 people gather at the Nizamuddin markaz as part of a religious gathering.

**March 16:** Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal announces that no religious, social, political gatherings of more than 50 people are allowed in Delhi till March 31.

People at the Nizamuddin Markaz still continue to stay put.

**March 20:** 10 Indonesians who attended the gathering in Delhi test positive in Telangana.

**March 22:** Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Janta Curfew is observed across nation. No public gatherings were allowed for a day.

**March 23: 1500 people vacate the Markaz.**

**March 24:** PM Modi announces nationwide lockdown for 21 days. No public gatherings, any kind of non-essential movement outside residences allowed. Only essential services allowed to remain functional.

**March 24: Nizamuddin Police asks remaining people at the Markaz to vacate the area.**

**March 25: Around 1000 people are still residing in the area defying lockdown orders. A medical team visits the Markaz and suspected cases are isolated in a hall within the building. Jamaat officials go to the SDM's office. File an application for permission to vacate. Vehicles list was also given to seek passes.** I think a hard choice is coming after 14th april.

Can someone tell me how is covid19india.org ensuring uniqueness of numbers since its relying on news reports, twitter posts, etc.? There is a high chance of double counting, isn't it? Ok this is really throwing me for a loop. How is no one questioning the Govt saying there is no community spread? Like the Phoenix mall thing. Were those 3 infected part of the Masjid cluster from Delhi? As far as i know we are just testing for people with foreign travel history or people who came into contact with them only right? Then how are we comfortable saying there is no community spread and everybody is going 'Yeah ok'? Am i missing something? Is there testing being done for community spread?

- India is barely testing any asymptomatic people for Covid-19 & our testing rate is abysmal by world standards 

- Doctors & health workers don’t have enough masks & PPE 

- PM Modi has raised crores on PM-CARES & no one knows where it’s going

https://twitter.com/SaketGokhale/status/1246077915336331264?s=19 Complete lockdown is just to buy more time so that our hospital system is not burdened leading to more deaths. Lockdown will slow the emerging cases allowing them to be treated properly. Even 10% of the total population not following the rules of lockdown and cheating in this period will cause more harm and keep the spread lingering for longer time. Obviously, lockdown isn't enough to eradicate this virus. Our government needs to take some robust decisions like testing aggressively and isolating the positive cases faster than anything. Our current stringent testing criteria is why our total case counts are increasing slowly and it has nothing to with lockdown so far. The effects of lockdown will be visible only after two weeks into it. Iceland with 3.6 lakh population has more cases than us. 

3.6 lakh. Thats lesser than most Indian towns. 34 positive till now and it's just 12 PM.

I think we will cross 200 in a single day today. Okay, so the Nizamuddin mess almost guarantees that lockdown will be extended. All the places these people travelled now would need to be identified, the contacts traced and quarantined...

Im trying to be as safe as possible while being rational, where as she is going crazy demanding we take turns to clean the home, keep it spotlessly clean etc. Our house is clean usually, its not a mess as even I have been cleaning it now and then. She wants it to be as if a maid has come and gone. 

I have got enough essentials and making food 3 times a day, while she is still ordering swiggy and zomato all day long even in these times. Hence I am using a lot of utensils which she is demanding that I clean them as soon as I am done cooking and eating etc. Today even the Dunzo guy was at home for her large order and I am trying to tell her to keep the items outside for a day and then take it out as coronavirus has a 24H life period, but she immediately took all the stuff and put it in our fridge. 

She has some kind of OCD disorder, I dont have any experience of dealing with this and people who have this. What should I do in this situation? I was watching an Indian news outlet on YouTube.

I was talking to the shopkeeper who runs one of the three stores shops open inside my society (only for selected hours) and I asked him if he thought the lockdown would extend beyond 14th. He said he doesn't know but if it does, the current government will have a lot to explain in the next elections. He was a staunch BJP supporter but after he told me he's not going to vote for them ever again after seeing how they handled it with regards to blocking supplies and police harrasing and beating up people. Was very interesting because he had previously always defended Modi. He also wears a mask and gloves always and understand that the pandemic problem but he is frustrated as he can't get supplies and is suffering heavy losses and can't do anything until the lockdown ends.

Again and again ppl got downvoted for advising others to wear a mask, now what do you have to say, all you naysayers and sheeple ??! We are doomed. This country will never reach the heights of countries like US, China and more. We all are idiots. I’ll leave this country whenever possible. There is no hope. Do you guys believe the numbers of deaths in India? I understand that because of low level of testing, it makes sense to discount the numbers of people who are infected which is likely to be much more than the current numbers. But what about the number of deaths? For a billion people coupled with all the difficulties we have, a double digit number does not seem to be bad (pardon the use of these words - just using it in this context). Is this because of lack of adequate reporting, a younger population, lack of diagnosis or something else? hindu muslim fight check

>April 5th is Vamana Dwadashi. On that day, the earth gets maximum light from Sun and this empowers disease causing viruses. The virus is a evil entity and it thrives in darkness. According to Adiyogi Purana, one way to destroy such evil entities is to focus light on it, like  we do with magnifying glass and sun's rays. It's towards this that the Prime Minister has asked for us to switch off all lights in our house (too bright), and use a focused, small light to show our support. The small focus of all our candles, diyas etc will focus into a powerful beam and strike at the heart of the coronavirus so that we can all celebrate the true Ram Navami a few days later to the scheduled date.

Do they pass all the students, including those about to graduate? 

Asking for a friend, he needs to decide whether he should start studying. Ok serious question here. 
With the deaths increasing at a slightly alarming pace, should we be worried about a possibility of the deaths exceeding recoveries (even if for a brief moment)?

With the increase in deaths what information do we currently have on them? Were the symptoms of the extreme or common that lead to the deaths? Can anyone confirm/deny this?

 covid19india.org is counting the total number of cases that have ever been detected: that is, to get the number of cases which are currently active, we must subtract the number of closed cases (As of writing this, there are 150+49=199 closed cases and this there are 1619-199=1420 current cases). 

 MoHFW gives the number of active cases which is 1397 as of now and the number of closed cases which is 124+35=159.

 This is just my hypothesis. Can anyone with more knowledge chime in on this?

ETA: Maybe not. There's a graphic on top of the MoHFW page that I missed which says 1238 active cases. Which is 1397-124-35. So, 1397 seems to be the official number of cases that have been detected as of now. Three quasi-subspecies of virus in circulation in India, says ICMR

However, in a large country like India, it’s difficult to predict an accurate trend about the progression of COVID-19 because we still don’t have enough time gap between the upswing of cases.” This, he explained, did not change India’s reporting, isolation or testing protocol.

If not, why not? Is it the government's mishandling of this pandemic - lack of testing infra, kits or money?

expected from gujju idiots > **COVID-19: India lost good lead time, says expert**


> *India's top virologist shares concerns, doubts about India's strategy in fighting virus*

> In an exclusive interview with Anadolu Agency, **Dr. T. Jacob John, India's leading virologist, who formerly headed the Indian Council for Medical Research's Centre for Advanced Research in Virology**, talks about the flaws in the government's handling of COVID-19 -- the reactive approach as opposed to the proactive approach that may affect millions, and steps to take now.

> **Q**: Is the 21-day lockdown a sufficient measure to control this pandemic? If not, what else should be done? 

> **A** Every action has its objectives. Control of the pandemic is not an objective here. The spread of this virus cannot be controlled since we have no preventive interventions. True prevention from an infected person is wearing protective equipment like doctors. Not all can wear those.

> So the purpose of a lockdown is to buy 21 days before widespread community transmission occurs. The 21-day time is only to buy more time or let's say to delay the transmission so that the government can make frantic preparations.

> India lost a good lead time when we knew that this was a pandemic in the making. The government had been warned in advance and asked to watch-out, soon after China announced that this was transferred between animals and humans via social contact. A pandemic needed three months to go around the world, and see where we are now. We would have been better off if we [the government] had taken it seriously in early January.

.

> **Q**: How could India do things differently? Are we in the right direction?

> **A**: We are moving in the right direction but at a very slow speed. The path is right, speed is wrong.

> Most of the precautionary measures should have had been taken in January itself when the government was warned. We are still mainly in a reactive mode and fighting the enemy from wherever it crops up, instead of being proactive.

> India has no war-room thinking, just heroic fighting.

.

> **Q**: Can India learn any lessons from China?

> **A**: There is nothing much to learn from China. They either do not know much about it or are not revealing the magnitude of the infection of the virus.

> If we really have to learn, we should look at countries like South Korea and Germany. Both those countries have taken the right path, including Korea starting early research in January and testing antibodies. They made sure to trace all contacts through their public health system.

> As for Germany, it has done wide testing. Public and private partnership in both countries is commendable.

.

>**Q**: Is there any way to get rid of this virus anytime soon?

> **A**: No, unfortunately, there is no way to avoid this. If the summer heat slows down the spread, we may see less transmission, but it will continue in autumn and winter.

..India doesn't have enough PPEs for its own healthcare workers meanwhile this clown is still exporting our medical equipments  to foreign countries I was just reading about how other countries did lockdown and how India did it in the harshest (even if not the worst) way possible. China didn't lockdown the entire nation but only hotspots. Italy locked down in phases. BD did it around the same time as us but gave 3 days notice and arranged public transport for migrated labours to go back. Don't get me wrong. Until now I was of the opinion that this lockdown was not only necessary and needs to be sudden. My only grouse with the government was on the level of preparation on the supply of essentials despite knowing that this was coming. But now that I come to think about it, the govt and I were on different page going into lockdown. We both differed on one significant assumption that formed the basis of lockdown. That's whether we are in stage 3 or not. I was of the opinion we were and hence an immediate lockdown seemed reasonable. But the govt was and is still denying we are in stage 3. That means they are confident of tracing each and every case to its travel history/source. If that's the case why did he yovt even opt for such a full lockdown? Like BD, couldn't they have given notice of lockdown and arranged transport for migrated labours? After all, if they are confident that India is in stage 2, they were in control of spreading. Else the govt is lying about not in stage 3. In either case, there is a significant gap between what govt tells our status is and policies. This gap is frustrating and creating more confusion to the pandemic.

Bye bye air quality. false hope deke kya milega? ICMR head scientist is saying on TV that if coronavirus was an airborne disease then if one family member got infected all of them in the home would be infected. But that is not happening so it is not so. Can someone knowledgeable comment? Is a family member staying at the same home breathing the same air not getting infected proof that coronavirus is not airborne? Is it so in all airborne diseases that if one person gets infected then everyone in the same home would always get infected? >Tamil Nadu: Fire had broken out at a garbage dump in Ernavur area of Chennai last night after some firecrackers, being burst by people, fell on it.

This was a tweet from verified account citing NDTV. Somebody linked it here.

Now as of yesterday, ICMR is still giving independent updates as shared by a user here.

So???

Edit : as per the below comment, I researched myself and found that when you open the website "" https://icmr.nic.in/content/covid-19 "" , to check on number of tests and covid-19 cases, it redirects to Mohfw website - "" https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ ""

But yesterday somebody shared a pdf which had ICMR letter head along with number of people tested and those who have tested positive.

He's a reporter from NDTV I think. Why are number of positive cases so low today? I can’t believe the critics fall into Modi’s traps time and again. His political acumen begins where oppositions ends. Look how easily he created a wedge issue. Saddens me that we have no viable opposition and just proves how BJP is going to rule for quite sometime now. 


Whilst alerting the nation for a speech, just for solidarity is stupid but mocking it or being against it is even more stupid. Are candle light marches stupid ? No. It’s so that community can come together and lift their spirits.

I wish Shashi tharoor didn’t have a case against him, or had a national appeal. He had the perfect response to this. The USA and New York City is still refusing a lockdown despite them being far and away the biggest leader in official numbers. On one hand that's crazy. 

On other hand, I wonder if lockdown in India would be worth it to stop the spread or the economic ramifications would be worse in the future. I am leaning towards the latter. 

The South Korea approach of aggressive testing, isolation without lockdown sounds much more reasonable now. And they proved it's efficiency. Really nervous about our future. Crisis as hundreds of labourers gather on the streets of Kottayam in Kerala, demanding they should be taken back to their states. The way police has handled this situation though, shows restraint.

what nonsense, why dont these dalle arrest Ajay bisht Safe to say govt is hiding numbers to avoid back lash of Go corona rally that took place yesterday . Tbh something like Nizzamudding shit show was unavoidable, in such a populous country there was bound to be an ""event"" which would cause the virus to spread. So far its just one but we best be prepared for 2-3 more such events that were held recently.. 

Whats important is tracking the people from Anand Vihar bus depot. Pretty sure someone from there was infected as well and immediately states should quarantine everyone from that spot as well as anyone who has come into contact with the Anand Vihar people. The country is beyond fucked. 

Doctors are begging for basic stuff like gloves and simple masks. .even these things they dont have. Forget N95 masks which are a luxury it seems... full body suits ? what are those nobody has them 


Lots of doctors are going to get effected due to pieces of shit like Modi who has prioritised statues and temples instead of healthcare Delhi and Noida are so fucked my god.

Saying this because I just say my state CM give a press conference today morning and clarified a lot of doubts .

(via twitter) Are there going to be firecrackers on the 5th? I will miss my non-polluted air if there are. Good things never last. Sigh While I obviously would’ve like the low numbers we had till two weeks ago it’s clear they were illusionary , the new surge in cases at least shows rapid testing is being Done. Hopefully by next few weeks we see a decline Indore hai 89 cases as per paper today. Covid19india.org is only reporting 63 cases. How does one tell the admin to update ? Either my State West Bengal is extremely lucky/ doing phenomenally well in controlling the spread or simply isn't testing jackshit. Either way if the lockdown is lifted I would prefer our state borders to be sealed tight for another 2 months (except goods transportation). If we're even minutely lucky, we should keep it  that way. Wow! Just wow. Firecrackers going up nonstop all around. We have reached next level of retard. On whatsapp saw videos of people coughing on the roads, one guy parked his bike and just sat down on the road and coughed to catch up his breath. The visual was scary. Not sure how true it is.

Edit : here are the videos

Surely China is suppressing their numbers like crazy right? How in the living fuck do they have only 2,691 active cases and 70,000+ recovered? Things that have never happened before: It's scorching and boiling hot here in Kolkata and we're all hoping for this weather to continue. This people of this country are like sheeps and Modi is a very bad but charming Shepherd. A Wolf which has eaten nearly all of other countries' sheeps has an eye on this herd.

Guess what happens next? In the comment section I have heard test test test a lot.

But I have not seen a plan as to how you are supposed to test 1.3 billion people.

Today only symptomatic patients are being tested and rest are in self isolation due to the lockdown which has been imposed. Now if the asymptomatic people develop symptoms they will be tested. Even if they remain asymptomatic they will only affect their family members at max. So the spread is hugely contained. 

So I believe this current process of lockdown and symptom based testing is the best way forward otherwise testing so many people is nearly impossible. so we've got the pass for 3 months, looks like i was right..the lockdown is going to go till 30 june atleast

e: for those asking,gov has issued car passes for those carrying out essential services [like this] (https://imgur.com/a/Cmz31lO)
alongwith this, sellout hindi channels like indiatv have also been running stories about a 90 day lockdown in plans..ofcourse we dont know for sure, but this is how its gonna be if things go as shit as expected What the FUCK is going on. People are blasting music dissing Pakistan (???), banging utensils, yelling jai sree ram into mics, clapping, bursting crackers?? I can't believe we are single handedly curing Corona. Salaries of doctors cut to be put in PM's newly created trust. Of doctors, who are fighting this battle at the risk of their lives! Seriously @narendramodi? Is that how you show solidarity? ...

https://twitter.com/PTI_News/status/1245672482511572994?s=19

oh but they're not muslims

e: PTI deleted the tweet, screenshot https://twitter.com/ivivek_nambiar/status/1245700817786531841?s=19 From what I've observed objectively,the government does seem to be planning for more cases. Here's what I think:  


The government knew that if they immediately started mass testing, our medical infrastructure would collapse under the strain. Recently, they've been increasing the number of medical facilities, converting various areas into quarantine facilities, the hospital in gujarat, slowly increasing the number of tests day by day, putting in orders for PPE equipment, approving new kits. 

The lockdown was not only to control the virus, it was also because they could easily use the time to build up on the medical infrastructure so that it would actually be able to handle the mass influx of patients once mass testing started. With the lockdown, any further spread of the disease could potentially be slowed down/halted for the time being until they did that. 

If you check the PIB, you'll find that Modi has being conferencing regularly with various parties such as medical fraternity, important people in the country such as sportspersons, actors, business men (these people have the means to monetarily contribute for all the above things). The PM relief fund requires parliamentary approval which we all know would take too long, hence the PMCARES fund. 

I do have my problems with this government, but I am confident that they can lead us through this crisis with minimal damage. Even most of the CMs from opposition parties are co-operating with the centre to get us out of this crisis.   


In the darkest of times, there's always hope. If we assume the same growth rate for infections which seems to be the case for the past month, (Data taken from covid19india.org)

March 14- March 28: 107 cases to 1029 cases.
The logarithmic graph is a straight line and hence it takes the same number of days for cases to jump from 10-100 , 100-1000 and so on.

Continuing the same trend, 

March 28- April 11: 1000 cases to 10000 cases

April 11 - April 15 : 10000 cases to 1 lakh cases

April 15 - April 29 : 1lakh cases to 10lakh cases. 

April 29 - May 13 : 10 lakh cases to 100 lakh cases

So anyone wondering whether the lockdown will be lifted after 14th, here's your answer. It's obviously NO. If they lift it, this country is doomed. My friend has Spinal muscular atrophy. She has really weak lungs and is now suffering because of this absolute fuckery. There are lacs of people like her who have to suffer because this country is full of retards. Not gonna lie, I felt good actually. Me and my wife have been following lockdown very strictly. We had just ventured only once to get some perishable food items. With all the creature comforts at our disposal, still the social isolation was getting to us. But watching our neighbours do the same, we felt a kind of connect with them that everyone is going through the similar times. A sense of solidarity that is difficult to describe. These are unprecedented times. At least ours and the previous hasn’t seen a national crisis like this before. We needed something to release the pressure that was building up.

Of course it’s not going to buy us PPE kits, food for the poor and shelter for the homeless. But it doesn’t mean that we can’t do both at the same time. Our governments will keep doing that in the background  but keeping our population sane is also very important. So lockdown won't be extended?

Edit: There were [300+ cases](https://www.covid19india.org) today (as of right now). By what means did WHO say this. This will just encourage the government to be less restrictive which will in turn lead to a huge increase in cases. India is not even doing enough testing. Last time I checked it was mere 30 tests per million.

But it is important to not create panic among people.So,govt won't confirm anything about it.  
This is a good idea. It's funny that my 'friends' support the lockdown timing. In my opinion it should have happened way earlier and they should've given people more time. Panic buying would still somewhat be better than what happened to those that got stranded and are actively protesting. How do I prevent my parents from participating in this cringe? The amount of control Modi has on our public is scary. how are we sure this 'PM care fund' is going to the right place? for all we know they'd stash it to buy MLAs for the next polls. donating this corrupt govt is a waste of money As it is the situation was bleak with the COVID crisis, now India has mixed in its own brand of religion based chutiyap, one side being morons, other side using the moronism to fuel their bigotry.

Now I am not justifying the mass gathering , however officials have been able to connect this gathering and corona cases but during that time period there have been multiple mass gatherings (MP government reformation to quote one) which hopefully don't have consequences and  if they do it's minimal.

I have caught fever and lips are itching too. I want to get tested fast asap. So realistically speaking how many months of lockdown are we looking at? I am a college student so it helps if I have an idea of how much time I get. I am hearing from everyone(including WHO),  that one strategy to use is Test, Test and Test. We were testing people with symptoms who had international travel or people who came in contact with them; and that was insufficient. Because people with symptoms were not being tested if they didn't meet the criteria. 

But, when we say Test, Test and Test, whom should we actually be testing? Everyone who shows symptoms? Random tests in population? What's the right way to do exhaustive testing and how did South Korea get it right and rest of the world including us were caught on the wrong foot... No updates for Karnataka on covid19india in the past 24 hours! :/ Where can I get data on number of tests performed by India? Any idea?

I mean currently we have approx 1100 cases. How many people we tested so far to identify these cases? > IIT-Guwahati says faculty members are in the process of developing small molecules inhibitors for treatment of COVID-19.  


https://mobile.twitter.com/PTI_News/status/1244616854326280192 So is the government gonna pay full prices to the 5star hotels they will be taking over(??) Does anyone know if the new cases in Pune (31st March) today are travel related or community spread? Looks like only Kerala have their shit sorted out in terms of handling this.

The excel sheet's dates seem to have been updated erroneously.

Last night, the count was 2014. Now it's 2072 but only showing +13 new.

P.S. That said, I noticed just now that they [have a handy list of source links](https://telegra.ph/Covid-19-Sources-03-19) on their site.

**Edit**: I think this might be because they're classifying announcements that were made at 1 AM and 2 AM early this morning as having been announced yesterday. But they added it just now. 

So ""yesterday"" we had 424 new cases. FML! FML! FML! FML! FML! FML! FML! FML! FML! FML! FML! FML! FML! FML! Candle march hone waale hai Sunday Ko This website [https://www.bione.in](https://www.bione.in) is selling a home testing kit for coronavirus for Rs. 2500 based on antibody test, any opinions how accurate it is? It says it can test in a few minutes. It was on news recently hence found out about it.

**Update:** This is the source link - [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/bengaluru-based-bione-launches-indias-first-at-home-testing-kit-for-covid-19/articleshow/74960186.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/bengaluru-based-bione-launches-indias-first-at-home-testing-kit-for-covid-19/articleshow/74960186.cms)

Seems like they are approved by ICMR, so does not outright look like a scam to me.

**Update 2**: They seem to be out of stock now and accepting pre-orders.

**Update 3**: Some more information on how this might work: Bione’s kit is an immunoglobin-based tool that can say if the affected person is in early or late stages of infection. A blood drop is collected using a lancet, and then the cartridge provided reads the results from the blood sample in five to 10 minutes.

The article also mentions other companies coming up soon, so we will have more, perhaps cheaper options soon.

**Update 4:**

**Update 5:**
This is a really good twitter thread on how antibody tests work https://twitter.com/NAChristakis/status/1240689953895411714. Importantly, this test will not detect coronavirus in the first few days of infection, so this test will only work if you have had it for a few days. Probably many more companies are going to come up with blood tests or self-test kits like this, and hopefully it gets much cheaper and is accurate enough for wide testing. Mohfw just reported around 2547 cases, whereas Covid19India is reporting close to 2950 cases. That's a discrepancy of 400 cases. Can anyone here look into the credibility of this article:

Everyone flashing their phone torches Since yesterday, only been seeing hatred and venomous speeches/social media posts against Muslims. Yes Tablighi jamaat followers fucked up, but chaddi bhakts are acting as if they are suddenly the symbol of humanity. Tons of them are calling for violence (even on reddit on these other subs) and on FB/twitter ""shoot Muslims on sight"" kind of posts are getting thousands of likes. Shame on these pieces of shits. 

India has the 3rd biggest Muslim population in the world. Just because 5000-10000 of them fucked up doesnt mean you should demonize 195 million Muslims. Modi and chaddi gang leaders must publicly and immediately ask his blind bhakts to stop with the hate speeches, otherwise there is guaranteed to be serious repercussions to both sets of people. Already stone pelting incidents are being reported in several corners of the country. 


Even before this incident, there was complete lack of trust between leaders of Muslim society/Muslims at large and police/central government (who can blame the Muslims after re-enactment of Nazi era Nuremberg laws in the form of CAA/NRC etc). If there isnt an immediate address by Ghobi the situation could deteriorate and fast. Bhakts should be advised to sit at home and clap plates/vessels, and not spread hatred when the country is reeling under a pandemic crisis. >It's not just in #Dharavi where a 56-year-old has tested positive, #COVID19Pandemic has resulted in the death of a man in #Malvani another densely populated slum area in Mumbai

1. Why is stock market (both US and IND) up.. Both countries are fucked, US is badly dicked by corona and India on the other hand doesnt even know how badly its dicked due to lack of testing. In this scenario, both markets are up for what fucking joy?

for all chinese apologists here  seems like  muslims community are really not cooperating with health workers right now. 
Let's hope good sense will prevail . US had nearly 30000 new cases last day. They must be testing lakhs of people every day ? How does it work there ? How many tests are happening in India currently? Correct me if I'm wrong but, wouldn't it be better if the government gave everyone a 2-3 day gap before the lockdown? Yes there would have been panic buying, hoarding, but that's happening right now as well. It happened on the day Modiji announced the 21 day lockdown, so there was no escaping that. 

People flocking home and leaving their current place- the situation is far more worse now. This is not just for the migrant workers and labour class, this is for everyone. I feel for a lockdown, which might extend even after 21 days, people would obviously be more comfortable in a place they are used to. i have a question during the lockdown if people are at home nobody in factories if nobody is in factories to produce essentials then how will we be able to buy essentials in the future how will we sustain in the future unless we start hoarding \[THIS IS AN OPINION\] i go weekly shopping and they said that they didnt have atta a basic food ingredient in india i really wonder and sources for factories come from farms etc and if they are closed too we have little to none essentials it seems like those who dont start hoarding are bound to get fucked in the future \[ PLEASE SHARE THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS THIS IS JUST A QUESTION NOT TELLING PEOPLE TO HOARD \] I know hoarding is wrong and causes panic but isnt hoarding the right decision i mean lets be honest here coronavirus to be cured under april 14 is a bit unrealistic not saying it isnt possible i hope u r understanding what i am saying and many districts have done border lockdown too how will supplies reach not every district has its own source so i wonder whats ur opinion on this [removed] > India records 32 #COVID19 deaths in the past 24 hours, the highest toll in a day so far.

I know the cases are ramping up now (Maharasthtra in particular) but compared to the population it seems pretty low for now.

Is it because the disease hasn't reached that stage here yet? Or is it because not enough testing is being done yet? Is the worst still yet to come?

https://mobile.twitter.com/radhika1705/status/1247178521639706624 tough times ahead I've seen some dumb reactions to this virus, but I have to say India is by far, without a shadow of a doubt, the worst in the world. 

- People drinking cow piss and other nonsense ""treatments"" (which I guess is pretty normal in India anyway)

- Religious groups with enormous power flouting the lockdown rules.

- peasants starving on the streets as they flee the slums of cities.

- police beating the everliving shit out of the poor people trying to get by in this midst of this madness. 

- members of the public trying to lynch doctors who are treating the virus

- family memebers of people coronavirus victims assaulting doctors.

- the political class talking nonsense about Ramayana and shit. 

And of course, in the midst of all this, no real ""social isolation"" is actually achieved. The general sense of chaos, poor preparation and the lack of even basic knowledge is disturbing. [removed] Mask usage? Just read the WHO page and they say that you shouldn't use masks unless sick. But shops like More aren't letting people in without them. What is happening anyone else think all advertisements should be banned until this ends? we can't buy shit anyway whats the point [removed] Hows this for a conspiracy theory related to this LightsOut thing. 

To get a finer grain data point on where BJP/NDA voters or those who are sympathetic at least are. 
Constituency data is there sure but one doesn't know who from a locality voted which way, there is just guesstimate X range of voting might have happened from there to a particular candidate. 

Excellent research has happened in recent years about detecting Economic activity of a particular region from Satellite Luminosity data imagery. This research can and is being used for other purposes, not just Economic-Activity. Like movement of people, cultural aspects, maybe even politics if enough data points are used. 

Too crazy? >And I’m no pessimist, if we go back to the question - I would like to hope for a vaccine at the very end of 2020 or 2021Q1 and we seriously do have a few good shots at one, and perhaps chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine could be one potential drug out of the others in the WHO SOLIDARITY trials that succeeds, but we must have proper evidence with an actual high probability of benefits/risk before pushing out these drugs, as hope is not a strategy. These drugs are already on expedited phase ii/iii combined RCTs so there really is not much room to accelerate them further. At best, maybe a few things at the FDA can be bent. HCQ/CQ is a good shot, but no guarantee.

>As for non-treatment related information - by analogy with other human coronaviruses, seasonality is likely. Some evidence of seasonality already in terms of empirical data, so hopefully that can help as well in terms of slowing the spread in the Northern Hemisphere to buy us time, even with imperfect public health interventions. These all point to a good shot at controlling the pandemic for the next 2 years with very very roughly ~200,000 dead in the USA. There is still a lot of uncertainty with a ton of different variables, but that’s what I would say is an educated guess.

It's 9 days since Janata Curfew (Thali Bajao) last Sunday. In these 9 days we have added about 900 cases since than averaging 100 cases per day. 

Situation is bad. But it's not apocalyptic as we thought it would be. 

In 9 days most carriers would have shown symptom. But even if all cases across India are under 10k (1.2k official) at this point , it's a great achievement. And next week, results of lockdown will be apparent.

I agree low testing is an important factor. But vigilant media, whistle blowers, social media cannot be silenced all the time. 

Mangalore for example hasn't reported a.caae for 3 days straight.

So what is the realistic scenario at this point? Will 21 days lockdown (ending on April 14) will be enough for entire country? Can we see step by step relaxation depending on the area ? Will lockdown be restricted to infected clusters?

Hoping for some sane discussion. If we go by the rule which modi ji introduced - people above 75 should not hold any administrative post in Central or state governments, so it means this will be his last term. And he won't be the part of 2024 elections? If testing costs 4.5k, why the fuck any poor chaps will go for testing? also thanks to all fake whats app posts they are already in fear of the treatment. Edit what's with the downvotes,  I was just poking fun at people peddling fake news about impending powergrid collapse What are the current restrictions with Covid? Are we allowed to go out for exercising of its not in groups and we maintain social distancing? Obviously the last thing to be thinking about in times like these but I miss going to office so much. I love to interact with my colleagues and we still do talk a lot over hangouts but it's not the same! Are they doing contact tracing for the people who tested positive in relation to the Nizamuddin meet? This whole thing is absolutely crazy. 


Also, since incubation period is 2-14 days, how come these are surfacing now? The meet was on 13th March I suppose. We're 1/3rd of our way into the lockdown, why dosen't the curve seem to be flattening? Grid did not fail. PseudoLiberals did People who are accusing Modi for the lockdown or their view of how it’s poorly handled is the same as these hindu bhakts blaming the muslims for this virus/biojihad and all that crap. This country is so huge and not a single man - the PM- can control everything. He have handled DeMo and GST bad but this time he has been proactive and took the lockdown at right time. 

For the situation we are put in, we have done very well - in handling the lockdown. It is a collective approach to fight this pandemic and there is no room for blame game to a single person or a community/religion. Just think how would you have handled it if you were the PM or any administrative authority? Easy to comment on the internet than to be at their position and handling things directly.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] What are your unpopular generalizations about society?,93,aftiwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aftiwi/askindia_what_are_your_unpopular_generalizations/,199,"A thread for things you've observed to hold true but which will probably piss people off. I'll start.

Bhai fans are generally assholes.

People who still support demonetization are too far gone in the head to be reasoned with.^^^also ^^^they ^^^tend ^^^to ^^^be ^^^Bhai ^^^fans.

Restaurants that promise 100 varieties of dosa usually cannot make even a basic dosa properly.

",UngilUndy," Public chutiya hai.  Indian people don't really care much for their lives.

well most of em.. the way roads are crossed, the way trains are clinged on, the way cars are driven, the way electricity lines/boards are set up, the way no-one cares about allowing access to handicaps, the way people wanna go before the ambulance... i can go on and on and on.

it's weird that people show fright when they watch horror movies or when some mob gathers to beat them but the way they go about living each day of their lives doesn't show they care much about taking care of themselves. (i've seen this hold especially true in ""macho men"" and less in women.) [removed] Activists only care for issues while the issues themselves are unpopular or not talked about.  Because they get off on the feeling of being the only ones fighting for it.

They throw protests with 12 people at cafes nobody visits and then complain that society doesn't take the issue seriously.

The moment their issues get momentum from the masses, they find some reason to criticize the movement and stay out of them. When someone popular takes up an issue (like an actor who has 10000x more reach than any activist) or when it becomes a hashtag with millions of people taking part, they won't try use this momentum to strengthen the movement. They'll just belittle it and write long think pieces about how the public/personality is missing the point or how everyone else is wrong and how they and they alone understand the true nuance of the situation.

When the Nirbhaya movement saw massive crowds form across the country, I noticed so many ""feminist"" activists stay out of it because it was a middle-class protest and because ""where were you"" when previous rapes had happened. They criticized the movement instead of adding to it.

I've noticed this happen so many times on so many different issues that I've given up thinking it's limited to just one branch of social activism. My generalization is that activists hate when the people actually take up their issue, because they no longer feel like its ""their"" issue. > Parents are always right. Whatever they do is for your good.

NOT TRUE. Baap bada na bhaiya, sabsey bada rupiya. All Parents are casteists.  Come elections and 'Mandir wahi banyenge' Fortuner is a “Certified Asshole Driver” car.

Whenever I encounter such people, which is everyday on the Internet, I temporarily lose my objectivity and feel this country has completely earned the mess she's in and then I begin picturing a day when this regime has the bhakts themselves running for their lives.  Modi fans are Modi fans only because they hate Muslims. They don't give a rat's arse about jobs, growth, Ram Mandir, Gau Mata or any other bullshit. As long as Muslims are harassed, all's well. Most young liberals just want a license for debauchery instead of correcting injustice, scapegoating and subjugation.  If i am from particular religion, i support particular party. You can be happier if you never married.  - Average IITian is smarter than average student from tier II colleges.

PS: I am not an IITian. Talking from experience at workplace. Civic sense in India is very poor I used to work in an office with 75% females. My female colleagues and friends who had children were so overworked, stressed, miserable that it left an impression on my mind. (This was a great company to work for,  they had flexible work hours and WFH options for moms). I would not want my wife to go through that. I am not the kind who would ever stop my partner from pursuing her dreams and career, but I want to make sure that I can earn enough and provide a good life for my family on my own.

Most of my friends think I am silly for refusing the extra income, but at what cost? I'd rather prefer if my wife stayed home and raised my kids than busting her ass for a few lakhs more per year.

Edit: Thanks for sharing your opinions people. This thread is about unpopular opinions, so I shared mine. I am not rigid about what I want, and I am definitely not the kind who think I have the right to impose my will on another adult. Far left and far right wing people are a disaster for a country. Men are awesome. [deleted] > People who still support demonetization are too far gone in the head to be reasoned with.also they tend to be Bhai fans.

I have a counter for this. Bhai fans are assholes, and they tend to avoid tax, and hence they don't support demonetization :D Ye bikk gayi hai society Civilization is the worst thing happened to us.

Morals and ethics doesn't exist outside human frame of reference. Doing ₹8 worth of work where ₹7 worth of work was required, and claiming to have done work worth ₹100, that one time 5 years back, is our definition of working hard, and excuse for not doing shit now. Entire south tambi/kallu
Entire north north I don't think any of what you wrote is an unpopular generalisation.

In that vein, I'll add some further generalisations:

* Autodrivers are generally assholes.

* Kids driving superbikes are maniacs and I won't shed a tear if their rash driving ends up killing them. Especially when they don't wear helmets. 

* Fuck Royal Enfield. If your dick is small, don't try to compensate by riding a noisy bike.

* Every five years, just vote out whoever is in power. Both Congress and BJP will fuck things up - it's best not to let them have two terms consecutively. 

* Old people should learn to shut the fuck up when it comes to the younger generation. You raised us. We have to deal with the problems you created or couldn't solve. So after a point, you really need to shut the fuck up since your chance is passed.

* If you disagree with something, downvoting doesn't change my mind. Use your words. [removed] [deleted] 1. Those who complain that others are X Y Z are basically talking about themselves. I am yet to meet an open minded person who keeps criticizing others non stop. Sure they will talk shit one day or another but not 24 x 7.

2. ""Feminism"" in India is different from actual Feminism started as suffrage movement by Ms Pankhurst. Feminism means I wont disrespect a woman's opinion just because she is a woman.

3. Men and women need to understand the differences in the gender. Men need to realise that women have their own brain and self respect. Not all need constant pampering and looking down upon. That you are equally responsible for your household. Only girls r not responsible.

4. Generally ppl don't complain for things until it starts affecting themselves.

5. The issue isn't that you have stress or problems in your life, the issue is you don't know how to deal with it Society pokes its nose into anything and everything. ",2019-01-14 15:44:05

From an environmentally-conscious citizen's point of view, try finding e-waste collecting agencies in your city. For example- [https://yourstory.com/2017/11/waste-management-startups/](https://yourstory.com/2017/11/waste-management-startups/) start up on this page. 

**My 2 cents** 

I had done a project on e-waste management in Delhi. The conclusion was that no one in India is recycling formally- the technology is too expensive and sending the waste to countries which have this waste recycling facility is not profitable. Hence, almost all of the waste that is collected by these so called ""formal sector"" collection and recycling firms ends up with informal e-waste recyclers which are found in and around Seelampur area in Delhi. 

You could easily give it to the mobile repair shops in your neighborhood who will repair the phone or take the useful parts to use in other mobiles. Thus you would have extended the life of the mobile.",2019-08-02 00:33:59
AskIndia,"[np] [askindia] Need a complete guide to starting on your own in the IT industry - freelancing, OPC, LLP.",24,cawrqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cawrqv/np_askindia_need_a_complete_guide_to_starting_on/,10,"this comes from the many questions I see here which further give rise to may more in my mind.

I have been reading on many websites and trying to find out the processes, terminology and what not - just to be stuck in reading but not doing anything.

Randian's who have managed to and/or doing it on there own, please put in your experiences and guides to do the needful.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

And then there is freelancing and creating your own product - for which what and what not's are not clear anywhere. because presumably you'd need trademark and stuff there too and you also need TAN and PAN and DIN and current accounts and etc.

What I am interested in creating my web based product, and deploying it and making money. problem is I don't know if it is actually that simple.

So I don't want to make it about myself. I'd like this to be for others too who might want to seek up similar help or who'd step on this path in future.

Please, help and post your knowledge and experiences.

Thanks!!! 🙏",cleanstart92," Pvt Ltd or LLP are indeed better than OPC, but if you're solo and don't want to involve anyone, it's better to go with OPC than a Proprietorship. In fact, unless you're taking outside investment or have more than one partner (i.e. yourself), I would even recommend to go for an OPC instead of a Pvt Ltd.

OPCs get treated like Pvt Ltds in all matters but don't have the same compliance burden. 

You're also overthinking this. Register a company (don't need dedicated office; just need address proof) first. Once that's done, talk to a CA about registering trademarks.

Also, this isn't shit you should be DIYing. Hire a CA. If you hope to be a founder, you'll have to delegate. Financial and compliance matters are not in your domain of expertise, so offload them to people who specialize in these things. Few of my inputs

1. **Don't incorporate a LLP or Company unless external reasons require you to do so.** They only add additional compliance expenses, closing them down is lengthy and expensive process and they provide no additional value. Forget what you read about limited liability you read online, this is India not USA.
2. **If you have to incorporate, create a LLP instead of OPC or Limited company.** Otherwise, if you end up making good money, it will be locked up in company account and a you can't withdraw without paying additional dividend tax. You can always convert a LLP to company if needed, but converting a company to LLP has lot of rules and waiting period.
3. **Hire a CA.** Don't do all legal stuff yourself.

&#x200B;

Finally, if you just want to make a web based product, do as proprietorship. Unless you start earning 5-10 lakhs a year, its useless to get involved in legal stuff.",2019-07-09 13:55:35

I am looking to buy a new bike that I can ride in city to work and occasionally go light touring (100-150km). 

Some aspects to consider:

Budget- Up to 1.6 Lakh

My height- 5ft 5in

Pillion has to be comfortable.

Any advice would be appreciated!!",nagasadhu," *""Budget- Up to 1.6 Lakh""*  
Did you specifically wrote that number for Randians?  


Also, Buy Dominar. Try Jawa. Waiting period is long though. Have you considered the Dominar? Will require stretching your budget by 30k though. A tourer's dream.

But do test ride it regardless. And check if local service centers have good reviews. I'll address all the recommendations in this thread with my opinion. I spent a lot of time researching bikes this year prior to my own purchase.

Duke 125/200 / MT15 - Do not have comfortable pillion seats. I had to throw them out of my head for that reason alone.

Dominar - Meets and maybe even exceeds expectation for the price, but is expensive.

FZ25 - A good machine overall, fits in your budget perfectly.

Apache RTR 200 - I own this. If your touring needs are that light, you'll find yourself more than satisfied. It's extremely fun (rev happy), has a comfortable pillion seat and a very satisfying power band. You'll save some money too.

FZv3/Hornet - They have significantly lower power numbers. The Hornet is also quite handsomely priced for what it is. They're not as *fun* to ride as the other motorcycles on this list, but are great for mileage and pillion comfort.

Get test rides and more importantly, **get dual channel ABS**. FZv3 or MT15 FZV3 or Honda Hornet. Exceeding the budget, could go for Dominar. Nothing apart from these three is even worth giving your time. Dominar, Apache 200 4v, Yamaha FZ 25, Gixxer, Gixxer SF Bajaj Avenger, do test ride it first.

Non-news should be a thing in today's world of instant news and instant shit. Sanity in this insane world that we've never imagined we'll ever be is non-news. And it should be yesterday because you've been through it and it's fresh in mind. I'll go first.

1. Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.
2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood. That once again reminded me of a video made by one History professor on Pigeons in US. In early 19^th century 
2. Yesterday I watched a video on retrograde motion of Mars ~~mercury (and also sun)~~ again after a very long time. This time around I really wondered what it takes to observe such a motion. 

    a. First, curiosity of what's out there in the space; instead of just ignoring because it's been always there and can be seen everyday.

    b. Keep seeing one specific part of space, notice a specific object in the sky

    c. Identify the same object the next day

    d. Notice that that specific object has shifted it's position in fucking space and not a coordinate plane.  mean, you've got to have much more than a photographic memory to keep track of location of an object in space

   e. This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.

    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.
   
4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time
5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.
6. All of a sudden Elpy mode is freezing my emacs. Need to find out why soon. I can't stand a monster memory guzzler Intellij.
7. Yesterday I bought 1KG really good tomatoes for 11 bucks.

I'll add any unremarkable, utterly boring, inconsequential events that I can recollect. Share your non-news and get back to your choice of slavery.",UUUU__UUUU," I overheard an old age aunty saying I love you to her husband. Made me smile.  After many many years, I just wandered around aimlessly on a two wheeler to explore surroundings last week. Found out there were 4-5 farms in 5km radius of my house, saw roads where they had good asphalt but nobody uses them, developed layouts with acres of empty land and a lot of cattle. It felt like a developed village with a dairy and old houses. There was a temple and outside a lot of old people sat to chat in the evening. I joined them and the chat went from their childhood stories to their oldage stories, their efforts and how you need to be a good person before a rich person.

It felt like I paused a day off my normal schedule and experienced something so small yet so beautiful.  Motu the dog barked for exactly 134 minutes straight last afternoon. Motu needs to stfu [deleted] A sweet Bhabhiji slipped down in the mud at bus stop yesterday morning. She was screaming at her son for being serious on exam day while the 7 year old bachcha was singing a song. I saw a dead cat yesterday. He was a stray but me and neighbours used to feed him.
RIP. Today morning I woke up  I am looking for a new job since people higher up the ladder blame the lowest pebble (me) for anything that goes wrong. My roommate got a job offer that pays more than his current manager's salary. We spent a while talking about the incompetent middle management at his current company and then went to the roof and had a few beers.

Also saw two kids popping wheelies on a beater 100cc bike. The second dude was almost hanging from the back in order to create enough leverage for the front wheel to stay up. I had deleted Ola app because of Rs.50 cancellation fee it slapped on me. But yesterday, I had to book Ola auto for my aunts. So, after a gap of almost 6 months, I re-installed Ola app and paid the damn fine (100 rupees) and booked Ola auto ride. [removed] After a long time, I went to skiing with my friends to Gulmarg. We stayed the night there and during sunset looking at those mighty Himalayas was one of the best sights I have seen till far by now.  A stray cat mom abandoned her 2 kitties in the building I stay. These kitties have settled to staying on the stairs and running up and down when someone uses the stairs. I ended up pitying them and kept milk and some cat food at my house doorsteps and they started to trust me. This was all cute and fun until they decided to play with our shoes, threw my nikes outside the building and shat all our entrance lol. Don't know how to respond to them now I am aiming to get my first job this summer. 
 After dropping my brother at the railway station yesterday, I went to the temple i used to go to every Tuesday with my mom. Felt good. Vultures are coming back. just saw 2 yesterday. such awesome birdies  Killer idea OP hope this becomes a thing (or a future website in which case HMU!)

A few days ago, my neighbour's plot caught fire. I thought it was intentionally done to clear the overgrowth. Such huge flames. I was cursing the mentality we have to use fire to clear our fields.

Later, I found out that the fire was accidental. However, the owner returned and found that since half the field was cleared, he might as well finish the job. Burned the rest off as well.

Supposedly, it's good for the soil and the ash can help the trees. What, 11 bucks for 1KG tomatoes? Its 20 bucks here.

Though I got 3 carrots and 2 small capsicums for 10 bucks, that was a good deal afaik.

 Man, now that you have mentioned donkeys, I don't remember seeing one in months :o.
Also, came across [this guy. ](https://i.imgur.com/oP180VO.jpg) Too fucking busy to notice anything other than desperation of elected officials

I saw more sign boards being posted on roadside in last week compared to last 5yrs.

MLA came to our society and asked if any work needs to be done

All roads r dug out because they r building new ones

A lot of dust on the road.

And not getting enough sleep, a family function this weekend so too busy I saw this and I like it. Quite relaxing to hear the small stuff that affects people. Puts into perspective the damage social media, 24x7 news, FOMO has done to us. A part of this world moves at lightning speed and another part moves leisurely. 1. Today, I finished my first ever new york times crossword after months and months of trying to do them. It was one of the greatest feelings and i celebrated by eating a vanilla ice cream. Had not had ice creams for ages before today afternoon.

2. There is a stray cat which roams around my building. I stay on the 5th floor. She comes up daily and just stares at me while i cook and clean. I want to adopt it but I am not entirely sure its a stray.

3. Yesterday, i saw house sparrows after A LONG LONG time. Decided to keep some grains of rice on my balcony. They have not noticed it yet. Hopefully, tomorrow. *Yesterday, I wanked all by myself...* Yesterday I learnt that my roommate has been a headache ever since and my flatmates actually want her out. 

I don't want to be a part of their petty war and it's been only 3 days since I moved out.

:/ Electricity department replaced a damaged light pole that was in middle of the street. The entire activity took about 3 hours with about 12 15 onlookers with special interest. By the way the truck bringing the new pole had a flat tire for no reason and had to be repaired. Visited my parents side of Hyderabad yesterday.

The constable who harassed my friends and I when we were younger has built a three story house with the bribes he collected. This is a gem of a thread. The saddest part is reading about the missing birds and animals. I am glad people are noticing. This should be a weekly thread

***Weekly Non-News of India*** The pig in my friend's backyard pooped lesser today Wow. Such a nice post. This should be weekly thing. Good going OP. :)

Also, yesterday, I finally picked up a pencil again after 2-3 weeks, to practice drawing. Not exactly yesterday (since I was traveling for the last 26 hours) but last week.

1. Visited Delhi for the first time. I've been to Delhi before but my time has always been spent either in the Metro or places close to the railway station.

2. Realized that a lot of the shops I used to eat at when I was a kid have been trying to modernize and have lost the old touch. I wanted to show off this old school shop where they made a big mug of lassi in a kulhad to my SO. However, the lassi doesn't taste the same anymore. Felt bad because it was an experience that I wanted to share but couldn't and that shop was a big part of my city experience growing up. My dad's phone got stolen some assholes snatch it off his hand. They were on a bike. Feelsbadman.

 Now I'll have to be careful too! Delhi ain't that safe even for men. :( Here is my non news: saw some post about an idiot talking garbage like he bought tomatoes for 11 bucks.

Seriously man WTF is this shit.",2019-02-22 12:20:19
AskIndia,[AskIndia] Is there an Indian equivalent of Hikikomori taking place in our society?,266,a7m150,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7m150/askindia_is_there_an_indian_equivalent_of/,130,"Hikikomori is a social phenomenon observed in Japan. It's a case of social withdrawal, where young people just stay indoors for years and years. They don't go out, or work (becoming NEETS - Not in Education, Employment, or Training), or socialize IRL. Their whole lives just revolve around the apartments they stay in (some alone, some with their parents).

Their reasons can vary - fear of societal disappointment, anxiety, depression, heartbreak, etc. It has much to do with the work culture of Japan, with its insanely long working hours, high expectations, conformity, and rigid social rules. I'd suggest reading about [Hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) and checking out some of the IAMAs done on it. And the anime, Welcome to the NHK.

**Now, the point: would you say that this is happening to some degree in India as well?**

Some of the factors that cause this are common here. Japan is very different from India so let's get past that bit. However, we do have similarities. Indians are [increasingly overworked](https://qz.com/india/1030594/indian-millennials-are-overworked-and-sick-of-office-politics/) with most of our workers [burning out](https://qz.com/india/1401250/indias-unhealthy-workforce-stands-in-the-way-of-economic-growth/) from unhealthy conditions. [Indians are lonely](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/india-obsession-with-sons-millions-of-lonely-men-after-dowry/7903134) and many millions will, statistically, die alone. This is not to count the actual problem that we have no dating culture in India, and the fact that most men are unlikely to be well-socialized with women - who then watch movies about romance and start to wonder why their lives don't match up with what's on screen. Indian male loneliness is crippling, and prevalent, in my opinion.

Like Japan, we also have strong family structures, so that an unemployed youth staying at home and slowly rotting away isn't uncommon. In fact, in Kerala, I would say every family has one. There are cousins and uncles - people who for unexplained reasons end up doing nothing but staying at home. We have people who strike out into depression after failing the IIT-JEEs and AIEEEs or back papers, who stay home and seldom if not never come out. I'm sure many have posted on this subreddit as well. 

**One strange parallel I feel we have with the Hikikomori is the IAS aspirant**. There is a degree of social isolation and staying-at-home-for-years that happens with both IAS aspirants and Hikikomori that really strikes me. OFC not all IAS aspirants are the same but I know one shut-in and one on his way to becoming one, perhaps. Anyway this is just my view.

What do you think, though? Are a lot of young Indians locking themselves away from society as well? Have you ever felt the urge? Any discussion appreciated. 

I write as someone who's been unemployed for a good year now and I can feel the yawning chasm of social reclusion approach. Most of my year was at home, though I took gaps to travel. This was more a recluse from my career than from socializing, though I do feel I've been meeting fewer new people than I normally do.

I do believe that his is happening, though quietly. In a country like ours, it's easy to be forgotten.",RagiModi," Damn, I didn't know that the thing I have been doing since long has a name!  ""beta to, aage ka kya socha hai?""

""kuch nhi aunty bas pani bhar jaaye to motor off ker dunga"" This is really good observation. I think it is bound to happen if it's not already happening.

Young educated Indians are facing a drastic mental pressure as soon as they're done with their studies.

And, Indian society is very structured and surprisingly united in holding on to its dogmas. While young people are still figuring out what's on their mind, they're buried under the societal shit of finding a 'suitable' job, marriage, giving their parents grandkids to play with, buying a vehicle, buying a house, etc. And before they'd realize what's on their mind, most of them would be no longer young.

Some young people cannot take it, they break away and become recluse. A few others, desperate to prove themselves to the society, follow mobs, become vandals and cause chaos. But most just suck it up. They learn to live with it. They grow up to either quell the dogmas or propagate them further. I only hope the former triumphs.

I'm sorry if that sounded depressing. I'd be happy if someone could change my mind. I have 0 friends for 3 years, no collage, coaching or job... 0 interaction with anyone except my family, go out once a week... 

Damn! Seems like have Hikikomori for 3 years... I've seen and studied cases where people get into that phase many a times because of medical reasons (like disorders and infectious disease). But it's sad how people become socially withdrawn because of external reasons like a bad breakup, loss of loved one and circumstances of situation. All it needs is a few words from those who care and give support throughout. 

**Solitude** is a state of isolation that is temporary. Like suddenly trying to stay home for a whole week binge watching series and not facing the sun. Some people end up there because of many reasons, and they've been through a lot of shit. Some fall in never to get up and feeling comfortable in a hole because its far better than the shitshow happening outside it. Our education is taking pride in making products (like engineers with MS and MBA in foreign Universities), judging on how much you earn and how rick you look. Nothing else. They have a very stupid yardstick just for judging. Help another guy? Fuck it. 

For dumb people who blame the internet for this, this is the ONLY safe space for many people. Unfortunately, those boxed up isolation chambers contains many hidden gems. There are thousands of Amazing DJs, Great artists, kick-ass gamers who feel its better to be anonymous, chatting with random persons across the globe rather than their own family, because the family is afraid of the society, the shameless society whose only wish is to screw others for fun. This might take generations to recover. But it will.

On a rather real note don't be afraid to open up, especially when you are alone. Ofc there are dumbfucks who might take advantage of it or even use you throughout. Learn your lessons. You'll end up with a few who'll hope for your betterment...Always. There's always people who would find it fun to talk to you and support you. I can be one if you wouldn't mind. My inbox is always open. Stay safe.

&#x200B; A big difference between Japan and India is that Japan is a 1st world country and most people can afford to keep their kids at home doing nothing without a significant change in their lifestyle.

In India, most people can not afford to support an adult without any benefits and parental push or hunger would force a person to work (or become a destitute).

However, in middle and upper middle-class households, I won't be surprised with a rise of Hikkikomori lifestyle. [deleted] [removed] Yes, shitty private college engineering. Holy Shit! Iam one of them. It has made a landfall on our large shitholes (metros) where traffic is where we see outside world (filled with strangers) and mobile is where we socialize. This daily routine coupled with work/studies/family pressure can make even a sane logical thinking person who sees no meaningful outcome with social interactions other than for greed and power go into social isolation. 
India with its growing middle class will be a Hikikomori warehouse in the near future.  Oh god YES!

I've been wanting to make a post like this for a long time. As a 22-year-old, I was probably part of the last generation (in India at least) of kids who spent most of their childhood outside playing/socializing than on digital screens.

I agree with your post, we absolutely have an invisible problem lurking just below the surface of our false outer facade of the 'demographic dividend' potential. We have an insane number of young people, with a super narrow set of opportunities, who're growing up in a culture that absolutely sucks at socializing, dating, and having conversations and [connection with even the fucking neighbors.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indians-in-gated-communities-meet-their-neighbors-online/2012/06/12/gJQAvjPfWV_story.html)

With the spread of the internet (not blaming it, it just catalyzes the worst aspects of the problem), I only see this problem getting worse. Most kids are growing up alone with barely any social skills, and without proper intervention, they'll go on to have terrible lives as adults, and as you noted -- die a lonely death.



 Add me. It's been two years.  Most married women in lower middle class...  [deleted] I live in Japan now and back in 2012-2013 I spent a good six months confined to my room at my parents house in India. I wasn’t unemployed though (I worked remotely), simply tired of people and the mundane routine that was my life. 

I know a few of my friends (in India) who quit their high paying jobs and decided to backpack across the country and live as a free spirit. (they don’t use cellphones). 

We all have our own coping mechanism to deal with life as we know it (mine was gaming and traveling around the world). 引きこもり is just one such way. Its not because of over work it could be anything that causes a person to believe life inside four walls is a better life. Some Hikikomori do work remotely. There are several manga artists, singers, and even developers I know who are Hikikomori but with a profession.  They’ll refuse to make public appearances or do video calls but happily work and text. 

Think of Hikikomori as someone on a house arrest but voluntarily. The house for them is a safe zone (psychologically speaking) where no harm would come to them both physically and mentally. 

You should watch https://youtu.be/wE1UIK85E3E which is a more accurate description of what it is than return to NHK. 

I also recommend these anime “No Game No Life”, “Eromanga sensei” and “re:Life” if you want to explore Hikikomori via anime subculture. 

Feel free to ask me anything you wish to know.  One category everyone of you missed - **unmarried, unemployed women** who have aged beyond what is commonly considered marrying age. Another category is divorced women. These two have existed in Indian culture since time immemorial. I know a few people in these categories. The fear of a girl entering this category is the main reason Indian relatives/parents pressurize girls to get married as soon as possible. Yeah I was one in my early to mid 20s. I only got out because of support of my parents. Though even now I feel detached from the narrow focus of the society around me, and often times struggle with motivation. The only thing that's constant for me is my love of my chosen field. I think it's happening. Not the exact phenomenon but we do have an Indian version of it. 

IT employees in metro cities and IAS aspirants are somewhat the same. It happens very slowly, most them don't even realize this; only after some mid-life crisis hits them. 

But as always, they are not to be blamed. They are the result of a broken system and societal pressures. The day is not far away, when we will see some of them call it quits and move to their native place again or look for a different career option. Despite the so called inclusive society, high levels of social isolation is very common in urban areas.

Nice post btw. For those of us reading from outside India, could you please explain what IAS is? 
Aside from that I think you've made a very well  articulated argument and although I only have a basic understanding of Indian social dynamics, I have spent a good amount of time in Japan and I can potentially see some similarities in the results although I believe the reasons are quite different. In India, the assurance of family support might be the cause despite people having genuine ambition (such as the the friend you've cited), whereas in Japan there seems to be a growing lack of ambition from the get-go. Young people are losing the desire to compete in society, possible for fear of failure. There is also a term for this in Japanese which translates along the lines of ""plant-eating boy"" and refers those young men who would rather stay home than take any risks at all (while being primarily used in the context of dating).  Yes. Mostly because of 2 reasons, the job market is fucked. So parents pressure kids into doing things they have no interest in and in the end it all goes wrong.

Now why is the job market fucked? Pretty sure there are jobs? Correct. The problem is not that there are no jobs. Let's explain with example.

A kid is provided with everything from phone to house to car because his or her parents worked hard and reached the level they are at. Now, the market is so screwed, a person on employment cannot build a decent house in a good area all his/her life. Kids are under pressure to achieve more than their parents because they assume ""my parents earned this, and it's not enough for me.. I gotta earn more"". So they are satisfied with jobs that pay less... but what parents dont usually tell their kids is that they also started with low paying jobs. My father started with 1200 rupees a month and earns 2 lakh a month now. Though it took all life. 

Kids expect they will start at 10 or 20k and then within 3 months it should double... dreams. And even if their parents tell them, they discard it by saying ""tab to sab kuch sata tha"". True it was cheap but their pay was low too? It's the same. 

So simply, these kids have had it all and dont think its necessary to earn because they wont enough for it to mean anything, so why not live on your parents money? And that is how they become shut-in.... that combined fear of judgement from society. 

Hope I could explain properly.  Social media also has it's share in contributing to the problem. It took me some time understanding how society and family influences your desires and what you want to pursue in life. Only a minority would achieve that kind of success early in life which would require talent, hardwork, motivation, ability to focus for long amounts of time and a bit of luck. When you disentangle from all those expectations, you feel light, you finally get to know yourself and what you want to pursue in life. You get to see your flaws in a non-judgemental way and start working on them at your own pace. 

Women's high dating standards in Japan also contributed to the problem. Most women there would prefer to stay single than to date/ marry a average looking/ earning guy. This resulted in men dropping from society. I can see this happening in our country in the very near future. No it will never happen in india in the same manner it happened in japan or not happened all together.

Our society is not made in a way to allow 'space' or too much personal  freedom That they can be separated from the society.  I never thought i would see a thread about being a Hikikomori in r/india but i would like to share my experience, so after i had given my ISC exam there was a long break in the duration before i appeared for JEE. So as usual during this time the pressure from my family to study to get a good collage was highest and also as i generally do not like to talk to people i got my full freedom to become a NEET like i didn't leave the floor i was on for 2 months and the experience was not very pleasant but liberating as I didn't have to face my family or so called friends.the duration of this was about 2-4 months but then collage happened and now i am rehabilitating into the society i still hate people and do not talk much but at least i am not a shut in now.  Pubground I stay indoors and enjoy my time alone.  Yep I do think Hikikomori is a thing in our country. I've been unemployed for a while now and the materialization of my ambitions hasn't happened yet, I'm studying hard and have confidence in myself but still I try to avoid socializing as much as possible, it just doesn't feel worth it. Exercising, junk food, netflix and studies is all I do and yet I do not feel as depressed as I should because even without achieving anything that matters in the real world, I have somehow accepted the fact that one day I will make something of myself. But I do fear the what-if scenarios where I couldn't do what I set out to do. The fear of failures is strong and we try to keep that fear locked in a box but the society keeps reminding you of that fear.  Now Hear my story I am a 25 year old  now, lets start when i was 18 year old, I was  a   ""Bindass type"" Guy but surrounded by wrong group of friends which they cheated on me thinking i am a ""Chutiya"", Friends used to take advantage of me so I liked a Girl but couldn't approach her and tell  that I like her but i didn't had that strength wasted 5 years of my life in that phase she went to Kerala for her medical career  and i left NIIT career course in mid way so couldn't complete it, was depressed and got lazy spending most of the time on the internet and playing video games,some times i had suicidal  thoughts but then i overcame it thinking its all a temporary feeling, I wanted to be a software developer after bcom completion in 2015 but i didn't had that motivational strength to do it and then i joined a company in 2016 and left it after 5 months due to pressure from seniors and for a period of 1 year i was mentally disturbed then in 2017 i joined a call center bpo worked for 5 months due to low salary and drug addicts and wrong crowd,i left the company on lunch break and for a period of 6 months i wasted  wandering what to do i wanted to go into software development but some astrologer told me that i will not have a career on technical field so didn't had that much motivation to do,later i went to  Kerala for a mid vacation and then  got a call from Accenture stating they wanna  hire me so i went for the interview in Mumbai for BPO process Insurance again not part of my interest and lot of pressure spent 8 months of working and later I Left it, then i watched a Documentry on Youtube of Hikkikomori people then i got to know thats what i am going through My career is totally fucked and crumbled now  i am fighting against my lethargy and trying all the best i can to get into Software development field. An insightful post after a long time on r/India. Thanks for sharing. [deleted] Too poor for that shit. Most men in India can't afford to sit only at home. They need to get out and work to get food. >many millions will, statistically, die alone.

Most people die alone. I don't know if it counts as half Hikikomori, but when I'm in engineering all I did is go to college and come to home. Sometimes I even didn't go to college for few weeks and stayed at home. 

I'm doing a job now. But it's same, office, home, zero interaction. 

I want to get rid of this habit but well still can't.  I came across this a while ago and quickly realized it is not just a Japanese phenomenon because I was able to relate to it so much. I quit three well paying jobs in past two years to stay at home and try to earn an income on my own, but haven't succeeded so far. Gave up soon and got a job the first two times, but now its been six months since I've been at home after quitting my last job. If only I can make a living by staying at home, I'll be a Hikikomori for life! :P Bro Idk what to do  Ive been a recluse myself for over 5 years.  Nah, Hakikomori completely different to what's happening in India. Indian job aspirants experience social isolation but they still have minimal interaction and goals, but it's nothing like being a NEET. Hikikomori is way too severe, like 5 years at average. Minimum 2 years to even consider yourself to be one. Also, there's Neetbux and money from their parents even at the age of 25-30, they also don't have any goals other than self pleasure, Indian parents rarely raise a 30 year old child. Hikikomori rarely get get out to the point that Agoraphobia. You can't compare Hikikomori to Indian isolation. Dont think Indian parents will let it get that bad. Take Indian social isolation and multiply it by 8000 times, then you get a hikikomori. Perhaps it had to do with the current job scenario in our country or may be not but I think it's a reflection of the educational system that focused too much on irrelevant things like IITJEE or leaving no other choice for students than Btech and such. Sad thing still being that parents are unable to accept the fact that engineering and related streams are saturated and its not a decision to be made by parents but rather its the teenager who should be capable enough to take a decision on their own.

And the work culture in India is starting to improve, at least in the IT world, with the start-ups popping up but it's gonna take a long time for those stubborn corporations to adapt to a better work environment.  It's very difficult to be a *hikikomori* in India because there are so many people and everybody wants to have something to do with you. Contrary to what you are saying, it's almost impossible to be forgotten because somebody will always ask about you or if they haven't seen you for a long time will just ask straight where you've been and what you're doing. Social isolation is probably the most difficult thing to achieve here. Being socially isolated assumes an individualist society which we haven't been able to build yet. For, me I am kind of a social recluse. But, not as bad as a Hikikomori as I have a job and I still go out to tea with my gang. I am trying to improve. Well done OP on putting forward a topic which is prevalent but isn't talked about much. It's just like several other problems which aren't considered as ""real"" problems in India. I feel it'll be a long time before Indians try solving it. They first need to recognize it as a problem.  Contrary to popular belief here, I think that the Indian culture that is rooted into me won't permit me to become a complete shut in not matter how low I fall. There is the added fear that parents would stop supporting altogether, not to mention the society pressure of doing something productive.

I do however agree that male loneliness is very much on the rise, but don't think that it will progress to the point where a considerable amount of people would become hikkis
 Fancy way of saying that I am have depression and anxiety  Ore NEET dattebayo! We get it, you saw a new anime. Antisocial behaviour/agoraphobia/depression/anxiety have been pretty common phenomena everywhere, not confined to Japan, they just gave it a different name. Our suicide rates are quite telling.",2018-12-19 20:36:38
AskIndia,[AskIndia] How do you keep yourself fit?,44,aq83ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aq83ya/askindia_how_do_you_keep_yourself_fit/,48,"What does your exercise routine look like? 

What are your short and long term fitness goals? 

What kind of diet do you follow? 

If you don't train then what's stopping you? 

Any fitness related achievement you want to share?

Edit: I am not seeking any advice here, I just want everyone to share their routines and spark a discussion so that people can ask questions to each other and learn. 

",LongDraft," I didn't realize the importance of deiting till I got into medschool.

Some tips:

 -You need 1g /kg body weight of protein to keep you fit everyday. So if your weight is 70kg eat 70g of protein everyday. 1 egg contains 6g of protein. If you're trying to lose weight, egg white : egg yolk ratio should be 2:1.
Soya beans , sprouts and lentils are good sources of protein. 


- Count your calories. If you're trying to loose weight eat less than your daily RDA. Google Indian RDA to check what's yours according to your weight. Approx. 2400 for males and 2000 for females. It's not rocket science , once you start counting and managing it'll become easier. 


-  Exercise? 

 I do warm up first followed by

 500 skips (60fast 40slow)

 70 burpees

 100 push ups 

They can be divided in sets of 3

 Abs workout

 
 And individual group of muscles (chest, back , shoulders etc)


- If you swim after that it's a bonus.

Try reading about High Intensity Interval training. 

- Drink lots of water and cut off sugar. Eat stuff like watermoln and cucumber it's low calorie, high fibre and keeps you hydrated. 


- Do something that makes you feel relaxed for me it's Swimming and Mediation (highly recommended, you should be fit mentally and physically)

Have patience it'll take atleast 3 months for you to notice chages. 

 If you just want to lose weight, don't exercise.
Just create a calorie deficit by eating less and moving more. (Moving includes regular walking and general activity)

If you want to get fit and build your body, you should take more protein, less carbs and workout more. Doing this will increase your hunger and appetite. So if you stop working out midway, there's a chance of gaining more weight and fat. 

So workout only if you can commit to your plan. Or else just eat less and create a calorie deficit to lose weight.  hit gym regularly. Initially you gain weight. But if you are regular you would tone up. Results will keep you going afterwards. 

Don’t diet, eat regular meals. reduce the quantity of carbohydrates (chapathi,rice) increase quantity of the sides (veg,meat) as much. eat seasonal fruits nothing fancy. 

drink water.


keep going!! Was never fat, cycle most days a week, play with a sponge ball in the terrace alone at night because I'm a loser, and that's how I keep my weight in check I walk 10k steps early in the morning in a nearby park. 

My weight has gone from 107.8kg to 96.4 kg in 3 months. My goal right now is to hit 70kg.

I count the calories in my food and ensure that there's a calorie deficit. I eat anything but stay within my calorie limit. For more info go to /r/loseit.  [deleted] **Exercise Routine**

Monday/Wednesday/Friday = bodyweight workouts sourced from the Recommended Routine from r/bodyweightfitness

Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday = different running workouts, between 3.5 and 10km incorporating sprints, fartlek running, easy runs etc.

I mix in yoga whenever I can remember to do some, and will sub in things like football, rock-climbing/bouldering etc whenever I can get a good group of friends together to go for this stuff.

I also make it a hard rule to always walk to where I'm going if it's a distance of less than 2.5km.

**Diet**

I don't follow a diet at all, beyond basic moderation. Try to stick to unprocessed food, but don't break my head over it. I enjoy cooking and baking and eating out wayyyy too much to let it stress me out; I do make sure I get at least 5 helpings of fruits/veggies a day, and eat a lot less rice. It also helps that I hardly ever drink (once in 6 months), and don't smoke.

**Short and Long-Term Fitness Goals**

Short-Term: maintain regularity (I've been working out using the above template for about 2.5 years now).

Long-Term: Achieve some of the more hardcore calisthenic movements/holds (human flags, iron cross, front lever, etc).

**Motivation**

My main motivations are to find an outlet for my stress/anxiety, and to maintain some level of control over my health.

I've always had issues with stress and anxiety, to the point of panic attacks, but working out (in conjunction with therapy) has helped that out a *lot* so knowing that helps me stay motivated whenever I feel like slacking off. 

Exercise to me is just a means to an end, the end being a motivated and healthy body with enough energy to help me get through the rest of my day/deal with my other life goals. So i'm not too fussed about perfecting my physique or going HAM on my diet. Accepting that has helped me be at peace with the fact that I might not be progressing nearly as fast as some of my friends who are more focused/dedicated. Exercise routine is to go to the gym 5 days a week for about 45 mins, each day for a separate body part. I start with legs and get it out of the way because its the most strenuous of the lot. Then I move on to chest, shoulders, back, arms.  


Short term fitness goal is actually to feel happy, I go for the dopamine rush more than anything. Long term, I hope to get away from being skinny fat to toning up a bit, nothing too extravagant  


Diet: I just don't keep eating till I'm full, and don't eat junk often. That should be more than enough for maintaining decent fitness. People recommending fancy diets have outlandish goals as well, I have no such plans.  


Achievement: Clothes fit better, I don't look like a scrawny teenager anymore, and I feel more confident in general. I’ve been following the r/nSuns program the last few months, and have experienced great results. 

I’ve also been keeping track of my diet, and overall, feel fitter and stronger by the day.  I mostly just do jogging after waking up and then some hanging exercises on the hanging bar followed by 50 pushups and 50 squats.  Guys Get a mi scale. This gives a wake up call to you. My body fat and Visceral levels are way above. We always have a positive self -image pg our bodies. 

The readings make me more aware of the food I am consuming . 
 Routine: 5/3/1 Boring but big, T-Nation challenge  https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/boring-but-big-3-month-challenge

So I don’t do the accessories there, only the main lifts. I accessorise using metallicadpa PPL with the pull lifts on Bench and OHP day, and push lifts on the active rest days with legs on the deadlift and squat day. 

Cardio 20 minutes on bench and ohp day, 30 minutes on ActiveRest and no cardio on leg day. 

Diet: I am currently eating around 2300kcal since I’m cutting. I go upto 3200 while bulking. My minimum aim is 200gms of protein. Eat 1kg chicken everyday, bulking or cutting. No whey or protein powders. Do take creatine and citrulline.Lots and lot of veggies, wheat bran for fibre. Sometimes I’ll do keto, so I’ll eat cauliflower otherwise it’s always rice (just convenient to cook and pack). 

Goals: Strength, strength and strength. Currently my stats are 192/160/105kgs on deadlift/squat/bench. Aim for end of year is 230/200/150 while keeping my weight same. Currently around 80kgs body weight at approx 16% body fat. Want to reach 12% at same weight (or maybe 2kgs lesser).

I have as little as 30-35 mins for gym so this really works for me. Leaves me sore.   


Also, I make sure I clock 30kms/week running.    
 I know a lot of people are asking you to eat healthy and control diet, but in India, that's next to impossible. The average meals at home/hostel/hotel are really lacking in nutrition, as they're mostly carbs.

After multiple attempts, I finally switched to Intermittent Fasting. Read up on it, it's an easy method and doesn't require you to to alter your lifestyle massively. Dropped 7 kilos in 2 months, along with basic workout - push-ups, pull-ups, and squash twice a week.

The thing is, you must try out every method, but find your own. Most gyaan people dish out is what worked for THEM. ",2019-02-14 00:07:33
AskIndia,[AskIndia] What is your mom's catchphrase?,57,ayfhee,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ayfhee/askindia_what_is_your_moms_catchphrase/,71,"Saw this question on askreddit, and wanted to see what the Indian responses would look like",Monkeyglue13," ""Kobe j boro hobe""
""When are you going to grow up?"" 'Jitna badha hora hain, utne sing arahe hain '  Aag laga de is phone ke Idk if it counts as a catchphrase, but ""look at [your cousin]"" followed by comparison du jour. I see it as amusing now when I'm older, but damn those comparisons drove me mad.  Tumse na ho payega beta, na padhai m hoshiyaar ho, na job mil rahi h, na hi tu kisi kaam k kaabil h aur girlfriend toh tere naseeb m h hi nhi.


Sad but bitter truth. *""Shaadi karle....""* In konkani.

""Kaale?awoichi hadaa soduun asai?""

""What? searching for your mom's bones/skeleton?""

Seeing it translated, sounds really creepy. But it's basically an expression for looking for something. Or if you are lost ij thought.

Don't know the origin though. Or why anyone ever came up with such an expression. Tujhe bahar padhne bhejke galti kar di Looking at me and Dad - it's like I'm raising two kids in this house!!!!  When you leave for college, I'll rent a room near your hostel so I can cook food for you.

This isn't said in some nice wholesome way, it's a threat, haha. Jo karna hai wo karo (Do whatever you want to do)
It's a definite NO wrapped under the thick layer of sarcasm ""Rukja chimta garam karke laa rahi hu agar badmaashi band nahi kari to"" 'Jo bi hota hai ache ke liye hota hai' 

Also less common

'Paise ki tension na lia kar' (I'm a masters student in USA, so money issues)
'har time sab khush ni hote' (She means that it's life you can't be happy all the time)

She's pretty wise, she's a Hindi teacher for ~40 years. “Chhaan”

Marathi for ‘great.” She uses it when i’m in a bad situation

“Aai bill bgarayla visarlo” (Mom I forgot to pay the bill)

“Chaan” #""FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE EAT YOUR BREAKFAST BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE HOW DIFFICULT CAN IT BE!?!""  ""TAANGAAN TODHKE HAATH MEY DEDUNGI!!!""

...yup Hyderabadi here... “Pata tha!” Uthh jaao, ab kitna soyega. Siyapa mukke tere is phone laptap da Teri aukat he nahi hai! 😢 ""Pankha bandh kar"" So jaa, warna Hastar aa jayega .. Not used now but she used to say this while wake me up for school ""Utho laal ab aankhe kholo, paani layi hun muh dholo""  Kyun ka koi jawab nahi hota You don't listen to anything I say.. Utho utho, muh haath dho, brush karo, padhne baitho

I heard this everyday when I was in school. Now I'm 30 and this phrase still haunts me. Sar par haath rakh ke kha meri kasam ""Achaaaaaaaaaa"" tari vastu thekana par rakh 

which translates to keep your stuff in the right place.  Pata nahi kya paap kiya tha jo ye mila *""Beta jab main mar jaungi na, toh yaad karoge.""*

Thats when I get all stiff and shy when she approaches to hug/pat/kiss me.  >In Kannada: 'Naale andre haale'

Translation: 'If you say tomorrow minns waste only' “Bindaas rehneka” I love you. ",2019-03-08 01:54:16
AskIndia,[AskIndia] What song is this ?,6,comakt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/comakt/askindia_what_song_is_this/,6,"Often when I think of home there is a particular Hindi pop a song plays in my head that was popular in the early 2003, the year I left home. I can recall only one line from the song and hum the tune of the same bit and nothing more. Over the years, I, for the life of me can't find the title of the track or singer. I've trawled through a several 2000s pop songs compilation on youtube, lyrics websites without much luck.

What I can remember: 

* **Genre**: Hindi pop song
* **Singer**: Male, lean and tall (at the time of filming)
* **Year**: 2003 or 2001 (A ""hit"" song during the month of CBSE board exam)
* **Lyrics**: (Not chorus) It goes by *kore kagaz ki tarah, adhoori (khali?) meri (hamari?) kahani hai* the next line is sung in the same tune. That is all I can recall. 
* **Music Video**: Filmed indoor with large open space, maybe just walls (dark) in an open field with no roof. Heavy wind blowing into the singer's face and all over the place (as you do). The singer wears sunglasses (totally unnecessary), dressed in black and he features in most of the video. He is stood in front of the car on occasions. The whole video has a dark blue hue and borderline black and white. 

That's all I can remember unfortunately. Frustratingly the song has been on the tip of my tongue for a fair few years and with every passing year it gets harder to bear the fact that I may die (not terminally ill) without ever being able to listen to this song once more. 

**TLDR**: Can't bear the fact I may never be able to find the song that reminds me of home and childhood memories.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] How is your Jio Gigafiber connection,9,bysss1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bysss1/askindia_how_is_your_jio_gigafiber_connection/,23,"Boyyo, the shittiest connection on planet Earth and it hasn't even been 24 hours of me using it. Leaving all the privacy concerns aside and various technical concerns aside like IPv4 to IPv6 migration (that has been covered in detail in a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/?st=jwpse9tu&sh=4ffb9a21) ), I want to delve into the more mundane or trivial shitty things that come along with Jio Giga connection  

1) what the hell is with the landline, how could anyone be stupid enough to connect the landline with the router, fuck i have to keep the modem switched on a 24*7 or no landline connectivity. these fucktards ever heard of overheating  

2) of course the landline connection is itself a pain in the ass. fucking takes too long between consecutive rings, one might think it even got disconnected after the first ring  

3) the shitty shitty whyphy, motherfucker i want to kill the salesman who said i would be getting 50-60 mbps, the speed that i get is even lower than their low speed data that should be around 1 mbps, fucker reminds me of the gprs/edge days which still might be faster because of low data requirement for the page  

4) the stupidest and tardiest customer service ever, first you have to wait a whoopass 20 fucking minutes on the phone listening to the fucking jio tone or whatever, if that doesn't fry your brains, then the customer service guy/gal will. they are the fucking most typical indian customer service guys you can imagine. For a moment I thought i was in the south park episode with customer support and the vr headset. If you have seen Kenny's and kanan's maa ki dal sketch, then this guy is even worse than kenny. the same guy is the customer support and the floor manager and the technical team and yet they don't know shit  

enough with rant, i had some question for my borthers who got baited  

 * if any jio gigafiber users have figured a workaround for the landline, do tell mate  
 * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  
 * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port  

edit: i mentioned port forwarding in the last line incorrectly, i wanted to know about upnp support on jio, cause  with most CGNAT enabled isps, asking for static ip's becomes costly, so i had been using upnp to seed which can be easily enabled on the modem webpage. previously i had been using airtel and they had this service, what is the case with jio?",darkknight42062," We haven't got Jio Gigafiber yet in our city. 

How much do you for it and what's the plan? I'm currently using local broadband service that provides 20 Mbps speed for unlimited data at annual price of Rs 5500 and I'm pretty satisfied with it. Been using it for 1.5 years and still haven't faced any major issue with the service. For the first point , it’s triple play so everything is done through the ONT. so no use trying to bad mouth them for the unique experience 

Second jio uses CGNAT so no port forwarding at all.you’ll need to buy static ip to do the same and no this is not unique .almost all Indian isps do the same . Rs 2500 ONT only has 2.4 GHz wifi so speed will be slow.",2019-06-10 11:14:44
AskIndia,"[AskIndia]South Indian Supporters of RSS, why do they believe in Hindutva?",24,awasht,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/awasht/askindiasouth_indian_supporters_of_rss_why_do/,101,"AFAIK Hindutva/RSS's idea of Nationalism stems from the European idea of Nationalism and not the Gandhian one. RSS hasn't adjusted its core ideology to be ethnically inclusive, instead it doubles down with Hindi as a National Language and a North Indian cultural soft power(TBF these issues always plagued the Central Govt but it feels like Hindutva ideology is adding jet fuel to the dormant embers of Hindi-Hindu Majoritarianism).

I find it baffling to see a lot of South Indians on Social Media vociferously supporting RSS. In a Hindi-Hindu Rastra they are ethnic minorities with second class status. And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India than they are towards non-Hindus. Which begs the question, why is there even a single South Indian Bhakt?

**On a Sidenote**: Has the Gandhian idea of India failed? Everything is so hyper&jingoistic these days. A mere mention of ethnic groups existing in India seems to trigger outrage&accusations of anti-nationalism. ",OmegaMaleX," South India is not a monolithic culture. 



Within TN post independence rationalist, and Tamil movements took root allowing little space for Hindutva politics of RSS or Hindu Mahasabha. Even congress's influence waned  after Kamaraj. DMK continued to propagate athiestic world view( unless electorally inconvenient) whereas AIADMK has always been ambivalent about religion. JJ was never overly athiestic. 

As rationalist politics and Tamil  pride politics got run  over by caste politics and welfare measures
, there are some pockets especially in the upper caste who want to wear their religion on their sleeves, and have also felt marginalized these many decades. Remember these were the 'villains'  in the Periyar and Anti caste movements. This minority is now turning towards hindutva.

 AIADMK becoming a BJP puppet, and  BJP's vast spending on PR and social media lends greater visibility as well.



Kerala is surprisingly conservative as a society. BJP has managed to infest a few pockets, and has piggy backed on the Sabarimala issue (after initially supporting entry of women). They have had  nearly no impact on electoral politics till now though.



Karnataka is the only state where BJP has been able to form a govt. 

Thing to note here is that unlike other southern states Karnataka was not administered as a single entity pre independence. Karnataka today is an amalgamation of Mysore kingdom, North Karnataka ( part of Bombay province) and other parts of Madras presidency. Though a common language and past empires ( Hoysala, Satavahana , Vijayanagar etc) united the territories within the state, a cohesive state consciousness and politics is yet to emerge in my opinion.  

Different parts of Karnataka have thier political heavyweights. Mysore region dominated by JD(S) with Congress second. NK Congress. Coastal Karnataka and Malnad is where BJP is strongest. In fact coastal areas have suffered from the poison of hatred filled saffron cultural goondaism ( remember Sri Ram Sene and the pink chaddi movement? ). 

Although there have been rationalist movements in the past, and rationalist literature has seen its hey  day, hindutva's appeal is mainly political except for pockets mentioned earlier. 

I have no clue about AP and TN Mainly because they only resonate with the ""Hindu"" part. To them Modi, RSS and bjp stand for ""Hindutva"" or ""Hinduism"" . Also a lot of the supporters mostly belong to upper caste Brahmins who feel Rss and BJP alone are a party worth voting for (never mind how they are actually treated) and see Congress as a ""non hindu/Muslim party"". [deleted] In South it's usually the upper castes who have this North culture(Hindi Sanskrit and cow) worshipping nature. For them native culture of their land is not their culture. If you ask some Tamil brahmins they will claim sanskrit is their mother tongue.

This also explains why Marathi brahmins have historically been pro Hindi and running the RSS instead of sticking to Marathi language.

How much this narrative affects the state politics is function of their population and influence.
That explains the clear irrelevance of this hindi-hindu ideology in TN and it's significance elsewhere  I think it's just hatred towards Muslims that drives them to RSS/hindutva.  Everyone votes based on caste lines. Even the upper caste people. Who will have a higher representation on social media.  [deleted] 1. Conversions and Other religions: By making them the strawmen.
2. Positive Image: Because they are projecting themselves as representatives/guardians of Hinduism. 
3. About Hindi: Local RSS functions in the local language but the love for Hindi comes from believing that English is not good for their culture. English education is how one becomes ""westernised"". They paint English as the destructive force. Gandhi kinda comes off as racist and undoubtedly casteist. He is a bad marker of moral behvaiour tbh.  [deleted] Wow, slow clap OP!

This discussion is petty at best. If anything, the RSS wants a United India, not a country further squabbling about who's from the North and what language they speak of. Nobody is imposing Hindi on South India, other than the imagination of people who are inherently racist. Believing that someone else is a racist makes the person a racist too. [removed] ""And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India""

Out of the loop on this. What has RSS said on Aryan/dravidian divide? Any references.  Faith and Country are two distinct things. History between the two religions has been pretty rough. One of them got the rough deal while the other got away easy and is now playing the victim. So this misappropriation will make every Hindu latch onto any organization that voices its support for them.  It's the TV. TV should have the same sort of warnings as on cigarette packs. A lot of southie right wing supporters are very badly educated if you look at it, the rest are clever and want to capitalize on a situation and extract some sort of political power from this stupidity.",2019-03-02 06:48:51

Did a aunty ask you ""beta when are you getting married? It's too late.. bring your mom a bahu!"" 🤣🤣 Superiority complex. Nobody wants to feel shit because their life is fucked up. So they will capitalize every opportunity in the name of ""wisdom"". It's a common defense mechanism for such people. Because 

1. They want to fuck up your life too.
2. They have nothing else to do.
3. Their own kids do not listen to them and they are depressed. [removed] [removed] I never understand this. How elders think it's right for them to give unsolicited advice, but when i gave unsolicited advice to them, they get offended. 🤷 Was having my breakfast on the go while waiting for my cab, an elderly lady stops, tells me without anyy greetings, beta zindagi me yaad rakhna kabhi aaj ke baad chaurahe ke beech khade hoke khana mat khana!
And mf just walks away????

How do i disable these pop up notifications  indians believe a person should get respect on basis of his age not for the person he is. youngesters are expected to respect them and elders are expected to guide youngsters and young one is expected to follow that advice. it's just social expectation from elders to give advice  Superiority complex, mixed with the fact that they have a sense of pride and entitlement, that only god knows where it comes from.

Just had 2 uncles I barely know lecture me about my future career plans, with incorrect information and textbook suggestions and just straight away told me all my future plans are shit and they know better, when they themselves are living a less than mediocre life. Kept staring at my shoes and taunting me how I'll earn the littlest amount of money get lost in brands (the only brand he named was Nike, cause he kept glancing at my shoes) and how after that I'll throw away my money and ruin my life.

So when you get this ""free ki advice"", just ""smile and nod boys, smile and nod."" You learn from experiences and they advice you not to take decisions that they took which fucked up their life. I guess cause Indian society is more family oriented compared to western societies which tend to be more individualistic. Eastern countries have historically had a more community/family based social dynamics , look at Japan, China , India etc or its just that they are looking out for someone they care about .  Everyone is clueless but we all want a better life. Doesn't matter if you listen to them or not. What does matter is YOU can show them a way to better life.  Speaking from their experiences. Hey man if you feel it's good advice follow it, if not let it slide. It's not like they keep nagging you. If they are in case just tell that ""mom told me not to listen to you"" Worked couple of times.  They have a lot of free time.  Shastron me ise muft ka gyaan pelna kaha Gaya hai. Every elder is an expert in every field. You give them some chai and they be discussing quantum mechanics with you.  10/10 You will do the same when you're *elder*. 

Listen to what they say, it's not necessary to accept all advise. They've the experience of whole lifetime, probably went to some real shit, some good shit, some terrible shit. I generally respect their opinion and concern

Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people.

What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Dear r/all please do take the time to know about the recent religious riots happening in the Capital city delhi /r/India",pking3," I don't think ""atheist"" or ""none"" is an option under the official column of religions in India. So if you are born in a Muslim family you'll forever be a Muslim, unless you convert to some other religion. There are officially no ""atheists"" in India. We need to change this and develop the atheist culture in India. Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?
Then He is not omnipotent.

Is He able, but not willing?
Then He is malevolent.

Is He both able and willing?
Then whence cometh evil?

Is He neither able nor willing?
Then why call Him God?

#Pure Comedy
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*~Father John Misty*  

The comedy of man starts like this  
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips  
And so Nature, she divines this alternative  
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever  greets us on the other end  
Is kind enough to fill us in  
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever   since  

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to   address  
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron     deficient  
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look    after the kids    
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this   thing its milk?  
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we   can switch  
It's hard not to fall in love with something so   helpless  
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this  

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy  
Just waiting until the part where they start to   believe  
They're at the center of everything  
And some all powerful being endowed this horror   show with meaning  

Oh, their religions are the best  
They worship themselves yet they're totally   obsessed  
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks,   these unbelievable outfits  
And they get terribly upset  
When you question their sacred texts  
Written by woman-hating epileptics  
 
Their languages just serve to confuse them  
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure  
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring  
And hand out prizes when someone patents the   cure  
Where did they find these goons they elected to   rule them?  
What makes these clowns they idolise so   remarkable?  
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new   gods   
So they can go on being godless animals  

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but   to believe  
Their horizons that just forever recede  
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a   prison of beliefs  
That they never ever have to leave  

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman   would conceive!  
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive   is the struggle to survive  
But the only thing that they request is something   to numb the pain with  
Until there's nothing human left  
Just random matter suspended in the dark  
I hate to say it, but each other's all we got Religion is the main cause of unrest in India. Religion is one intense fandom. [deleted] Religion is legalised madness

Edit: Thank you for the shining silver kind stranger. To all those parents and students who called Moral Science classes a sham, this is why we needed it. Religion is an expired product that has continued to stay. It should have been eradicated or died a while back but has not. If we as species have to reach next level then we need to get over religion. Any existing religion is like Superman, did wonders on paper but doesn't actually exists. “When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”

Questioner :  Kindly give a straight reply. Does god exist, or not? Yes, or no? If yes, how best to realize him in this life?

JK : ""If you examine very closely, you have created god. Right? In India there are about – I was told there are about 300,000 gods and more. (Laughs) You understand? Every local person has his own god.

So, sirs, we have created god. See the irony of it. Thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created. Which is, to worship oneself and call it god. You understand all this? – the better part of you is god. Right? I wonder if you understand this. First of all, let’s be clear. Have you created god? The local gods round the corner, or the local god in Rome, or in Tirupati, or wherever, you have created them, haven’t you? You are so very uncertain, aren’t you, so frightened. If you say we have created, then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that. Out of your fear you want security. Right? You want safety, you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid. You follow? So you create that, and then worship that. Just see what you are doing! Going to Tirupati and putting all your money in the bag – do you think gods want your money? Sir, look at it all. You have nothing to offer but money, garlands, prostrations, rituals. Right? You have nothing else to offer. Have you realised the tragedy of this, sirs?

If you love – not god, that’s very easy to love god because it is an abstraction, it has not much meaning. But if you love, that very love is god, that very love is sacred. You won’t go outside to look for god. You understand all this, sirs!

And the questioner wants to know if I believe in god. I don’t. Because god is something created by man. There is such a thing as eternity, which is to be outside of time. Right, sir? For that you must have a mind, a heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life. Right? From your vanity, your arrogance, your selfishness – you follow, sir? And we say, we are not capable of it, tell us what to do. You are back in the cycle, somebody to tell you what to do. Sir, you are in a jungle, you have to walk through it by yourself. Right? And for that you need vitality and vigour and strength. Not belief in god, in goodness – belief has no place where truth is concerned. Right?"" This post is pure gold!
Religion destroys humanity not build it. All cast system, racism, homophobia and misogynims have their roots in religion.
Just fuck religion and you'll bring out the best in humans!!

God is like that 'Baba' we use to scare kids with so they won't do anything that is denied. If you need divine  reward to do something good or you have fear if you do something bad something bad will happen I think your are a piece of shit. Just be kind to the people help them if you can and for the world sake stop protecting your religion. \*reads title\* : Ahhh , I see you are a man of culture as well It's really my imaginary friend is so much better than yours. We're not going to get blown out in a supernova, the sun's too little. Religion is a massive waste of time. It has outlived it's utility. This is why i believe in my made up God-

Dovah- A dragon from Skyrim I personally believe that religion is for those weak minded people who can't face the music and always need some kind of support (was one of them). There was this really nice quote from MIB- ""An individual is a smart person. Perfectly capable of making his own decisions, rational etc. but crowd on the other hand is violent, easy to provoke, and has nothing but a common herd mentality."" Now don't get me wrong. I do read sometime bits and pieces of religious text which are some really well thought out philosophical texts but let us be real. There always be a motherfucker who's gonna distort everything and use gullible people to support his own propaganda by exploiting their concept of belief. 

So preach father and preach it hard. Fucking hell fuck all religions. All they have ever done is divided us, and taken advantage of by opportunistic old politicians. And our childish adults should take as much blame for that. We’re literally standing on the verge of global environmental collapse with highest levels of inequality and unemployment with a massively flawed education system and all they can talk about is their mandirs and masjids with no regard for what the future generations would go through. This. This right here!! Fuckkk all religion!!!! The bane of mankind Not just religion, any ideology that overtakes your identity as a human being is dangerous.



Be it the religious wars that were fought, to the dictators who mass murdered people in keeping to their beliefs, everywhere people collectively stood behind an ideology that shadowed their human identity.



Don't believe in ideologies rather believe and hope that tomorrow when a mob of these a$$f##king c@@ts come to lynch you, there'll be atleast one amongst them questioning what he's doing and changes his mind about his beliefs.



Or if you are privileged enough, you could just live in harmony, clapping and cheering, watching while these c@@ts kill themselves. /S Remove religion from schools (prayers) and we have a chance at better future I am going through same frustration bro , where are the so called foking almighty God who are immortal , or are they the ones doing this, them fok them . 
 
Guys tell me one benefit in believing in religion ? Does it save u from these riots ? Which is happening in the name of it .
Does it make people disciplined? Then who are these goons who are Killing in the name of religion ? 

I guess it was just an fiction story written by a man , and later after centuries people started thinking it as thier past and that it was all real . Just imagine after centuries if somehow someone reads marvel comics or harry potter or any such fiction story and actually believe in them thinking it as real thing from past. 

 I wish people one day no longer believes in it . Man made god,not the other way around. [Religion is like a Penis](https://i.imgur.com/V4gTSiO.jpg) We can't ban religions but we should start banning religion backed schools / madarshas Fuck god. I’m better without it. All we are to them are just Paying FANBOYS of their poorly written ""SciFi franchise""...
  -Mr.R0bot(about religion) Wanted to gift an award, but i m poor ☹️. Very well written. I have the same ideology. Hope so people stop this mass brutality in the name of religion. It wouldn't have been a real problem if everyone minded their own bussiness. ""Nothing divides us except religion"" Are you sure about that..? 🤔 Religion is a way for humans to escape reality. It makes people feel as if they are part of something bigger. In reality they are nothing, and they cant accept that. Its way too easy to think they are part of god's plan rather than a blob of hydrocarbons.

Religion is just a theory that was believed for so long that when better theories which proved religion false came along people couldnt accept it. Wrong sub my man. Most in this sub are sensible enough to know this. Should probably post it somewhere where people are deluded. People who are using incendiary rhetoric and inciting violence to meet their agenda are not in this sub. The intricate reality of these cults are far more complex to find a universal solution(for now) than saying ""fuck all religion"" on the internet. Religions will fade away,it will take time though. Until then, it's what it is. If it wasn't for religion, it would be caste or nationalism....for some reason being a human isnt enough and we feel a need to form smaller communities      
Haven't come up with what a possible solution looks like but at the least it should include critical thinking in kids and stopping religious indoctrination There is no better way to make people who have no beef in the first place hate each other to the point of committing genocide than through religion. Religion, is just a flawed philosophy. There's is nothing special in it. Religion is a mental illness. Why on earth would want to associate with them? Blech. Let them kill each other and some day they’ll all be gone. https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190801-tomorrows-gods-what-is-the-future-of-religion

 Rest of the world fighting with coronavirus. Religion is the opium of the masses. Forget about the bloody Gods and listen to what I am telling you - Margery Tyrell A hallucinatic person said something about religion which made so much sense to me. 

""If I don't believe in my imagenary friend, why the hell should I believe in yours?"" ~ Elliot Anderson Good rant I could not agree more - my hats off to my Indian brothers and sisters in the struggle against the zealots Keep spreading the truth.  Let's turn all religions into mythology again. religion was invented by smart rulers to control dumb people, and its something that's sadly never going to change. when you teach a child something, the older they get the harder it is for you to change their mind, and when they have kids of their own they teach them the same thing and it becomes an amplification loop. we live in a world where people take incredible luxuries for granted because thats what we're born with. the modern world allows dumb people to be loud and grab the attention of other dumb people who think the same, something that was never possible before. for god's sake just look at all the anti science movements, you can calculate the speed of light using a microwave and a chocolate bar but if they don't believe it it doesn't exist. people who think this way dont want to know the truth, they want what they think is the truth to be the truth and when that line of thinking combines with conflicting opinions all hell breaks loose. Careful not to cut yourself on all that edge. Disclaimer first: I am 100% an atheist.

Having said that, the problem isn't religion in and of itself.

Most religious teachings usually boil down to 'care about others' and 'be a decent person'. Yes, there's a lot of fucked up stuff in the texts as well, not denying that. But a lot of people find comfort and strength in their beliefs, and you saying they should just let go of it because it's illogical and dumb, is frankly as intolerant as religious fanatics. Religion also does not have to be at odds with science and learning. I remember asking a religion teacher in school which is correct: The Big Bang or God made the world. She told me 'Both. The Big Bang happened, but God made it happen (obvs not something I believe, but not the point is) She also reiterated that the Bible is not literal. And she was a nun. And, as you may have heard, Einstein believed in God too. So, again, it's possible for both religion and scientific knowledge to coexist.

Organised religion is absolutely a problem. In my transition from Roman Catholic to atheist, I had a 'I believe in God, but not in the Church' phase. Religious organisations can be corrupt to the core. People twisting scriptures and teachings to suit their own agendas of hate and power are a problem. People using religion to support ignorance and prejudice that harms others (like being against the LGBTQ community, or anti vaxxers, or sects who believe medical intervention should not be allowed) are a problem. But religious people who use religion to find personal comfort, help others, and be part of a community? There is nothing wrong with that.

Yes, I still believe the world would be better off without religion, because of all of the people who exploit it and do so much harm in its name. But it is not my, or your, or anyone's place to dictate to someone what they should or should not believe in if they are not harming you in any way and just living their life peacefully. Because, again, if you do this, it makes you no better than religious nuts who want to dictate how we live our lives. Amen Stop talking sense. true fuck religion Thank god I'm an atheist. Yes, all religions are fairy tales. Yes, no religion has any definitive proof of being true.

But there is one point people here are missing. Religion does give people mental peace and a purpose to live especially when things are not going their way. While it gives people a false sense of hope that makes them believe that things will get better, it does keep them resilient during tough times. People want easy answers to questions and religion gives it to them. We may be rational in thinking that we can embrace tough times by just moving forward and waiting for things to become better but others are not. They can easily get depressed and go through mental problems.

People who derive pride from their religion go too far. To solve that they need to be educated and given fulfilling work. This won't stop them from being religious but it will at least give them a genuine reason to be proud.

If you want to do away with religion you need to first solve mental health problems.

Just my 2 cents. Exactly. And fuck nationalism. None of us chose these lives/bodies that we are living in. Neither did the person you hate, choose this life for himself

Borders were created by us and it’s something very abstract. Fighting and killing others for something like this seems very stupid to me.

Then I would like to measure several parameters gdp, income, freedom of speech, etc. 

I am really curious what the results will be. It's always been a way to control people. It can be argued that it brought many people together in the good ol' days. The world wasn't so much connected back then. Your entire life would be spent in a 10km radius where it would be rare to find someone who believes in a different imaginary being. So it brought everyone together by believing things larger than themselves.

But the in last century, since everyone is so connected, finding a person who believes in some other imaginary being is too easy. And that's where the human group psychology acts against us and forms groups. It becomes Us vs Them. Religion is unnecessary in our society. But I don't think it should be irradiated or banned.

I think the ideal way to deal with this would be to just keep what metaphysical thing you believe in to yourself. Yes This is why THANOS was right! Wait till you hear about capitalism classism Imagine being an adult who holds faith in their omnipotent imaginary friend as described in a thrice-translated collection of oral histories collected over 1500 years ago, regarding events that happened hundreds of years before they were written down.

You know, the Inuit believe that the earth was created by Raven. The difference: I know ravens exist. Post this on a chintu sub and witness the dislikes Yesss fuck them. Fuck all of them. Every fucking government form I've ever filled asks for my religion. Be it university or a public sector job. I despise the idea that my belief system is somehow relevant to my performance as a student or as an employee. I make it a point to write ""n/a"" in that section, no matter what the repercussions. 

Iirc once a public college even asked my caste. Ffs my caste, and no, not from reservation point of view, just under personal information. Religion is nothing but a tool to control a large number of people by the people in power or those who pretend to be the representative of the religion.
It was used by hitler to justify the heinous crime even tho no sane mind would agree this level of torture for a fellow human.it was used by evangelist Christian Europeans who plundered lands of other n descredited their culture along with subjecting them to discrimination.It was used by isis fighter who were so islamic that they made burkha mandatory for all woman in their area n came with motto to defend islam but themselves raped in every village they went n even killing fellow muslims.it is now being used by the  rss n bjp to polarise the people n antagonize the whole muslim community on pretext of ages old of their own made up history n encouraging lynchings through bajrang dals ,inciting violence.it is still being used by few godmen who even with rape charges against them n property worth of 100s of crore people support them blindly n anybody even dare to criticize them is declared the enemy of the whole community. I feel you man, Im gonna start college this year and am really afraid to go to Delhi to study, all it would take is one person to accuse someone of being a Hindu or a Muslim for a bloodbath that to start that police will probably ignore I truly believe in the not too distant future that the belief of religion will be classified as a mental illness. It’s CRAZY to me that when you go back and read some of the different religious texts it’s chock full of holes and usually rely on “prophets” speaking/ having visions of *insert deity here* to get the message across. That shit sounds like textbook schizophrenia but because no one knew what that was they just accepted it as truth. Now here we are thousands of years later, millions killed in the name of religion and people STILL BELIEVE THIS BULLSHIT. *sorts by controversial,* *grabs popcorn* A fellow atheist popping in,

As I've said before, if God does exist, he doesnt deserve our worship because of the unnecessary suffering this donkey allows in his name or without. God, either shape up and help, or fuck the right off. Religion is like having a dick. It's fine to have one, but it's NOT ok to shove into other people especially children. I'm agnostic, and dislike all religions, but this reads like it belongs to r/iamverysmart. Or r/iam14andthisisdeep Let's get this straight, there are a lot of things that divide us other than religion. It is in our nature to do it. 

Religion is not bad. It's believing that your religion is better than all the others, or your god is superior to the other gods is what is the problem. I am not religious and I agree with you on most points. I want to believe that the abolishment of all religions is the answer to most of the problems of humanity. But, here is a thought. What about the countries with the most non-religious people? China, Czech, UK... Can we really say they are perfect? China has 90% of people who are non-believers. Can we really say they are in a better state than us?

Religion is a problem. But maybe the bigger problem is basic human nature which is to be selfish and divisive. Yes buddy the problem is religion. Not corruption, theft, incompetence, maladministration, colonial laws, red tape, power cuts, absence of health care, undrinkable water, no water, rabies, typhoid, malaria, dengue, PM10, unlivable cities, unsustainable cost of living, ridiculous salaries, sewage in the water, inability of the state and judicial system to catch or punish any kind of criminal at any level, all of which lead to the majority of people living in a permanent state of despair. No, the only problem is religion. Let's get rid of that and everything will be perfect. Great solution. Of course you are right. Nice work. Now go cure cancer b***d. If God does exist, he is having a laughing riot now. 

And yeah, fuck religion. Bruh so edgy, wow. Fuck Christian
Christian: Well, Hello. “If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time **we got rid of Him.**” -- james baldwin. ""Faith in God is the purposeful *suspension* of critical thinking"" - Bill Maher Also... Fuck Moash I do not believe in any god whatsoever,but I do believe that if people want to,they should.
If something provides them with an anchor,a sense of relief,then why force them out of it?
But of course,I 100% agree with your point of mass killings due to religion,and I'd also like to add to it that the concept of religion has been a major hindrance in our development as well.
All in all I'm just saying if people want to practice religion,they should,but,they should be accepting of other religions and learn to live in peace. I do not believe in this modern world commercial religion shit and have distanced myself from religion since 15 years now.
The thing is, it doesn't matter in India.
I used to live in Gurgaon, and was asked my name numerous times (even in front of my house) by random people who then started fighting(non verbal fights) with me just because its a persian name. 
I live in Toronto now, and noone gives a shit about your religion here (unless you decide to live in Indian/pakistani/bangladeshi ghettos again).
The thing is, it doesn't matter what your faith or philosophy is, when the crowd of fanatics comes at your door, they will kill you. There is no reason with these people, and to be honest its more related to the wealth gap between rich and poor. The poor have rage in them, they have cell phones with cheap internet and big families with nothing to do, so in their mind, power is in numbers and force is only way to get things done.
Seriously fuck this society.
Edit:word Lol looks like somebody just figured it out No matter how peaceful your religion is, the world will never be in peace with religion in it. Religion is the most dangerous disease, weapon and mental illness in this world. The main cause behind most wars, look at world war II, Nazis were predominantly Christians.... Hated Jews for killing their Lord... Thank you for this post. r/redditmoment My opinion on religion?
It was created to control the people. While watching the Hindu nationalists go insane in India this is all I can think about. We have to kill religion. Pakistani here.

We really are in shock over what has started happening.
We send our thoughts and prayers for all of you.

I'm already an athiest who promotes humanity more than anything. 
All religions tell you to do better to gods or entities creation first. This is just ungodly and non human violence.

I hope this ends soon. I hope people get out safe One day religion will die off and humanity will be free from its lies. Religion is the biggest con ever Finally someone who makes sense. I also agree that the religion and the caste system is absolute bullshit Here is the really amazing speech from Mr.Robot questioning religion.


""Is that what God does? He helps? Tell me, why didn't God help my innocent friend who died for no reason while the guilty ran free? 

Okay. Fine. Forget the one offs. How about the countless wars declared in his name? 

Okay. Fine. Let's skip the random, meaningless murder for a second, shall we? How about the racist, sexist, phobia soup we've all been drowning in because of him?

And I'm not just talking about Jesus. I'm talking about all organized religion. Exclusive groups created to manage control. A dealer getting people hooked on the drug of hope. His followers, nothing but addicts who want their hit of bullshit to keep their dopamine of ignorance. 

Addicts. Afraid to believe the truth. That there's no order. There's no power. That all religions are just metastasizing mind worms, meant to divide us so it's easier to rule us by the charlatans that wanna run us. All we are to them are paying fanboys of their poorly-written sci-fi franchise. If I don't listen to my imaginary friend, why the fuck should I listen to yours? People think their worship's some key to happiness. That's just how he owns you. Even I'm not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality. So fuck God. He's not a good enough scapegoat for me.""

- Elliot Alderson (Mr.Robot Season 2 Episode 3) I agree.

My parents(Hindus) always said that I must pray to God every day and shit like that but honestly, I didn't think there was any sense in that. Even in my school assemblies when everyone would vow their heads in prayer(I went to a Christian school) I would just stand there with my head up. I never felt that there was any use of prayer. Amen I'm 17 y/o and I am sure I can live without your fairytale. Call it bragging but I'm just gonna go ahead and consider myself much better than majority of adult population. I am also a vegan. I have questioned my life far and wide and I think everyone should go through the process of self evaluation. 
Please do it. Do it for us. The future generations. this entire thread is a huge r/redditmoment lmao Religion makes many people look at eachother as sub humans. We dont matter in the grand scheme of things but it is worth it to be good to eachother to protect the little we have. Religion causes so much pain and harm to innocent families. I don't hate religious people at all. I understand WHY some people believe but its just a fact the world would be a better place without it. Even Satanists? 

https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/tenets Atheists are just people who admit we don't know how the universe works but we believe scientists  are closer to the answers to the universe than the priests are. I've never understood the mental gymnastics some of you religious apes use to justify your beliefs. I have highly educated intelligent family members who believe in all the fucking cultural pseudoscience. 

Atheism isn't a choice, it's a symptom of a functioning brain. Amazing. Tell others to be open minded. Then ask them to live exactly the way you want them too. 



Fuck you too Valid points. But my religion has helped me become a better person, treat others with respect regardless of their religion and the colour of their skin, give charity, be a productive member of the society and most of all it gives me hope.

The problem is not religion, its extremism. Religious people are literally patients of a brainwashing cult that has incepted 'anti-human' idea and tradition in their brain All right it's time to address the usual rebuttals.

""We need Religion for emotional and spiritual values""

You can hire a therapist for emotional support and simply buy a good telescope to look at the night sky, nothing is more spiritual than gazing at a clear night sky.

""In 20th century more people died by Nazis and commies who were atheists""

Nazis were not atheists, they were Christians who traditionally hated Jews (even the Protestants hate Jews, just look into Martin Luther's verses). Communists were atheists but weren't just entirely atheists. Its the classic saying, a communist can be an atheist but not all atheists are communist (especially proletarian dictatorship).

""You cannot ignore the good things that religious people do.""

You can do good things without being religious, there's this thing called humanity you know. 

""Being an atheist doesn't mean you're a good person""

Precisely the point, atheism is simply an absence of belief in a God and doesn't explain anything about a person's political or social inclinations. There were and are many bad atheists but unlike theist folks an atheist doesn't need to defend that evil person merely because they share that one specific philosophy.

""You cannot just remove religion like it does nothing""

That's true, religion does offer many good things. But as I said earlier, you can offer all those good things without invoking an omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient God.

""Atheists are just too arrogant""

Theists claim to know the mind of the omnipotent being which created this entire universe and yet atheists are the arrogant ones... Right.

""Religion and atheism are incompatible""

Not entirely true, it depends on one's definition of religion. If a religion doesn't need a God as a criterion then technically you can be an atheist and be part of a religion. Again atheism only means the absence of belief in a God, nothing more nothing less. Amen I think we're stuck between a fake left wing that just wants to appease minorities and a rightwing that wants to install a tyranny of the majority. When the constitution clearly wants us to put aside the religious differences and want common good for everyone, I don't think, we, people are not ready yet to think in such higher terms. After all these years since we said our good byes to British, we only inherited the golden divide and rule policy to keep people invested in their religious sentiments and derive political and economic returns from them. I don't see a near future where people can see through shit and have a true democracy. It's sad, but it's also a painful truth. Chinese are atheists and look at their treatment of Uighurs, Tibetans, Hongkong, Taiwan etc... Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people by marx Well you know what they say: religion is the opium of the masses. I personally vibe the concept of faith and I can definitely see why people would be drawn to a belief, be it imaginary or not to sustain thoughts of afterlife and a greater existence. However, I hate the concept of religion as an institution. Religion has become an institution to control and generate profits and set its own agenda. Its an archaic institution that isn’t needed in the 21st century ʻOumuamua, take me away from this planet You should check out anti-theism. Btw totally agreeing with every single letter. I couldn't say it any better then this. Fuck Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and their other spin offs. YES PLEASE If you don't want to accept death, that's fine. Focus your efforts on achieving immortality. Decide that you will live forever or die trying.

But don't be dumb enough to believe in something that doesn't translate whatsoever to reality. Most people on here would already be atheists so there's no point preaching but just want to say that the world has far more to offer than religion will have you belief and this isn't some short trip in a grand journey. This *is* the grand journey. Do good without thinking of consequences and without shedding blood for any divine powers.

 If there are just gods then they would be pleased with you.

 If there are no gods then you have made the world a little better nonetheless. 

If your gods are displeased because you didn't worship and slaughter for them, then they are petty and cruel and not worthy of being called gods anyway. I can't explain how similar I feel with your thoughts Amen to that Yea exactly I think India should have a religion or no religion column 
Join r/atheismindia Wow i have always been a closeted agnostic. Didn't think there were many people in india with the same mindset. On seeing the reaction and comments here i am relieved. Hey look, an atheist on reddit! Up next, a bigot from BJP! So true
Take my fucking upvote. You only realized this now. Religion is the best tools for power mongers and you know it's another use, yeah you guessed it right, fool the foolish flock. That's the irony of religion   
Long long ago people settled in groups, made their own cultures, lifestyles and called it as religion to bring them closer.   
Now, the same religion is being used to make people apart!   
Sad part is, many can't see it. Religion is the opiate of the masses - Aristotle  maybe Religion is just some really good fiction with a very toxic fanbase I hear you. Also eloquently expressed by [Carl Sagan in The Pale Blue Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g) Finally the post I was waiting for..
Looks like people are starting to realize the true evil are the religion. I am getting out of these things lately. Religion at best are just fandoms and should not be given any importance in real life situations. Fuck all Humans, worst beings on earth! I have to say I like the singing and the dancing, from whatever religion, but for the rest I completely agree. Religion imo is nothing but a **MASS CONTROL**. People do not fucking respect religion, we are fucking scared from it. Human itself is the scourge of humanity. I have seen the good and bad things religions can do to people. So I see your point but not necessarily. Couldn't agree with you more! Im not that religious anyways, and you seem to have a good point. Religion is the main cause of unrest here, and if people don’t pay so much attention to it, the unrest might stop. Human...is above all religion...Lets practice humanity & co-exist in harmony & make the world  a better place I see, you are a man of ~~culture~~ intelligence as well.

Edit: I've had my share of  participation in atheist groups on the net. Sadly most of them are filled with people who don't know the difference between atheism and agnosticism. r/atheism Religion were made to bring people together in harmony, to share each other's thoughts, to help others out in need of help, but lately due to sheer greed of basic human nature. Religion has become a tool to control the masses and incite hate and violence against others who don't follow same ideology. nice post thanks for sharing George Carlin always had it right - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE) Everyday I'm constantly reminded that 'prayers' are the single most useless invention of humankind. There is only one god : Time I see that you're a man of logic OP. Just joined, happy to see more people with common sense :3 The only thing religion does anymore is give us more artificial reasons to divide ourselves into tribes and hate each other. Couldn't agree more. Amen to that [Relevant Mr robot monologue](https://youtu.be/NCe8NUK4BjQ) Death to all fanatics! ""Hey if you read history, God is one of the leading causes of death, has been for thousands of years"" - George Carlin I hate it more than you all do. Lol. Cheers Fuck Atheism! How do you feel now? This is exactly how people with religious belief feel after reading this. [I am a athiest myself] Dude just the first 2 sentences were enough I'm Hindu. I chill with my gods and I am with you a 100%. It's not about being from a certain religion. It's about an individual's willingness to not take himself so fucking seriously, sit down, and contemplate his mad life. Who else have watched Man from the Earth.. Religion is how you can trick people into giving you their life.  Religion is the tool used to exploit the masses.  ""Don't worry, this life is just a test run.  Actually, the more you suffer in this life, the more god loves you- the more he can hook it up in the next life.""  Now give me tax free money, please.  Bonus points if you slay some infidel. I have pretty strong feelings about orgasm. Maybe thats what life is about - perpetual orgasm. Religion used to bring people together back in the ancient times to a common mindset so that they can be together, trust each other and work and discover & invent new things and develop various technologies. It used to unite people for greater things. But nowadays the amount of toxicity and hate spreading through religion is immense. Religion is dividing people than brigining them together.
Kinda ironic to its original purpose. What about Dudeism? Didn't know there's a sub for Indian atheists lol. I'm a fan of Indian atheists fb page. They call out all relegion equally, but ppl also get triggered when they oppose NRC and CAB, it amazes brahmin Bhakths don't understand they are standing up agsint discrimination not standing up for a relegion
.

Also why is that our mythology of gods only ever mention animals that exists today? Why isn't there a god with Dino as his vehicle? Coz they didn't dig deep enough to find one and ppl who made yo these back then didn't even know about pre historic animals. Think to yourself........... ""When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a Religion.""

Robert M. Pirsig I love u Yeah FUCK all religions. People dying over made-up stuff: Very Clever But what currently happening in India is Fascism using Religion masks to divide people.




Yup. The good ol' 'Divide and Conquer'. ""Doubt is the highest form of intelligence"" Religion should have no place in politics All religions are man-made and man is the effigy of mistakes. 

&#x200B;

Hit ^(Up-vote) if you agree the statement! Here here! Thank ""**GOD**"" someone stepped up and spoken the truth, the truth which matters the most in today's modern world.

You deserve every upvote on this post. As Geroge Carlin said the best and I quote - ""Idiots fighting trying to prove to eachother, whose imaginary friend has a bigger dick"". I’m not sure if atheism is the only way. It is a good way to focus on the grand scheme of things, but religion isn’t inherently wrong. I believe it changes are a result of technological advancement. While abandoning religion would work, ‘rebooting’ a religion could also work. I only say this because religions actually never invoke any violence. It’s the understanding of the people who practice it. Granted both are equally hard, but consider a religion such as the religious society of friends. They are a good example of how well religion can affect a society. If we educated people, and had them either further educate or cut ties with people who have immoral concepts, things would improve as well. Not shitting on your opinion. Just giving my two cents. I'll just give my 2 paise:

Religion is a meme. No, not in an Advice Animal kind of way, but if you go by the original meaning of a meme, it is an idea that compels people to propagate it. In this a meme behaves like an organism such as a virus. Thus, religion is a meme.

Another point to support this is that **religion does not exist without people**. Religion NEEDS people to survive, without people religion cannot exist. Therefore, people are more important than religion because people came first. Religion wholly exists in the minds of people, it is not a tangible thing.

1 paisa more: Religion does not only mean belief in some god, IMO even Nationalism and Patriotism can be religions in their own right. Although I agree, heres a clip of [Joe Rogan talking to Physicist Brian Greene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpStPNAB7Cw) on the actual purpose of Religion. Very interesting take and I agree with him too. But most people take their religions very literally. Would you like to join the church of shrek? ""In this world, good people will do good things and bad people will do bad things, but for a good man to do bad things, it takes religion."" I became an athiest due to a few reason but mainly because of eiliot's talk on religion which stuck with me for years, I introspected on it never found a contradiction so I quit believing in my religion. There are a lot more reasons but still.



One of the lines he said was

""Religion is nothing but a poorly written sci-fi franchise that we are huge fan boys of""


""Why are wars fought in his name if peace is what he desires""


The best one

""God is a drug and we are the addicts."" Amen I read a book by Jack Donovan, The Way of Men.

In the book he said that it's man's primal desire to belong to a group, to be a part of something greater than himself.

The teens, and young adults that you see rioting on the streets are fulfilling their desire to belong to something, to fight for something, to stand shoulder to shoulder with fellow men. Everything else is a superficial excuse to act on that instinct.

When you have a large population of uneducated people devoid of critical thinking abilities, they are pretty much zombies acting on instinct and very shallow reasoning, which is evident when you hear those arsonists talk. These people are the pawns, unknowning and unpaid mercenaries of anyone smart enough to rally them. The universe is 13.7 billion years old, the earth only 4.4 billion. What was god doing during those 9 billion years. Also, when we finally get to Mars and other star systems maybe in the future, how will we get to heaven? Where is heaven? Can we go faster than the speed of light going from the other star system to go back to earth and go into heaven of hell? God is fake and made up, evolution is real  and we will all die. Eventually our planet will be unbearable for human life as we know it. Amen to this PREACH!! Op: Babe, can we smash?
OP’s gf: No, I’m waiting til marriage
Op: “Fuck all religion. It’s bullshit” You have successfully summarised the trimmings of your education, and preserved this moment in time. I’m excited for you, not many people get to develop further and then be able to point back to the moment they were so very wrong. I appreciate the effort though, as I used to believe what you have written, so it’s a clear view onto my past self. Well articulated! If I may throw you a crumb of comfort, life would be boring if we had all the answers, so in the future when you read these words again, you may wonder, as I do now, the vast learning opportunities that remain. Is this by any chance in context to the current political situation in India.

Because if it is then it would seem like a very irresponsible thing to project onto social media. Like an ""all lives matter"" kind of argument.

e.g. Saying the same thing in a country where atheists are being prosecuted or where people stigmatized atheists is a noble and brave thing but saying the same thing in China would mean siding with thier current regimes inhumane persecution and rounding of of Muslims in concentration camps)
Not to mention feeding into thier weird obsession with Tibet and who the next Dalai lama should be.

Imagine a Pakistani saying fuck Hinduism and fuck Islam while a hindu village is burned by mullah led mobs. Blaming the oppressor doesn't have to mean you blame the victim as well, and as much as you probably don't mean it that way, in the current context it **seems** a lot like that.

PS: if you're going to bring in the fact that it's not just Hindus attacking Muslims but the opposite as well, I'd want to invite you to remember it's starts in the broader context of the CAA-NRC under which it's fairly obvious who's going to be suffering. r/atheism So I have to ask what's happening in India that got this guy so riled up against religion? Glad that you've out grown religion 👍 This post is GOLD! I totally agree with you All religions are fantasy like Harry Potter but let’s be honest, not all religions are the same, some are worse than others when it comes to coexisting.  
Some Christians and Muslims believe every word in their fantasy book and are influenced by it to hate those who aren’t like them or are homosexuals. Have you ever tried to read and interpret what's written in any religious text like the Gita? AMEN BROTHER Yes, complete agreement.  I call this anti-theism, not atheism. Religion is a tool people use to deal with living it isn’t just about death. Unfortunately we’re not pure logical being. A lot of people with emotions will turn to higher powers in any form. Sadly this message will never reach to the people who need to see this. Among them most will simply reject it. ""Religion is the husk of faith"" -Tao Te Ching Lets all realize that the universe doesn't care because it cannot.  Take action based on our species and this shared planet to protect ourselves by cherishing all life around us.  Resist the animal nature or mammalian ways.  Do not overpopulate the planet assuming only humans are important.  Do not pollute and exploit based solely on your very short life span but instead think of long term life.  We are evolution and each choice brings about rewards or failures for our species.  Lets choose to share with all life and allow room because from what we can observe there is no global, universe consciousness that cares. The amount of scientific evidence for religion and flat earth theory is exactly the same. As a society, we just accept the former because it's been around for so long and is ""tradition"". You forgot 30000-15000 years ago we became best freinds with wolves and they have had our backs since . They have shed more blood for us than you could imagine. Fighting off animals to protect our children and crops and domestic animals. I hate how people thank god when it was dog by our side fighting and dying with us. Damn, you went rough. Before religion there were tribes and races. People always loved to form groups for recognition and unity.Thats just the nature of us humans, removing religion will not stop violence although admitting it is very easy weapon, something else will take its place. What needs to be removed is hate and instate understanding our differences and accepting each other. Religion is to humans is what Modi is to India! I agree lol Too bad Modi doesnt feel the same way. Tbh religion fills in the gaps that makes other feel unimportant as they do not matter to the universe. You can follow a religion and my opinion of you wouldn't go any lower and rather than having emotions that make you feel unimportant it can be good at times. tl;dr

Religion is outdated. But. It fills an important role.

Why are we here? What's next? Why did this bad thing happen to me? Look at all these people, they compete for my education, my job, my housing, my future wife... they are my enemies! Why should I not harm others?

There are a bunch of questions that are very hard to answer without some fundamental truth - or lacking that, something that you accept as fundamentally true. kendrick lamar once said: ""fuck your ethnicity""

thanks

also today is ash wednesday They like to say that religion brought people together. No. It united certain groups of people to become stronger than other groups of people so that they might kill and decimate them. Fuck all Religion. Yes - otherwise religion will fuck us all! Can I have an Amen...!!! Someone get this guy some Jesus in his life ASAP! Well that’s certainly one opinion Look into the church of the flying spaghetti monster.  This is the only understandable religion imo. It ain’t that bad.

I guess it’s because religion has never been a negative thing in my life, and I’ve been lucky to be born into a country that allows me to practice what I want, in a community that is forgiving, and for a family that doesn’t judge.

I literally do not care what my neighbors believe or don’t believe. I agree Thank you, you are better than every god bothering nobody I am glad they burnt petrol pump, at least someone is unhappy because of hiked fuel prices :D Please talk about economy at this stage man please, people were saying the growth rate has been negative but since the 2020 has started I have heard or read no news on how the economy is going. I 100% agree, well said Religion is Politics. Something you use to keep society under control. But I wouldn't use the f word here. Some people are good enough to do things on their own but plenty others need guidance.
And once again a rookie mistake of connecting Deity with Religion. 
The one who follows religion is the one who follows the rules of society. But the one who seeks God is the one who renounces all possesion and abandons the social life. I like this one It is superstition, like ghosts or bigfoot I really really wish Ravi Zacharias could respond to some these comments. It would be hilarious and sad at the same time... I didn't know I had a twin in India. Wishing you a great life friend. Too Right 👏 I completely agree, especially with all the shit going on in Delhi rn Yup, finally someone said it. 👍🏻 Finally someone who gets it and is talkong sense. Religions are one of the biggest cancers of the world right now. And if you really believe the bullshit they tell, i dont know what to tell you... Life isnt a fairytale Now this is a good post! Religion is like spoiled milk. Hey fuck you buddy 👉🏻

MODI GANGGG 🇮🇳 Hoes mad Time to sort by controversial Life was a party till religion came along..

Humans still understood right from wrong because they have emotions... understanding right from wrong is all that matters... If only people have the will and the mind to believe what they actually believed all these years is utter bullshit. I can only imagine a better world without religion. More morale, more discipline, and a whole lot of love. Thank you OP, you are correct. Very well written and I wish you the best.

There are some wonderful Bollywood anti-religious movies available. These three movies are quite funny and a few of my favorites. 

[Dharam Sankat Mein ('Religion in Trouble')](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4354740/?) - *At the age of 55, a Hindu man discovers that he was born Muslim and adopted by a Hindu family.*  It has a score of 6.3 on IMDB; 

[PK](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2338151/?) - *An alien lands on earth and acts so crazy they ask if he's 'PK' which means 'tipsy' or 'drunk.'* It has a score of 8.1 on IMDB; and 

[OMG: Oh My God](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2283748/?) - *An atheist files at lawsuit against God.*. It  has a score of 8.2 on IMDB.

[Here's a list of 7 movies that reflect the dark side of religion.](https://in.bookmyshow.com/entertainment/movies/hindi/bollywood-movies-on-religion/) Those three are on that list, as well as several that look serious.  I just posted asking why religion is a sensitive topic and everyone downvoted and this has 2.9k likes xD Yo what pissed you off to this extent man? If it brings people happiness.and peace of mind.  It’s wonderful.  And it’s fun to think about what came first the chicken or the egg. Who is reading this in 2020? You're a good person for this, OP. I respect your opinion I see that title, I upvote. Isn't it ironic that almost all atheist have a God complex ? Finnaly something I can read...lmao Here from /r/all and I just wanted to say, **hell yes India!**  Your country seems amazing in many ways, but also so damn backwards... TIL that ""atheist"" or ""none"" is not even an option for official religions/beliefs in your country.  When you look at the trends for how humanity is progressing, almost every advance is met by a decline in religion.  
Get that shit outta there!  
And this, from a 'spiritual' person, Buddhist/Atheist, functionally agnostic, and Canadian, for context if it matters.  
May you all be well and happy, may you all be at peace. Congratulations, you've just explained the core of Buddhism!  I'm only partly joking. Buddhism's main tenents are non-theistic and are about abandoning attachment in order to live fully in the moment and see the world clearly.  But I get your point. Man I wish more people could read this. The whole country needs to read this! a wise man once said Religion is the opium of the masses.. any guess who? but in india that ideology is also made a villain by constant propaganda. if anyone can kick sanghi asses its them. The early people realizes the best. What makes me angry the most is that it is killing the scientific temper in our ppl! Preach. Heh.

  


Seriously though. Yes. Fuck'em all. Take it back, Flying Spaghetti Monster is REAL Of course everyone is confused. The universe is infinitely complicated. We shouldn't look down on them for their ignorance. I don't think all religions are bad but I don't think any of them are 100% correct. I do believe there is something after we die. You can't create or destroy anything in this reality. It only changes form. This. Fuck yeah, man. You nailed it; fuck religion! anti-religion and reddit, name a more classic duo They only way to overcome what is happening is Education Education and more Education which is seriously lacking in this nation. Yeah man. All the most horrible stupid people I know are religious. I think it's a direct correlation to not thinking critically and being a blind sheep follower. That's why USA is so fucked up right now. All these idiots believe everything they are told on facebook and white supremacist propaganda sites. Fuck Religion. Finally I don’t know what’s going on in India right now but come on man calm down. A belief is merely an opinion one refuses to reconsider. That, and pride in beliefs is the ultimate in egotism. Let it all go, and people can be free and better. one hundred percent agreed The first part is pretty much what i think about religion as well, it's a very well organized scam to convert people to believe in some bullshit as well as syphon as much money as they can from the individual. Since when a sub about Inda got so smart, you're right tbh Did not expect this post in r/india, kinda refreshing to see this mindset. I am not too keen on religion myself. r/atheism Yeah science is cool! Marx once said, ""Religion is the opium of masses"". I Don't follow his ideology but he straight up was throwing truth bombs in 1800s. Still relevant to this day! As someone who’s never been involved in any religion, I just can’t seem to understand how people can use a collection of stories from 2000 years ago to justify acts of murder and conflict. All religions are just hate groups, but they’re “justified” because they have religious intent. “We hate the gays, but our 2000 year old book says it’s okay, so we are the ones in the right”. Nice post OP, it’s good to know that there is some resistance to the brainwashing that is religion How about fuck the people who cant respect other people's beliefs without murdering them and destroying their places of worship I disagree with the part where you know what happens after death. No one knows it and no one will ever know. Just impossible. It could be a big simulation for example. Fuck all your beliefs as well. Coronavirus knows no religion and likely coming soon. The great equalizer. https://suchanek.name/texts/atheism/index.html Came out the gate swinging There is a Facebook group for atheist parents if people are interested. It’s called Godless Parents. I don’t use Facebook much but wanted to throw out that option. The group is for getting support and ideas on raising children outside of any faith and how to deal with family/friends/schools who sneak it in. Religion shouldn't exist in the 21st century.
It exemplifies human weakness to keep depending on a false sense of hope that doesn't exist.
I hate it to the core, probably this is the one thing I hate the most in the world. All things that further separate us from one another (such as religion) are things we ought to step away from as soon as possible. Finally a person who speaks the truth Ok but who the fuck started imagining blue monkeys and elephants as gods, fucking polytheists Whilst I do agree with everything you said, confirmation bias will insure that your words fall on deaf ears when they are most needed.  Humanity can be both awesome and terrible.  I would like to think the awesome will win out, but I fear it will not.  Best of luck.  Maybe you will get some people to hear your message. Look up a guy named Mark passio on YouTube bro. You won't feel so isolated in your thoughts. Sort by controversial. Don't forget to get your popcorn Here here dear friend!! Ok, but how does that have anything to do with India... I used to feel that religion was the bane of mankind, but I’ve evolved into the idea that it’s irrationality that’s the issue, not really religion. I know many religious people that don’t reflect the worst of their cohort, and it’s trivial to demonstrate that non-religious societies often replicate the worst aspects of religious behavior. What passes for “religion” in most places is really just a combination of bigotry and self-interested politics. Background: I run a humanist, atheist organization, and I don’t like religion. Love of God/ Fear of Wrath of God ..... whichever way you look at it , whats has been significant?:

the pain and misery has been caused becuase of it 
or
the amount of pain it has prevented/ aleviated.

Each will have a different opinion on this.

Maybe we can look at it a different way:

Everything starts out with a good purpose and intentions .... but along the way certain individuals find a way to contort/skew/misinterpret/misrepresent relegion to their advantage and greed.

Faulting religion for the misdeeds of individuals of use it for their greed and gluttony is like blaming the easy target.

The emotional reponse of Love and Hate are equally strong and powerfull.
These miscreants know that faith is so emotionally engrained/entwined in us that we would repond to it strongly.

Triggering an emotional response in us based on hate  is easy for these people.
thats what they are gud at.

Hate these individuals.
Dont hate the faith.

If it was easy to be nice and kind then there wouldnt be any pain and sadness in the world.

it's in times like these that ones needs to find compassion and kindness in their heart for one and all. Based on the current events I am feeling proud for leaving religion. Still my family is extremely relegious but both me and my sibling has permanently left relegion. You too have your religion m8, so shut up! I don't give a fuck what anyone else believes as long as they make the world a better place. Fuck yeah! When it comes to bullshit, big-time, major league bullshit, you have to stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims, religion. No contest. No contest. Religion. Religion easily has **the greatest bullshit story ever told**. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there’s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever ’til the end of time!

But He loves you.  - George Carlin Amen Oof India is absolutely driven by religion. Remember friends, sort by controversial ;) Thank you! This guy gets it. I agree I like how this was put under the flair politics, because ultimately that is what all of religion is, powerplay politics Yawn. Fuck off. 
Believing in something does not make you any less valid. 
Believers can be just as kind and good for the world as anyone else.
Keep on with your anger and hate, I live each day to the fullest and only think about my religion based on how grateful I am each day. 
You are not special for not believing in anything. 

Organized religion is damaging but the instant you go after people's personal beliefs you become an asshole. I'm a kind person but fuck off. Start with eating beef Edgy Damn, knowing the people on Reddit I fully expected this post to be downvoted to hell. I guess you were lucky Today my exam didn't go well exactly and my grandma blamed it all on my black shirt. They say its not the black colour god day. Honestly am i to laugh or use this fact as an advantage . Perfectly summed up, really well said. Having a religion is like totally not believing in yourself Damn.. Never thought I'd see this in an Indian subredit. Our country is pretty religious.  I've never really met another atheist and we can't be vocal here.  

I must agree that religion is a major source of unrest in India. It's getting scary. I love this country but I can't say I'm proud of it. 

It seems that for every step forward, we take two steps back.  I'm hoping that change will happen and I do plan on doing my part in it. This is lame  Exhaust people loose morals without religion. People say “tHaTs NoT tRuE” but have no evidence for that besides atheist are nice sometimes. You don’t have to believe and people shouldn’t force you to believe but don’t talk bad about it. You just sound like an asshole, like saying “FUCK FAMILIES because theirs a big universe and spending time with them is a waste of to me.” Some people value families like religion so don’t be such a fucking dick about it. I agree that religion has caused nothing but trouble on a large scale. I'm strongly against organized religion because it tries to make claims about the unknowable and dictate how other people should live based on these beliefs. Which is also what this post, and athiests in general, also do yet never seem to realize it. Self aware wolves, the lot of you.

No one knows if there is a God or not. No one knows if there is heaven or hell. No one knows that upon death it's simply black and nothing. No one knows the truth to any of this with any certainty at all. In this regard, atheists are just as infuriating as theists. Both sides make claims about he unknowable and try to dictate how others should live and believe based on their own personal beliefs. What makes them comfortable. 

It takes a tremendous leap of faith to believe in god and a tremendous leap of faith to disbelieve. Neither side is right just because they shout it at you.

Believe whatever you want. Let others believe whatever they want. Recognize you have no way to know who is right or wrong about the unknowable, and leave each other alone when it comes to their beliefs.

The general messages about good character from religion are great. Some people need that from a book, others don't. All religions share the general message of ""don't suck"" and ""be good to others"". Just do that and you're probably winning this game.

Personally, I believe in god completely. I believe in an afterlife. But I completely reject all organized religion because of the reality that no one knows the truth on any of this, along with most major religions having thousands of years of murder, rape, and pedophilia under their belts. I don't need someone else to tell me what to believe or think about the unknowable, especially not someone or some organization with that track record and lack of humanity in direct contradiction to their messages.

Basically, if anyone tries to tell me what to think about the unknowable, theist or atheist, they can piss off. You don't know anything. No one does. Sit down, shut up, and let people believe whatever they want about such things. I wonder what happened to this guy... lmao. TLDR;
I guess the post heading sums it up. I’m with you bro. Fuck all religion except mine./s I fully believe religion is main hindrance to the progress of the human race and people just go around wanting to ‘respect’ others and their ‘religions’. It’s all bullshit. Modi Failed India big time. He failed economy and now Delhi is burning. He needs to act fast and step down before whole india get burned. Anger comes from things you don’t understand.  

One day you will.

Till then stay angry my friend. John Lennon was ahead of his time. I wish I had coins to award this post (unfortunately I don't have any till now lol). One of the best posts I have seen here. Truth!! 💯 You go India man or woman or not determined yet! Religion is a mental illness. Simple. I'm not a big fan of religion either, but I'm also not going to shut someone down if they're using it as a coping mechanism. As long as they aren't a dick about it and are actually a good person, they can use whatever they want to cope. There's worse things than religion. So what if they're afraid of death? I'm happy you're taking that reality so well but some people struggle to the point where their life is seriously impacted, and a small glimmer of hope that is an after life can improve their quality of life. Amen to that you know... some of what youre saying isnt too far off, but on the other hand some of it is fairly ignorant   

  

for example, you state that death means you cease to exist as if it's a matter of fact.  you're certainly confused and I will attempt to lead you toward objective fact as opposed to your opinion.  

  

first thing to recognize is, youre having an identity issue.  you seem to think that you are your body. (you've identified with it)  and when the body dies, it must mean you die too. that's not quite accurate.  you are not your body.  if you lose  an arm for instance, you've lost a part of your body, but you havnt lost yourself.  you still exist.  that's because what you are is something more, beyond name and physical form. so what are you?  well the truth of the matter is, you are life. you are the life allows your physical body to function. and when you, the life, departs from that body it will be dead.  but you can not 'lose your life' when you ARE life.  you just move on to a new form.  

  

no i know this may seem like it took a religious turn as im essentially talking about what is generally known as 'reincarnation', but the simple fact is there's a fuckton of evidence for it.  sure the ancient religions have known for a while, but similar to you, im over religion, i dont find it very useful.  I with off the top of my head I could remember a lot of good sources that show the reincarnation must be an actual thing, as I have seen many, but just to get you started, there is a documentary called 'the boy who live before' I believe.  I could describe it but its better to just judge for yourself.  Basically a child is able to remember his past life, and they track down his old town, old house, family etc.. and its a great mystery how he knew all the details of that old life...  

  

in any case, you right in that you dont need religion.  in fact the just conflate and confuse things, but dont stop looking for answers!  you dont have it all figured out Dont hate the game,  hate the player. Best reddit post ever! Yeah. Fuck it all. Damn look at the amount of foreigners here I don't think it's the religious experience of individuals that is so destructive but institutionalised religion alias the church that blinds people and detaches individuals from what religion really is. I mean, we're making examples of all the war and futile deaths that came as a cause of religion but come to think about it, how many of the people who committed those acts were truly religious. Almost none of the christian community live by the example of Jesus and the bible, they follow it because it's what the mass does and the more you just follow the mass, the less individual you become. 

So let's not say fuck religion.

Fuck the Church. Fuck Creed. Fuck the institution. Word. I'm gonna print this and hang it in my room. Sad but true religion is bad. If Trump can  cheat on 3 wives and still be considered Christian and appointed by god by the evangelical community then somethings something wrong with it. Yeah, yeah, we get it. Anyone with an ounce of ability to think critically can tell that organized religion is magical nonsense. This isn't something that's susceptible to rational argument, however. Your arguments aren't going to change the minds of the devout, and you aren't telling us anything new. Most of the violence in human history has been over material resources or ideology. Got it.

Instead of simply shitting on everyone who feels differently than you do, why not take a more scientific approach? *Why* do most people on earth subscribe to one religion? Why do humans believe in god(s)? Instead of just telling people that they're wrong (with numbers, charts, and diagrams to illustrate the depth of their wrongness,) isn't it time to address the more fundamental, underlying issues at work? Religion isn't something that's *being done* to people, it is ubiquitous, and it appears in isolated populations. As far as I know, there isn't a human culture, now or in historical record, that was without religion.

I suspect that your frustrations are caused by two things: religious or magical thinking, and a willingness to exploit people who rely on magical thinking. The first I find to be strange, and quite interesting, while the second is common and reprehensible. Don't confuse ""the church"" (or any other religious authority) with religious thought.

I'm an atheist, and I've never been part of any religion. I accept most of your position, but if you're willing to ask people to shed their beliefs and adopt yours, why don't you try a little experiment? For one month, learn all you can about one, particular religion. Learn about its history, art, culture, tenets, writings, and if possible spend time with adherents. Go to a house of worship, shrine, temple, or whatever. Set your reservations completely aside for one months, and immerse yourself. Deeply, honestly pursue an understanding. Leave your preconceptions behind (they'll be there at the end of the month when you need them,) and try it. If you pick Islam, pray five times a day. Whatever you pick, stick with it, and keep your critical mind on a shelf, for the moment.

Isn't telling people that a mode of thought is worthless, harmful, and destructive a little bit... wel... uninformed, if you aren't willing to attempt to see the world from their perspective first? What you've said takes guts to say in front of public. Imagine saying something like this in public. Probably the person would get lynched. I too believe religion instead of being a solution has been root of many problems more than often. At least the younger generation in metropolitan cities can accept the concept of atheist and that's some kind of progress, but definitely people need to be more accepting and hopefully that will change in future. Excellent post. Consider the vastness of the universe, with 99.9999% being unobservable to us, and consider the unsuitability of almost all of the observable universe towards life.


Then consider that we exist here now, on a rock floating around in nothingness around a burning hot mass of gasses, hurtling away from all such pairs at celestial speeds spreading out further into oblivion.


Consider the astronomical odds for every event that played out exactly as it did to lead up to us existing here now, and then multiply them with each other to get the infinitismally insignificant chances of us existing, and yet here we are.


Untill we are able to explain how or why, religion will continue to exist. Fun fact: Because of religion killing and hunting all nonbelievers and scientists in the medieval ages and earlier, humanity devolved a thousand years. Think bout that. Shit dog, don't hold back next time. See that guy over there, eating dinner with his family just like us? He's a different religion and deserves to die.

That's how stupid our fucking world is. I think the problem is extremists. I believe everyone should be able to believe whatever they want as long as it doesn't affect everyone else. Why can't people just leave each other alone. The world would be a better place if people just respected each other's beliefs and not shove them down each other's throats. People should be able to treat each other like the human beings that we are no matter what religion or beliefs we have. If your religion condemns something someone else is doing, then leave them alone to be condemned. It doesn't affect anyone else's life but theirs. I'm not religious but I respect what people believe in even if I dont believe in those beliefs because it doesn't affect me in the least. I'm ok with anything as long as it doesn't violate anyone's basic human rights. Extremism is the real enemy. Saw this on popular. C’mon man I’m an atheist but if you want religious people to take you seriously you can’t be aggressive about it The problem is not religion it's religious extremists. Religion can be used for good and bad there is more than one side to it. This guy gets it I wouldnt say “Fuck” all religions, but I would say before you can be anything, you must first be a good human being with a clean heart. OP a lil much, you can be a good person and demonstrate great values all while being religious, some people just are not. I love how the subject is religion, yet these autistic ducks of reddit are talking about America  imperialism in the comments, this has to be the most ADHD social media platform on the planet. I thought I was in r/UnpopularOpinion How did I end up here I support you Bae, fuck all religions Sanket? what a fucking reddit moment Religion is messed up I agree. I do believe in a God as the chances of everything aligning so perfectly for life to be formed is minuscule. You may disagree with me but I'll believe what I want to believe. I dont force it on others and I respect their opinion as long as their opinion isnt like OP's, calling people out and saying they are stupid and dumb. There isn't proof of god but there isnt proof against it either. Lack of proof is NOT proof. Well, damn. Congratulations. Cringiest thing I've read all day I wish we could blame it on religion, but I think humanity would still find a reason to destroy itself. Our nature is conflict, religion is just an excuse. Totally agree.. We humans are the worst creature so brave So glad to see this on front page with 12k upvotes.

How the fuck is centuries old religion still mainsteain in 2020, after we've explored space to such an extent and made such scientific advancements, I will never know.

&#x200B;

Remember the Sun was a deity? Oh, that's a ""false"" religion, got it guys. But that noahs ark shit, pretty hardcore. Oh, you don't believe THAT part? Go fuck yourselves. [deleted] Hail Satan. Thank you for saying this. This was beautiful, thank you. wow very brave! I am not religious but I have to disagree with you. There are a lot of people who need a religion to function. They just go with the rules because they are afraid of their gods but not of other people. They would turn into criminals if they accept that religion is completely made up. Other people need it so they don't feel lonely in this world. Religion can be a beautiful thing but sadly it's used mostly for bad things. Please let other be believers and mind your own business. I don't believe in anything but don't mind other people having a made up God in their life as long they're being respectful to others. If they are not it's because they are raised badly or have other issues, but not because of religion itself. It was made so people behave, to avoid chaos. And back then they didn't had the answer to certain scientific questions and used ""God"" as a simple answer to everything. Some people don't wanna hear the complicated answers and want to live a simple life. Let them be. >Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 

Man, they could start a religion about this! Also fuck Modi You forget religion is the only reason humans coordinated on large scale in the first place, without it we would still be barbarians. Not that I believe in god or anything to that effect, humanity would have been doomed without it, but now that we have scientific basis for our actions we are just now approaching a point in time where we *shouldent* need it, so please don’t bash religion too hard, it has its place in our world even to this day. Once someone told me as a kid all the the Greek gods were fairy tales I stopped believing, why is theirs fake but ours real? Religion is complex, I don't know much, but I know religious people who are exceptional people and I know that most have some good philosophys in them. They're probably not suited to our modern age, but their part of our history and culture, so there isn't a need to push it away; maybe to just see it as it is, a belief, nothing more. I have a genuine question, how many people think the world's wars would just stop if there wasn't religion? Do you think the corruption just ends because the veil it's hidden behind is gone, or do you think it would still go on because in reality it's all about greed and power and control?

   My belief is religion is just a tool used to further the end result, and if it wasn't/isn't religion, it's color, or it's geographical location, or it's wealth, or it's because they're shorter, or speak a different language, etc etc there's always going to be some bias that divides people, and there will always be a mask to hide behind to do it. 

  I'm someone who finds comfort in having faith in something because there's a lot left we really don't know, whatever my idea is, but I don't ignore scie xe, and I don't go out of my way to harm people who don't believe, or believe in something I don't. I do agree that the power structure of it should be taken down, and it's disgusting what it causes, but it's the people that hide behind it that are the problem. I tried athiesm but, realized it was also a belief - George carlin Man the edge on this Fuck yeah!! Buddhism actually isn’t a religion that has the “answers” it’s actually about to let go of all the worries in the world like (where u go after u die) and simply quiet the mind  and humble yourself because we simply don’t know!! Insult people in an effort to convince them they're wrong? Solid strategy. Spot on brother man. My “religion” is just treating people like I want to be treated. I know crazy right? Agree on every single points made. Hope more people actually get the message. These man made fairy tales are distracting the masses from progressing together. And instead introducing hatred and twisted views on our own species. Religion has seriously fucked up mankind and its realistic views on the world and created nothing but death and suffering on many levels. And your donation money definitely isn't going to that charity, it's going in father Matthews pocket. As OP said, everyone please wake up. >You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe.

if thats true then just let people believe what they want to believe REDDIT MOMENT im satanist Amen brother! Are indians just now realizing this? Religion is the opiate for the masses Religion is an MLM/Pyramid scheme.  Always has been, and always will be.

Start taxing religious organizations and things will change instantly. Fuck religion. Amen religion isn't really about religion. it's more like political strategy. unfortunately, it works on most people. 67% upvoted , everyone has entitled to their beliefs and that should be. I read an interesting article which basically explained why science can't make countries adopt secularism. Anyway I'll leave a copypasta here:

Religion is like a penis. It's fine to have one, ok to be proud of it, it's even ok to share it with someone if they ask. But it's not ok to shove it down someone's throat against their will!

...and keep it away from children! I mean I don’t believe in any religion but these kind of posts just make me uncomfortable, I think the less you worry about other people’s personal lives the better. Idk why this is r/India but I’m here for the drama! As much as I agree with you, how can you say that our legacy should be to better mankind, when in the end no matter how good mankind is everything ends the same? No one will be remembered for long, no one will will remember if you were a good person or not, so all wrong doing is pretty much as justified as doing the “right thing”. And like you said, spec of dust flying through space, a soon to be (in the cosmic scale) desolate spec of dust just like everything else. So in reality there is no “immortality” for us as you say. Wow... I'm speechless... Sometimes I wonder if trophies like NFL rings, Oscars, nominations, NBA trophies, etc. are just another object people idolize like how people worshipped cows. Kind of sad seeing it happen right in front of our eyes. 'Fuck' religion that **tells people to go hurt/kill other people.** And 'fuck' **dogmatism.**

But on the other hand, your idea that religion is there simply to provide people comfort against ""death"" is not something I necessarily think is proper. For me, some religious afterlives are worse than just having nothing at all - e.g. Buddhist Hells.

>What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe.

From a really cold empirical science perspective, you can say, it almost surely won't. And if you're going to adopt that stance, you should be honest about that. Everything gets reduced to entropy in the end, photonic gas, and 99.9999% of us will be forgotten in no more than a few generations at the very best, and the few that aren't had a lot of probability work in their favor to get them there.

If you want to argue for a worldview rooted solely and purely in cold, hard empirical science, then you have to go **fully** honest about it and the things that *really* make me pop my head are not so much things filled up wholly with lies but which have a large quantity of truths and then *one little snag*.

And I'm not saying that somehow ""proves"" religion right. I'm saying that if you are going to argue it this way, you *should be* honest about it.

**Any** kind of *dogmatic ideology*, I find, is poison. It doesn't matter if it's religious or not. What matters is that it does not tolerate dissent. What matters is if you have decided those who refuse it are evil. All political ideologies go the same way, and the toxic effect of treating them dogmatically and intolerantly is every bit as plain as for religion. Interestingly, you have done just that, and said everyone who believes in religion is ""😈evil😈"". Good, I'll keep being 😈evil😈 then. Proud 😈Devil😈 here. Just as I'll keep being ""😈evil😈"" in the view of any other dogmatist who tells people to just suck up their dogma and don't critically evaluate each bit of it with a fine grained comb and I'll almost always find something to disagree with. Including ""religious"" dogmatists, too, of any stripe. Dogma systems are straitjackets for the mind. Any system that one cannot be flexible with or reserve adherence to all its tenets, inflexibly, rigidly, under threat of personal invalidation, is a mental straitjacket and exactly the kind of poison your *legitimate* points rightfully indict.

And believe it or not, saying ""I *believe"" or* ""I *don't believe*"" in ""God"", are *both* actually equally and more honest than saying ""I *know*"" the answer to this, or asserting it as an absolute fact. There is a hubris in both believing that we can *know* beyond the limits of our sense and empirical experience, as much as there is in believing that actual reality must be coterminous therewith. Neither such statement or confidence can be justified based on reason. We can only justify what we *have* verified empirically, and anything past that is where we must cease to condemn and chastize disagreement. In full honesty, we cannot even *know* the ""laws of physics"" continue forever. Our empirical evidence, our *experience*, gives us no reason to *suspect* they will break, and can give us *confidence* in them, but they just *might*, and maybe there are places they don't apply that we haven't found yet. One can, of course, pull out the Russell tea pot argument and say it's irrelevant, but my point is not to argue its relevance any more than its correctness, but rather to argue against your moralism of people, which is as reprehensible as that which has flowed from the mouth of any authoritarian religious preacher in any religion.

People should not be considered vile for *whatever* they believe in this matter. I have no problem with you going for atheism, I have a **big** problem with you calling people evil, simply on dint of a *belief*. **That** is what leads to all the horrible things you rightfully indict.  You or someone like you may become the next persecutor. The only way to stop persecution is for everyone to respect disagreement.

And no, I'm not then saying ""persecute the persecutor"" or ""persecute the ones who say people are evil"". I am voicing both my own disagreement and my intent to not be daunted by your taunts. Some thousand years ago, the purpose of religion was not to create chaos as it is today, rather to create a civilisation and induce fear of God so that man may not commit wrong deeds.

Today, we have nations and better human development systems like schools and universities and hence we don't need religion.

I always say, religion is a tax which we are paying.

Now, not having a religion does not mean god does not exist, and if atheism is based on the belief that God does not exist, also give rise to a religion where people believe unequivocally on the non-existence of a non-existent.

So, it is better to have God but no religion. I used to think this was true. But recently I've realised that religion is just a stick for people to hang their tribalism and prejudice on. 

You could remove all religion tomorrow and we'd find something else to fight over. In fact you can already see it in politics and things like Brexit. 

The troubles in Northern Island were labelled as religious but really they were territorial and tribal. I'm pretty sure it's the same in the middle east. 

Religion just gives you a rule book or some easy way to pit yourself against someone else. Fuck religion I agree with everything this enlightened gentleman said. People need comfort, religion gives them comfort.

People need to feel good about themselves, and religion makes people feel good about themselves (at the expense of others) Yes. This. Religion is a distraction from any complexity. People hate people because <insert your text here> [religion, caste, race, age, gender, national origin, color, ethnicity, political views... Etc etc] Religion was invented by power hungry elites to control the generally ignorant population. I second this. I'm an ex Muslim Indian. Fuck ALL religions. You know what, amen to this! In bible first murder was also to get recognition from god... But they dont see that.. The thing is if the God didn't meddled with Able and Cane's life for getting sacrifice.. the story would have been different... ya, but as the people join atheism, they will use that to oppress the one with religion. Religion is not the problem, people using it to their advantage and manipulating others is. If you think joining atheism may do some good, wait till some atheist goes and beats up religion following people.

I don't think any religion serves hate, and those who really practice religion are not goons. 

sorry for bad English and typos if any. I am gonna come back to this and gain my sanity when I seem to lose it. Thanks! Care about yourselves and the people around you. We build this world, not God or anything else. We don't know all the answers, but we will find them step by step. I’m not a religious person but is this is such a Reddit tier post. Genghis khan didn’t kill millions of Chinese and Iranians out of Tengrism. Tribalism is inherent to humanity, we will always find a reason to divide and hate Humans observe something.

Humans try to explain that something. 

Humans fail to do so.

Humans create imaginary power to explain thing they failed to explain previously.

BAM religion.

Now, humans do science.

Now, science succeeds in explaining things that were previously unexplainable.

Now, despite having scientific evidence and explanation of stuff, (some) humans still believe in religion instead. 

&#x200B;

Science and religion cannot coexist. 

Religion must be excluded from politics in and shape or form.

Anything that has to do with religion should not be supported financially by the state and therefore by taxes. All financial support for anything religious should be shifted to support causes which are based on science.

&#x200B;

everyone should still be free to believe in whatever he or she wants. No one should get any disadvantages from doing so, but (and that is the important part!): no one should get any benefit from doing so either. And everyone who tries to manipulate anyone else in believing into something that he or she does not yet believe in, should face trial for religious missionary work, which should be illegal to begin with. Being Atheist and being a human is the best thing to be in this world. Amen! EUPHORIC Preach brother! Can't we just use some made up religion for ids like dinkoism or the church of flying spaghetti monster? I applaud you for your courage. Hopefully India breaks free of it's chains and can finally start being a secular nation, or at least, a nation where the separation of Church and State is upheld.

Good luck to you and your country friend. I've been calling myself a Hindu atheist for 3 years now, since the age of 15. I was proud to belong to an ancient culture of tolerance, peace and justice. I was proud of our customs, ways and multiple traditions, hence I called myself a Hindu atheist, even though I rejected all religion and their philosophies including Hinduism. Today, I no longer want to be called a Hindu. I no longer want to associate myself with tribalism. Religion is a threat to life. Religion is organized crime. Religion does not belong in developed societies. Religion is the preamble to barbarism. No religion can take moral high ground. Fuck Religion. I officially denounce hinduism. Those many medals are giving me anxiety . Oh my god .

🤣 Imagine there's no heaven

It's easy if you try

No hell below us

Above us only sky

Imagine all the people living for today


Imagine there's no countries

It isn't hard to do

Nothing to kill or die for

And no religion too

Imagine all the people living life in peace, you


You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one

I hope some day you'll join us

And the world will be as one


Imagine no possessions

I wonder if you can

No need for greed or hunger

A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you


You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one

I hope some day you'll join us

And the world will be as one Nicely written, it will hit the ""Fake religious ego"" named as ""Religious sentiment"" of the religious extremists.

I'm not an atheist but I love when the ego of any religious extremist gets hurt, I just absolutely love watching their so called ""religious sentiment"" getting hurt because all these morons have ever done is distract everyone from the real problems, cause riots, hurt human lives. you just put my thoughts into words.. happened to stumble upon this and thank you. I thank OP for posting this. I feel the exact same way . Glad to see someone vent it out I wish I saw this when I was like 8 I was already a non believer but was to scared to tell anyone Happy that you said it and the kind of response it got. Opium of the masses as Karl Marx said. I agree, from the uk >None of your religions are without blood in your hands. 
Buddhism enters the chat Yes my friend! A thousand times yes! Edgy I kinda respect religion but yeah I feel you Science flies you to the moon, religion flies you into buildings. From the series Mr Robot



Is that what God does?

He helps?

Tell me,

How about the racist,

That's just how he owns you.


Even I'm not crazy enough

to believe that

distortion of reality.


So fuck God.


He's not a good enough

scapegoat for me. Edgy. So edgy. I think we're stuck between a fake left wing that just wants to appease minorities and a rightwing that wants to install a tyranny of the majority. When the constitution clearly wants us to put aside the religious differences and want common good for everyone, I don't think, we, people are not ready yet to think in such higher terms. After all these years since we said our good byes to British, we only inherited the golden divide and rule policy to keep people invested in their religious sentiments and derive political and economic returns from them. I don't see a near future where people can see through shit and have a true democracy. It's sad, but it's also a painful truth. You're a horrible person for telling people what they can and can't believe in. Religion is one of the reasons this world hasn't completely gone to shit. Keep your horrible opinions to yourself, no one cares what you do or dont have to say about others beliefs. [I like to watch this scene from Mr. Robot every once in a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSQHJXtfpE) Bhai everyone here already knows all this. If your intent of writing this post was to make people ""woke"" then you should post this on family WhatsApp groups. If your intent was just to rant, well, then let me tell you that we already understand this perspective. Yes, by all probablility, God does not exist, and even if He does, it is of no consequence since God doesn't interfere in any way we can see. However, I strongly disagree with your notion that religion is the 'root of all evil'. History proves that religuous societies tend to be more successful, likely because people tend to shy away from crime or disobedience if they feel that 'a higher power is watching them.'

More importantly, religion provides us with hope, something to be happy about and look forward to in grim times. What if there were no Christmas or Diwali or Eid? Life would be rather monotonous and dull. The greatest works of art, literature, music, even science were inspired by religion, be it Sufi ghazals, Rennaissance frescos, or Hindu epics. Yes it is true, communal tension and xenophobia is largely a product of religious extremism, but ultimately, religion has done more good than harm.

In the 'grand scheme of things' religion and humanity itself is undoubtably insignificant. However, by pusuing that train of thought any longer than necessary, you end up living a sorry nihilistic life. Instead, it's much more prudent to enjoy the culture and vibrancy associated with each religion, rather than getting swallowed up by fanatacism or depression. 

Religious texts are some of the most enlightening philosophical pieces ever written if you take the time to understand them, and if you've actually read some, you'd realize that it's not the crap about a 'One true God' that is meant to be read, but the centuries of moral and ethical teachings poured into them by countless 'spiritual' leader i.e. basically just modern-day philosophers. Buddhism is actually nice bro. Buuut yeah we get your point. >Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion.  
   
You do realize that everything is made up bullshit. Including ideas like 'equality', 'liberty', 'money'. Things like equality are fantasy born in some human minds. Just like religion. But we embrace it.   
   
The only reality of our species is 'survival'. Thats the only reality. Everything else is fantasy. Equality, religion, discrimination, liberalism, etc. I believe in religion. You can have your own opinion.

If you don't believe it's up to you but claiming that no God exists is more irrational (even mathematically) then saying God does exist.... I understand your sentiments. 

But, tell me, if you're so insignificant, why should anyone listen to you? Why do you feel anger? What special rights do you have? Why not cull humans who don't deliver value to society? Why not go killing each other anyway? It's a one time fun.

Do you realize that the sense of greater good, a belief in rising higher is what sustains us and religion is a byproduct of that?

And you're not able to prove, nobody is, that humans are insignificant. Neither are the religions able to prove that there's a heaven or hell after death.

But the mystics of every religion, who have refined their minds, have philosophies that logically convince us that humans are a superior expression of the force that created the supernovae. OH GOD THIS GUY Okay, I understand where you're coming from. But don't shit on other people's belief, that's pretty rude.

If you wanna shit on anyone/anything shit on the people who differentiate and spread hate based on religion, culture etc etc. Religion helped us, Sapiens, shape our world as it is today. It's a fact that we need common beliefs, be it religion, fiction, science or any other imaginary concept, to work our way up together.

Religion has played its role in bringing us so much further than we expected.

It's sad to see something that was supposed to help us work together, build and design our future has taken a wrong turn into violent extremism and foolishness. Somebody finally fucking understands me. 
I am a 15 year old atheist. I hate that God Who created all the trouble between us. He never existed. So what's the meaning of science if he fucking exists.!?

Fuck you All Religions Well said buddy. This was a good read. Live and let live.. keep thy religion to thy fucking self. Simple fuckin rule. 

They have used this card for far too long to stay in Power.

I do not believe in karma or a higher power, but to be fair I hope who actually caused this! The hate speech deliverers and the people in power who could've stopped this would get the justice they deserve. 

Really shameful to call myself an Indian. religion is the most damaging thing to ever plague humanity. i will never understand why even in 2020 the populace refuse to acknowledge the damage. i want to believe we will someday grow beyond it, but we already should have and the evil might plague us even for another 5000 years. i'm sure there were people who understood this 5000 years ago, and they lost hope for this world same as i do now. If there can be a ""prefer not to say"" for gender, why can't we have a religion that can have the same ideology. Excellent....been waiting for this one. 👏👏 Join r/atheismindia Buddhism is not intended to be a religion my friend, but I agree. Still though, the whole part about being insignificant and matter and the universe and all that, that was very Buddhist lol.

Just to clarify. Buddhism in its core (without all the religious mumbojumbo) is about accepting that everything ends and chilling the fuck out about it so you can be a nice person whos not driven by the constant need reduce your fear of death by indulging in activities that get you nowhere.

But yeah, fuck religions. I am an Atheist and i made my Whole Sikh Family Atheist, let's change them one at a time. My religion is responsible for less death than yours -Andh bhakt I would like to use this to promote r/atheismindia May I propose creating a new sub called /r/indianatheists?

&#x200B;

Edit: Looks like it already exists but is restricted.

In that case, I've created r/atheistsinindia Corona virus in India took 0 life.
Guess how many lives the religion virus took? I didn't know there were so many atheists here, lmao. Happy to know that someone knows the truth. I think this belongs here :

When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month – that’s fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years – that’s a religion, and we are admonished not to call it ‘fake news’ in order not to hurt the feelings of the faithful (or incur their wrath).
          ---Yuval Noah Harari What you are offering is not a solution. But another label that people can put on themselves. And create separate factions with people identifying as this label. Just because you don't pray to a ""made up diety"" does not make it any less religious in a way that truly matters.

Religion is far greater, deeper and broader than you can imagine. Religion stems from a need in humans in general that is fundamental to human nature 

> Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova

I am sure you feel superior somehow. When you curse the religions. Or doubt the sanity of people who follow religion. Or quote random scientific facts as moral arguments. You feel good about it. And you feel that you have found the true path. The path that lesser people don't get, and it is your duty to preach this path to these people.

Sure go ahead. You are free to do so. 

But starting by abusing and disregarding the competition is rarely a recipe for a successful business. Just an analogy. Don't mind me. I am just here to read all the comments............ Trust me the only reason of making religion is to limit the thinking power, iq of a common guy

The same reason is with free internet and free surfing, our perception is made to be controlled by someone else.

AI will take it to another level. Intelligent people are the most difficult people to   govern Wow, very brave post. Let us rise up, gamers, and overthrow the Religion! While I agree with you on religion, I find it really funny when you said. 

>the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.  

The reason I find this funny is because the only way you would actually know this is if you died, experienced it, then returned.  Else, you are just taking it on faith that that is what happens when you die.  

Sure we all know what happens to you body when you die.  But there is literally know way of knowing you stop existing. 

This is why I’m agnostic.  I also don’t believe in organized religion personally.  But I don’t judge people (like you are) for their beliefs, I judge them for who they are. 

This post is no worse than what you are hating. Been trying so hard to tell this to people but damn, I get heat from religious people. They hold no bars either. 

I feel like religious people are what is wrong with this world. If there is a God, well he can go fuck himself. Send me to hell. As a Hindu living outside India... this is really sad to see. The only connection I have to India is the fact that I’m a Hindu. Congratulations on throwing away 3000 years of rich history. Fuck this post sounds exactly like my existential crisis and almost had a panic attack reading it The reason why what you wrote lacks validity is that you talk only in great generalities, and that's where the falsehood lies. What you are referring to as ""religion"" could refer to a very wide and complicated range of human behaviors, cultures, ideas. Your conclusion is really the height of arrogance because you think you're the expert in a bunch of things you clearly know very little about, and in spite of your ignorance you want everyone to follow what *you* decree from your own self as an ideal culture, belief system, behavior, etc. The way you wrote your post, you're acting like you're some freaking prophet come to deliver us the Truth. Sit down, son. Try studying and learning more so you don't sound so ignorant in the future.

By the way, how old are you? 15? You seriously think you're justified in telling all humans on Earth to leave their wisdom and value systems just because you know grade-school level science and history?

>We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.

This is very easy to disprove.

>As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better

Practically speaking, this did not happen. Scientific discoveries in history and advances in technology enabled humans to commit the greatest atrocities ever before witnessed.

>but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed

Baseless assertion, easy to disprove.

You arguments are also hypocritical, because it's just as simple (but equally wrong) to assert that atheism is evil. The greatest instances of mass murder in human history were deliberately carried out by atheists or people following anti-religion ideologies. Fuck religion! RELIGION IS TERRORISM!!!!! This post only shows, how arrogant and actually disgusting atheists can be. i could take my time and dismantle every part of it, but you are definitly a lost cause. >You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe

To main kya job chod dun fir. Important transitions in history are seldom driven  primarily by human wishes. - The Sovereign individual Well, at a certain level, everything is insignificant, which doesn't mean they need to be eradicated. Everybody is entitled to their view, and if that's your view, then so be it. It's an anthropological tendency to form cliques, and humans have evolved this way. It's ""natural"" to not be a pariah. I'd like to go one step above and point out that rather than religion, it's any **-ism** that ends up creating an 'Us vs. Them' at scale and ends up creating the same problems as religion. That's more down to human nature. Religion is something a lot of pacifist humans would like to point as increasing human misery. I'm not saying OP is wrong, he/she is right, to an extent, just that religion is the low hanging fruit in the 21st century. Even **Greed is as bad as Religion** but rarely do humans write gilded posts about **Greed** on this sub (may be there on other subs).

Ironically, most world religions advocated harshly against greed but look where we've all ended up. Is religion the real root of the problem or is it just the **enabler** for flawed humans ?

If it weren't **religion**, it'd simply be some other -**ism** instead: Capitalism or Communism or something else. Humans, in general are not wired for contentment - That is our blessing as well as our curse.

Almost all humans are also wired towards some form of **group-ism**. That's what helped us survive and proliferate as a species (i don't mean individual survival but at group level).

In old days, religions (or more of **shared ideas and traditions** than **polarizing religion** as we call it today) actually helped groups (again, not individuals) to exceed the Dunbar number amongst other scientific advances. While this was perfect for handling large groups where a lot of people don't know each other, not so great for peace when 2 different groups encounter each other with different perspectives of life. That is when religion as we know it today becomes - more of a liability and less of an asset.

So what's the solution ?

**Change human nature to be less power-hungry and greedy and more pacifist across all cultures** \- Easier said than done. That's actually the reason no-one wants to be the first to become pacifist, if your group is relatively peaceful but the other side doesn't care about peace, just greed & resources, well then your group is history. I'm atheist but I think its foolhardy to believe that if we take away religion we'll suddenly be in utopia. It's better to face the fact that life is hard and try to incrementally improve rather than believe there's a magical cure. [removed] Bahut hi badhiya likha gya, badhai ho iske liye.

The problem today isn't religious differences.

Free market capitalism and liberalism promised a bright future, which hasn't really materialised. Since the 2008 crisis, there is widespread discontent globally, which is leading to a rise in extremism.

Yes BJP plays a communal brand of politics and flames the fire whenever it can, but that's not the whole picture here. In our country it is taking shape as a communal issue. Religion is just the top most class in a hierarchy for classification.There will be always something to classify humans,right now it's name is ""religion"". There was a philosopher who argued that mainstream Religion caused less violence, as it brought smaller groups into one large group, rather than smaller groups constantly fighting amongst themselves. Not sure I agree with this, but an interesting viewpoint Dunno have you tried religion without casteism?

Seriously tho, there is a south park episode along these lines. Actually it's a 3 or 4 partner where cartman goes into the future to get an x box. It involves talking otters.  “Certain linguistic anthropologists think that religion is a language virus that re-writes pathways in the brain, dulls critical thinking.”  - Rust Cohle (True Detective). Amem brother. Well, TBH, there is a reason why religion works, but people seemed to have taken it beyond that.

Religion is an extremely effective way to buil faith in oneself and his work. 

Faith and belief are Powerful things. It's like a substitute for people who can't believe in themselves. And they've become so deep in the idea of this God helping us throughout life, that thinking otherwise would be inconceivable. i do not think this has to do with Religion, religion is just a cover for people to form groups. Humans being social animals tend to create groups , we see ants of the same species fighting it out to the death in wars, we see lions killing the young cubs to make the females receptive, and do not even get me started on the closest relatives of ours Chimpanzees, i saw a documentary where they literally beat to death and primate of another troupe just because he entered into their territory and proceeded to canibalize him. 

In absence of religion we would just find something else to group  , be it race or region. Is atheism a religion? Buddhism? Come on man, all you're doing is giving thanks for the teachings I used to think like you sometime back. Then I realised we would find reasons to divide ourself and then fight over it. Even in a world without religion there would be something else to divide us by and fight over. Proud atheist here. Absolutely loved reading this on this sub. Ngl, I was expecting a lot of backlash in the replies, but damn, I'm surprised to say the least. Feels good to see so many fellow Indian atheists.

Thanks for the sub recommendation. :) *nidharma vabha* Mahler tho All I'm saying is a gun can't kill a person and everyone's always said religion is for interpretation I'm personally not religious but to say it's shit is pretty stupid. I think most religious books are pretty well written and give great moral stories Pope's rapes children but that's not the study of Christianity. Well you haven't heard about jedi (the religion)........ Yes its a real recognised religion in new Zealand. Yeah man that is like, your opinion. Cause starting with “fuck you” is a great way to open people’s minds.... What did the Buddhists do? Isn't buddhism about self improvement of ones relationship with self and nature? Honestly, I'm atheist and know little about buddhism aside from a religious studies class I took in college but from what I've seen Buddhists are more about preservation of nature and self which doesn't seem bad (comparatively at least) to me. The sun isn't big enough to supernova though You guys are clueless. Religion automatically declines with increase in wealth, as it has in the West. 

The solution is to focus on improving the economy, which our government is also clueless about I totally get where you are coming from and I agree that most of religion is outdated, but I do not believe that it is pointless. My grandma is 70. She has nothing in life remaining other than religion. She would be sitting at home right now just letting her body go to waste but instead she goes to the temple every single day. It gives her purpose. Does that make her weak or a coward afraid of death? I think not. You might have come to terms with the fact that this life goes nowhere and just comes to an end, but it is not an easy concept to grasp. And it gets more and more horrible of a thought the closer you get to death when your body is in pain and your friends and family are withering away. 

Religion provides two things: community and a moral code. Community in the sense that even if you go somewhere where you are out of place, you will find a small group of like minded individuals through the local church or temple or mosque. It is kind of a support system, an extended family. And most importantly, it provides a moral code. Not everyone is born a genius with a perfectly set line on what is good or bad. It is taught. Which is why you can see certain traits throughout religions communities. 

The problem with religion stems in two things: outdated logic-less rituals and religious supremacy. For the first point, there are outdated rituals like not letting females cook or go to the temple during periods that need to be understood and shut down. In the past, when people did not have an understanding of periods and females speaking up was taboo, this ""rule"" made them exempt from their most important daily duties- cooking and going to the temple. It is of course not relevant anymore because people actually talk about periods and understand them and husbands aren't going to force their wives to cook when they are in pain and just need to rest for a bit. The second, and more harmful problem, is religious supremacy. Christianity and Islam actually believe that they are the highest form of religion and their path is the only true path. This is obviously a toxic mindset which belittles everyone else and also why there are religious missionaries trying to convert people into their religion. Hinduism is actually a very inclusive religion that says that there are many paths in life and you can be a good person no matter what path you choose. Unfortunately, this concept is getting lost on a lot of people and hence why we have seen a rise of hindutva.

All I'm trying to say is that here can be a little more nuance than ""fuck religion"" or ""this religion is the only path to salvation"". Word. I understand how you feel man, but what if, you’re wrong? I’m a Christian, I’ve study the Bible. From my point of view, there’s lessons and a lot, and I mean a lot of symbolism. I believe in science too. But sometimes I think about how did the universe start. That’s something I think people have no idea or have a clue on how to think about. They’re all theory’s. The universe is so vast and to think of it as 3 dimensional is pretty incomprehensible. But with my understanding of the Bible, it’s humanity that greatly distorts the underlying message of it.

But if everything is blank after death, I’m fine with that too because there’s versus in the Bible taking about getting some rest and I’m fine with that too lol Friendly reminder- there is still a large number of jews living in Germany today, but it was Hitler who shot himself to death I'm agnostic, but saying that if there was no religion, everyone would be happy and peaceful is plain wrong. Unfortunately we are social beings and so we tend to form groups, be it religion, colour, language, class, culture etc. And sooner or later groups will start fighting with each other. It just so happened that religion became a major cause of conflict You need to take some psychedelics and afterwards you’ll sound silly to yourself saying there is no afterlife/soul. I’m not saying it exists, I’m saying that we as ‘smart’ primates are too stupid to know and as you said we are so insignificant that how can we as a disease to our planet know what happens after death. We cannot and will never know. Just a thought :) > We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.

This is not really true. Ethnic and class identities also divide us. They are probably far more serious than religious differences. How is this post not about a ""religion"" you guys calls ""atheism""?
You are calling all the religions stupid and people believing in it are childish. But on the other hand you are so intolerant to all religions and wants everyone to believe in your beliefs that you were an early man then learned basic skills and tools.
Why you want every religious person to believe in this and not in their scriptures?
Atheism is the most intolerant belief.
Humanity is not about stopping everyone to believe in their beliefs it's about coexisting with tolerance, caring, and respecting each other's opinions, beliefs, actions as far as they are not harming the others. Lots of things divide us that aren't religion. Intelect, socioeconomic status, working class and white collar, sex, politics. Religion is definitely not the only thing. The problem comes with religious institutions being too big and having too much influence over people, not the specific religion in and of itself. I can see though why people wouldn't want it and how there are definitely some religious people that need to wake up to sone sense of reality. Just want to point out that Buddhism wasn't supposed to be a religion, but more a way of life (or a way to get through the suffering that is life)

Admittedly that isn't always the case now, but please don't go hating on all Buddhists.

Also, Buddhism is frequently mixed up with Taoism, which most definitely is a religion. No thx We aren't sure yet whether early religion lead to urbanization (towns and cities), or if those communities lead to religion. It appears that religion came first and actually helped bring us together. 

I get your anger at religion. Except religion is just a tool. Would you blame the knife or the one that wields it. 

Obviously that's an oversimplification of a more complicated issue. 

Attacking people angrily whether verbally or physically isn't go to make them change their beliefs. They're going to dig in and fight back. 

If you really want things to change do it peacefully. I seem to remember a man from India doing just that, and he happened to be religious. What happened that got OP mad? But you know, this is just ur opinion man ok Don’t tell me what to do Well bro, you might want to read Sapiens by Noah Hararj.. explains exactly the need for religion. How it is has been important throughout human history as a way to band people together behind a myth. I myself honestly don't need a religion to respect another human and work with him/her. For me, I sometimes feel that the need for religion has run out its time. But reality is often different and you need to respect every religion and the people who get behind it. Why is it that when a black person gets offended, they try to involve more of their black friends to help gang up on you and leave you no room to talk by being loud and obnoxious? Can they not fight their own battles? Religion can be considered uncessecary, but I feel it's a decent way to teach basic morals that sometimes parents fail to do. Growing up around in a city full of mormons, that's probably the one thing I appreciate from their cult. Not to mention religion is a good outlet to experience and understand a lot of cultures. But yeah the beliefs are fucked Amen!!  Preach brother!! I loled hard when I saw the link to the atheism subreddit in the end. Kinda out of place I felt. I know you're angry because of whats going on but this an emotional argument against religion, not an objective one. You've claimed many things, and several are without proof. You've claimed other things, some with truth. You are entitled to your opinion to hate religion but the reality is we are an insignificant spec in the universe and you don't have all the answers to many of the points you have said so you say ""fuck all"" to it. That isn't a logical solution.

What is logical is to understand why they hate and to fix that. You say religion is whats wrong with the world but you also fail to mention at lack of religion. Look at athiest China and Soviet era and see what they've done. And no this isn't an argument against athiesm, but it is the same point people make when they say thiests kill people over thiests. Besides that, lets be honest, I doubt that the hindu or Islamic scriptures incite people to actively go fight and kill people unjustly and I sincerely believe you don't believe it does either. Many of these hardliner terrorists are uneducated in their own religions and common education, selfish, and just plain pieces of shits that need to die. u/motapi Buddhism isn’t a religion, it’s a path and doesn’t believe in any god. Buddhist can believe what they want but at the core the only thing that makes someone a Buddhist is if they follow the 8 fold path and strive to attain enlightenment Nothing like telling us to open our minds by telling us how to think.

>Religion is evil and makes all its followers evil by extension. 

Objectively evil? I think you get a good idea about religion and beliefs when you watch the ending of Bhool Bhulaiya. Pretty good watch. Will recommend >""be loyal to your species"" . What about other animals & beings dwelling this planet? Isn\`t that the root cause of the problem, serving and taking care only for ones ""believed or look  like our own?  The foundation of all the evil you had pointed out above in the world religion, the selective goodness?

 A person with ""**kindness**"" as a dominant trait would shower it for everyone alike,  as a flower cant be selective in spreading its fragrance to  the audience of its choosing.

Humans are consciously evolved beings, powered by probably the universes most sophisticated nervous system, & backed by a vast database of genome & cellular memories. 

They can discern, choose consciously,  exert intent, they posses great will power, have the ability to introspect and make discoveries. 

That innate power or toolkit is granted to almost every being born of the human womb. No matter the prevailing economic condition, race, geography, or any other external circumstances, this set of toolkit with optimum functioning is available to everyone by birth.

Example, ever ask a child or toddler to kill a bird or conduct this act in-front of her, and it  would not matter which race or religion this child belongs to, they all will show a similar reaction, and express themselves similarly.

That\`s the natures **""inner toolkit**"" working providing hints to ""**right direction /Choices**"" 

You see that every human is in possession of this toolkit, though a lot of us choose to forget using these over the time under the societal conditioning.

Which is sadly driven by the selfish principles like ""acting in pure self interest"" and taking care of those who look like us or believed to be of our own kind""...

Then why do you assert my friend,  that onus of all the wrong in the world is on the **religion(s)** and ""**historical humans**"" who said some words, or asked people like you and me to follow  a certain path.

Why not try and apply all these gifts of chromosomes inbuilt in us, to evaluate & choose for ourselves. Running their discourse on the logic, historical and geographical evidences, experiences and other tools available. - Scientific discovery essentially.

As far as all the misery of the world is concerned, root cause of it everywhere would be the individuals selfishness, and ignoring the hints provided by this inner toolkit. *aka, that faded voice from heart*

We under the influence of **selfishness enticed by greed** , ignored these hints from our innate toolkit, for so long that sadly it has stopped coming anymore for most part...

So, now we are left on the mercy of **""Books""**, **"" scriptures""** and self proclaimed gurus... 

There was a time when there were no books or written scriptures, everyone was relying on the **hints provided by this innate toolkit..**

and then greed and selfishness flashed and some one, at some point, for the first time, must have dared to ignore the hints from inner toolkit and decided to chose otherwise.. That\`s how it begin!

Rest copied, the trend followed and it took us all here... those opposed were ignored or crushed! This is what modern history tells us.

That\`s how & (why must have )  written religious scriptures,  avatars, gurus,  happened on different point of this timeline of deliberate corruption  & suppression of **""inner hints""**

The scriptures and avatars are there to just to remind us humans that we possess a unique toolkit but we are forgetting to use it, and it is not good for us in the long term....

You see, all the religions on this planet in their depths have only pointed us humans to listen to  ""**this inner toolkit**"", where real knowledge happens.

Eventually, some day in the future, a majority of humans will find a way to pay attention to the hints coming from this inner toolkit. 

And all fake knowledge and religions creating illusion of different paths will collapse. As everyone would have the access to the truth and one end. 

In nutshell, all the religion in their current format are serving a purpose, which is to guide humans to somewhere, point them in some direction, and alluring them to walk a path of their choosing...

Apparently, those who were entrusted with the authority to continue poke and remind humans about this core stuff  got corrupted themselves /Stopped listing to their inner toolkit..Some got hijacked (influence of greed / Self interest ) 

In present format majority of these custodians of the original message are only disclosing what suits their interest.

Which is,  taking people to the different extended recursive paths while smartly hiding the essence.  Fitting their vested interests. 

And that\`s causing all the confusion & creating this massive illusion that end destination is also a different place at the end of every path. 

You would see...

yet, IMO, every individual  still has got some access left to this toolkit. We all agree that everyone who lived in the end has to die. All path must converge to one. As all rivers of the world become one water in the vast ocean. 

There are everyday experiences we chose to ignore. 

Those who would continue to ignore ""this hint from the inner toolkit""  will continue to be confused and disillusioned... 

 Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. 

Evil = Bad, and Right = Good  today are mere a label we put to our action based on its outcome. if they suit our interest, label it as good act, otherwise a bad one., isn\`t so!

Does any other animal labels any of their act as a good or a evil ? 

As evident from the above, all the labels of evil and good are inside us, this hint coming from ""**inner toolkit**""  had always picked up the right label without a fail. Or else majority of humans would have been murderers, thieves,  and humanity would not have made this far!

Point is, that nothing is that bad externally, we have chose to ignore the majority of these inner hints as they contradict with our modern definition of good and bad. (Selective / always in self interest ) 

Recent population explosion across the globe has added mostly this ""type(s) of human""  one heavily conditioned  with no support of this **""inner toolkit""** and hence all the chaos we see in the world, as no one has got a clue about what is right or wrong. It is pure selfishness and greed. 

It is us as individuals, who need a fix. 

Start with giving importance to the hints originating from **""Inner toolkit""** which is far more superior and work of millennium of evolution. Sir, so how many pills did you say you have left? Sir...? I believe in Buddhism, not for the myths and legends, but for what it teaches and for its values. Do you think I'm ""stupid"" for believing so? No body else gonna mention how he said fuck Buddhism? But then proceeds to say that all that matters is lovong life in the moment on this earth?? THATS WHAT BUDDHISM IS ABOUT! Making the life you live HERE on EARTH as powerful and meaningful as possible. Do research before you spew hate filled shit all over things you dont even understand. Yeah I still believe in a rebirth sorry Religion is control “Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny.“

So free will? As it was written in the Bible.
And no one where in the Bible did it say we can’t advance as a species? 

And religion doesn’t divide us. It’s sin. Not being left, right, colored, poor, rich. It’s the sinful nature of mankind that fucks up the world. I don't believe in religion, but I respect it, a good person is judged on how you treat others imo, I don't need to believe in religion to accomplish that. Try to live your life as happy as possible, as a kid once said if you can't be happy due to a disability, there is thousands of other things that can make you happy. RIP Sam Berns. Your thoughts are no different from those believing in a certain religion and is much closer to those which believe every other one is wrong. Being here in the now is pretty much the basis of all religion. Chill. Agree. You are kind if summarizing the teachings of Buddhism. K Fuck Prayer rooms. 

Fuck Vaastu. 

Fuck Beef Brigade. Tell me how did the universe start Why are you so mad I don’t understand why you are so upset. You’re kind of doing the same thing as religions would do which is telling people to leave their belief and join yours. Chill Religion =\= spirituality. One can believe there is some higher power or energy without succumbing to an organized religion, and should not be judged or discriminated for doing so. Your first three paragraphs are just an angry version of the core teachings of Buddhism.

Not sure what Buddhists your familiar with, but impermanence and understanding your connection to the universe is literally the closest thing to enlightenment words can describe.

Just so you're aware. People will find a way to divide without religion and I say that as an atheist. If you destroyed religion it would be race, if you destroyed race it would be nationalism, if you destroyed nationalism it would be ethnicity, then language, and so and so forth.

Humans hate.  Religion didn't make us do that.  Hell, many religions are actively trying to get us to stop.

The Nazis didn't need religion to cause the holocaust, or Stalin the holodomor, or the Chinese the cultural revolution.

Humans are the key shitty factor here, not religion. Religion doesn't divide. It depends on who is using it for what ends. 

Don't forget that the largest mass murders were committed by atheists: Mao and Lenin.

Atheist governments can also manipulate humans to murder and hate others because of race, class, etc... Fuck i hope this coronavirus kills all the fucking oldies with their fortified faith in religion potentially bringing in better generation adults into play. Uhm ok? Yep. Couldn't have said it better myself

Cheers I hope I am not too late.

You sure it's just the religion?

God is dead by Nietzsche led to Nazism.

Fuck Nationalism https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=yq4uCWtQE24 lol just let people believe what they want But have you ever tried DMT? Be careful of making progress your religion No. There are SPECIFIC countries causing world unrest. 

&#x200B;

USA (Christian)

Russia (Christian)

China (Atheists) Does religion corrupt people or do people corrupt religion?

I think people will find an excuse to be ignorant and shitty regardless of religion. If it wasn’t Jesus or Allah it would just be something else.

Look at celebrities, famous youtubers, Trump, Bernie, Reddit, corporations, brands, computers, literally anything. People are willing to argue, preach, fight, and die for these with or without conventional organized “religion”.

Who’s to say anything and everything isn’t already some form of “religion”.

People created religion, not the other way around. Even if religion were to magically disappear today, I guarantee it would all start up again in a matter of days with essentially the same shit, just different names.

“Religion” isn’t the problem, it’s people. ?????...... Who hurt you? While I dont disagree with the issues you speak of with religion and who believe it in, I dont believe anyone knows for sure what happens after death. So you really shouldnt say what happens after you die, cause you know...you don't know either. I'd upvote for visibility but downvote for not realizing something simple. So no vote. Shouldnt this be on r/confessions I don’t believe in any god or have a religion but man, this post was just really edgy and kinda sad, just let people believe in stuff, as long as they aren’t hurting people Weird flex my atheist friend, people are gonna believe what they want to believe in. No ones certain where the soul/ conciseness goes when we die, so let us be creative, let us use some imagination. Is it really harming anyone, if it brings peace of mind to people of faith I don't want to sound ironic but, you do know that atheism is technically a religion right?  this sounds like of a closed minded person who's Seriously angry and can't keep it to himself. I resent atheists but I don't go around screaming it at the top of my lungs. 90% of adult life is learning how to bite your tongue and sit on your emotions, And this person sounds like he seriously failed at that. Reddit moment Religion is not perfect. People are not perfect.

>If religion, instead of being the manifestation of a  spiritual ideal, gives prominence to scriptures and external rites, then  does it disturb the peace more than anything else.”

– Rabindranath Tagore This ideology could be a religion in and of itself 0.0

The religion of non-religion. You have as much proof that God doesn't exist then a religious person has that he does. That means zero. You have the right to believe whatever you want, and the right to not believe in anything. But your way of thinking isn't superior to that of one who thinks God exists. This post is very condescending, narcissistic, and shows lack of open-mindedness rather than the intended open-mindedness. It's very little and shows lack of character and a superiority complex. You're not special, and neither are religious people. But what you are that most religious people are not, is disrespectful. I don't it's possible for our star to die in a supernova explosion. It's too small. NOW WHAT!? You and your ilk have a warped concept of what religion is and its purpose. Religion does not establish a nation, it establishes an individual. It is the foundational practice of philosophies that is keeping you alive and making this shit post. All your plights about the history's problems are a result of politics and the absence of religion. I predict your argument: ""look at all the nations and historical events predicated on religion"". Proceed to make that argument and make a fool of all yourselves. They way you spoke about religion was childish. I have to remind myself these are your beliefs or views that you are expressing here and good luck with that. Beautiful It’s crazy but Buddhists Christians Hindus and Jews all life in peace with one another. Didn't read lol

Are you one of those fedora-wearing neckbeards fighting fUnDiEs on the internet? Now that's a sad, pointless waste of time Grumpy bear just joined the chat. *CRAWLIIIIIING INNN  MY SKIIIIIN* Coming from a religious guy, I feel like I’d rather be believing in something that isn’t true and spend my life optimistic for the future with no fear of death than to believe this is it and I’m just destined to be lifeless dust floating in space and who I am will be irrelevant when I die. Just seems depressing to live like that imo. Euphoric I believe in the New Game + Did anyone else read this as Eminem from  the movie 8-Mile

Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer,
fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly

And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty,

Here, tell these people something they don't know about me. This website claims to be so accepting and then a post makes the front of Reddit that is basically straight up shitting on a large some of people that don’t live how the poster wants them to.

Yeah, you fuck off. Fucking hypocrites. We get it dude but seriously... /cringe Not religions fault if followers are idiots to begin with! What is your aim with this post? Any argument that starts with telling people to fuck themselves is going to create nothing but hatred. That's not how you start a constructive conversation. Religion is a powerful thing created by geniuses among us use it wisely it can unit people of different cultures,Color,ideology etc but it can also can cause downfall of a civilisation . ok there goes reddit with its childish anti-religion atheistic boner. Seriously how many brains cell does one need to understand that its humans that are the fucking problem, that if there was no religion i guarantee we would FIND something else to muder each other over? Religion isn't a bad thing. Religion doesn't kill people. People kills people. Religion is just an excuse. Anyway, it's not possible to say if gods exist or not. Just because they don't interfere directly doesn't mean that they don't exist. I agree. But also, fuck India. What a terrible place Sorry I don't have any condoms I agree religion shouldn't be a thing, but you're pushing your own beliefs onto others, saying that what they believe in is dangerous and wrong so they should change to your way of thinking instead. Which is what most religions out there do right now. Just saying. so answer why and how we exist? for what reason People like this act as though religion is the root of all evil. Even religion didn't exist, we'd still fight and kill each other over race, sex, politics, sexuality, and money. 

But sure, act as though we'd be a perfect society if it weren't for one thing. Happy 14th birthday! I mean technically Buddhism is fine with atheism but go off. If it were not for various religions, people as a whole would have difficulty grasping concepts larger than their own life. If your life is being ruined by someone's interpretation of a religion, blame them, not the religion. Ok 😐 Ok I don’t know OP sounds a little closed minded to me. Not advocating for blind faith without critical analysis. Just saying, sometimes there’s valuable information in things we don’t agree with or that don’t sit comfortably with us. edgy I'm amused that this is labeled as politics.

No it fucking isn't. Religion is fiction. Ironic. If there is no God, why does anything you've said even matter? By who's definition is any of it wrong or evil? I’m not up for extremism or violence through religion, but the amount of nihilism resonating from this post is way too much. You can’t lump all the followers with the ones who want to bring about viol and suffering Relax... You seem like a big fan of Ash Wednesday yes sir im on it Nah people are just terrible you don’t need a religion to do that That’s a nice belief you have.. Yo lmfao Religion is not the only things that divides us. So many other things like the color of our skin, sexuality, politics etc. Insults are never the way to convert people. That’s fine we are living in a simulation, so maybe after we “die” on Earth we’ll go to simulated heaven and see all our loved ones. You anti-religion people need to move on to simulation and higher powers in the universe - not a religious god - a higher evolved power that makes us look like amoeba. I don't believe in any God but I respect the people who believe and have faith in supernatural powers. I know you want to say something good but you just sound like a toxic atheist that thinks that everyone who believe in higher powers are stupid. And religion in a lot of cases try to help people, christianism has some teachings, like helping the poor or to not judge others. I think that if people are happy thinking in a way no one should try to force their own beliefs into that person, you believe that there is no God, then be happy with it but don't try to shame others for their religions. Science has given us comfortability and quality of living. It has not given us happiness. 

Religion, the realization and renunciation of the transient nature of our physical enjoyments will give us happiness. 

It is no religion that takes from others, wants to change others, and hate others. There is no religion in blind faith. If it does not lead to love and charity it is not religion. 

There are many organizations across the world that are sincere. Get to know these religions, not the humans who have perverted them. For starters, many Sikhs are beautiful. And I'd love to see you test your atheistic mettle against the Swamis of the Order of Ramakrishna. Some people are religious because of the off chance there is a god, and the eternity in heaven is worth being religious for. If there is a god, I’d be willing to tell him straight up to his face with no guilt, how shit a job he’s doing and that he should be ashamed of himself ! I am of the opinion that religion is a means to control the masses Fuck all atheists who claim to know the answers to the universe. 

You are nothing more than claiming to be a secular prophet who “knows the truth of the universe”. Fuck outta here with your bullshit. Ah, Indian just like American, just pretending that the bad religious people you see on your street reflect all religious people worldwide, while it is just in specific countries where religious become violent. Imagine you are living in a world where no religious person ever had influence on your life and you have never ever seen any criminal or anti social act done by a religious person in the name of his religion. Guess what: I don't hate religion. You know who I hate? People who do wrong, no matter if they are religious or not.

I am atheist, but my mother is not, but she doesn't believe in any religious bullshit, she is just a normal person who is by herself sure that there is a god, but she never wanted anything from me cause of that or others. Every time I see those hate posts about religions, I think about my mother, and question why people would wanna hate her? She is the most loving and caring person I ever met in my life, and my friends and visitors i get all approve that, especially her food ;). Can you imagine how that feel if someone says what your mother does is bad, although it isn't? That is the key problem here, you are saying ALL religion, while you should be angry about the ACTIONS, hating religions means that you are not particular being angry about the ACTIONS that they have done to you, it means that you hate EVERYBODY of them, it means that you hate those WHO NEVER had harmed anybody, who never had imposed their religion on others.

You say to fuck a group of people where there are a majority who have never done anything wrong. And now those people can use that as argument against you, cause you are not particular pointing those things out that are missing in your country WHICH EXIST IN OTHER COUNTRIES, like CLEAR splitting of religion and government. You have practical no idea how life is in a country with splitting of religion and government, AND STILL, you want to hate _ALL RELIGION_, which means you are also hate those people here in Germany who follow a religion that never influenced their life or the life of others. This is despicable and actually helps those people who are really wrong, who abuse religion to get into power who abuse religion to stay in power, cause they just can point to the harmless people an d say ""Why you hate those?""

You are literally hating people for the actions of others, which is the same as racist do. You are like a racist cause you are not pointing to those who did wrong, you point to ALL and say they are all wrong, cause of the actions of other people. All this hate in the world is just disgusting. Be ashamed, inform yourself about the world, and start liking the good parts and pointing to the bad parts, and not point to parts which are used for good and bad in the world just because you are too stupid to open your eyes.

I also want to point out: Isn't it funny how you describe how people should be living together and reflect in those sentences the way religion is used in modern civilization, in those countries which split religion from government. It is kinda disturbing that you have no idea how the world rotates and believe everybody is living in a shithole where religious people take action in the society. Just disturbing and totally stupid to fire up broadsword against people you do not even know, you have no experience with, you just know those in your shithole, but want to condemn those in other countries without even knowing how they are doing in other countries.

I hope you get the hate you spread. Fuck you. It's like blaming on the gun and not the shooter. People (most of them) follow religions as a discipline. However, there are some those who create division and unrest. Best thing is to avoid them. How the fuk do you know pal ? I don’t think religion is the problem, it is humanity that is messed up. Getting mad at religion can be easy, but if you want to be more accurate the issue lies a mother step wider, namely our tribalistic tendencies and power struggles. It just so happens that religion is one form that had been more visible, but more recently blaming religion just sounds like going backwards into more tribalism which is the real issue. Intriguing!! In this entire barb, it is about ""you"" and ""your"". 
Bro, are you the next enlightened one, lookout for followers??
Anyhow, for the rest, this video should be helpful:

[Why religious beliefs are not silly?](https://youtu.be/pLj4iwa0__8) You dont know anything son! Let people believe what they want to believe. Atheism are for the weak, lazy and nihilism that wants to justify their depression, hatred for life, antinatalism and laziness on the fact that we don\`t matter, we are just matter and that nothing matters. It is the coward way to rationalize one's own failure. Wants proof? Atheists have the highest suicide rate than any religious group by far. Failing to coping with depression leads to atheism. It is short-sighted to be so sure in what happens beyond death. We know nothing of our consciousness and it's impossible to say what happens when we die. I am against all religions, but the way that you are so sure of something that science knows nothing about comes close to just another form of religion to me. Agnosticism might be a better way. *claps in american* Fuck India Try some dmt.

You'll eat your views on what you think ""the big picture"" is.

All in all, your view that there's nothing else out there, is just as arrogant and ""silly"" as all those organized religions put together.

It's comical, the irony... Fuckkkk religion they should all burn anyways. A very uninformed understanding of what religion is, although I agree with and empathize with all of your sentiments. Thank you for this! Couldn't agree more

The only reason I can think of for believing in religion is hope. (Old people and the fear of dying, drug addicts that need something to hold onto or people that have had a bad time) Religion is the main cause of unrest worldwide*

Fixed Man, your life truly sounds like it sucks. If someone believes in something and it gives them a better quality of life, then fuck you for saying they can’t. You suck. >Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism.

Thank God I'm a Pagan I'm definitely not religious, but we should let people believe in what they want. Maybe the reason they hold on to their beliefs is because they are scared of dying or it makes them feel safe, cause fuck man death is scary. I know people say they aren't afraid of death, but I find that to be bullshit because I bet when you are sitting right in front of death then we will all be shitting our pants. 

I definitely don't agree with religious people who push their beliefs on us, but it doesn't mean I should tell them their beliefs are dumb because it's what comforts them. I mean who are we to take others comfort and safety away. 

Religion can be evil if used by the wrong people, but for many they only use it to do better. 

Also, if we are all insignificant in the grand scheme of things then why give a fuck about anything at all especially something like religion. Just let people live their lives and do your own thing. Hahaha, what a sad edge-lord. I’ll pray for you even though you’re one of those radical atheists who are as equally stupid as their radically religious counterparts.

Atheists are always full of themselves claiming an open mind and being woke, when really they are just as oblivious. You’re pathetic at the moment, but hopefully you will find some clarity soon.

You can learn from anything. It really isn’t a big deal. People mostly do it because of the chance that there is god. If there isn’t then oh well. r/copypasta What a bunch of terrible and hateful logic by a young teen, people are actually at their most evil without religion, recourse, or law. 150+ million dead to atheistic ideologies by Pol Pot, Stalin, and Mao. Edgy. Cool to know you hold all the answers of the universe. It’s ok to have faith. It’s ok to be afraid of death. It’s ok to congregate with your community. It’s ok to celebrate your culture. It’s religion and it’s rules and outdated beliefs that you do not need. Fuck Reditism Atheists are weak willed people and immoral people that thinks that just because the universe is big it means sentient life doesn't matter. Atheism is the first step to sociopathy and later to psychopathy. I am glad i saw the light and converted from atheism to christianity some time ago Religion, much like various cultures, are constructed based on the reigning norms and values of that society. However much like various cultures, they eventually obscelesse. I just hope the whole world one day will say this Calm down, my friend. Technically being atheist is also a religiou Breaking news as /r/India suddenly becomes /r/atheism from 10 years ago Yeah, I remember when I was 14 Lmao if I said that my parents they would whoop my ass, I somewhat do agree with you tho. I agree but also believe that money is a big contributor to what's holding back humanity. Because it creates greed. If we could just worked together as one people we could contribute so much more to the world and the future of humanity as a whole. You should join my cult. You know what I figured out? Gods are that imaginary friend you need support from when you're going through hard times. 
That's it. The whole thing is based around this Says the curry eater It’s been about a decade since I’ve become non-religious, but this type of stuff gets on my nerves. You explain how little value human life has and proceed to make the argument that religion has ended countless lives. I promise you, we are just as clueless, our actions just as arbitrary, and our minds are just as closed, if not more, than the most religious people on Earth. Sir this is a Wendy’s


(also what’s up with reddit and religion hating neck beards?) You can't force someone to leave their religion. I see a lot of anger in your post. You say God is not real. I understand where you're coming from. A lot of people use religion as justification or reasons for doing something or not doing something. The real answer is this: life is empty and meaningless. Does this mean God isn't in your life? Maybe. Religion doesn't start violence. Interpretation of religion does.

You say with full conviction that there is nothing after death.

Have you ever died before???

What you wrote is just your opinion not fact and a total bulshit.

Read Bible, Kuran, Gita. Hopefully, it will open your mind. [removed] There’s really nothing wrong with Buddhism, They don’t even believe in a god, it’s a nice religion( more of just a way of life tho), it doesn’t really belong in this category with the others lol On which premise we base morality? Why not suicide and bring it all with you? >Awww so badass
Abe Facebook pe post kar na dum hai toh lmao

.


>He got gold, silver and all that too
He's preaching to people who already do that

>That's like me telling you not follow modi
If he was discussing religion like we do then it would have been okay.


>But preaching to them ki ""fuck your religion""
Arey Reddit pe vaise he naastik baithe hain

Ye sab aap apne relatives se boliye na If you think the religionists have fucked up the most, wait till you read what the godless (read communists) have heaped on the world. At the end of the day, humans are bad for humanity. The conventional wisdom of bad vs good and evil vs good are blase. The politics of religion (or its absence) is the root cause of all these evils. Forget about religion, forget about spirituality, enjoy your moment under the sun as the only continuum, then you are safe from all fears and fearmongering. I would argue that religion is not what causes problems, stagnant civilizations, wars and murders. Bigotry is. People kill each other because of the unwillingness to accept that the other guy has just as much right to believe what they believe. Silence stagnates when people are unwilling to be open to new ideas. Cultures divide when we can't accept differences. Bigotry is not unique to religion. So I would argue, let's address the real enemy or else it will perpetuate even if all religions die off. Dude, you tell me to open your mind and ""come back to the real world"". Your real world sucks ass. It's a fallen world. This isn't the true world. It's apparent you need to open your mind. 

Also, isn't this an abuse of rule 3? This is literally hate mongering. WORD!!! Some people literally need religion because they have nothing else and wouldn't be able to cope with their reality otherwise. Well, you're going to be foaming out the mouth when you learn about Baha'i.

Not Indian, just saw this on r/popular, but: fuck you. Scapegoating is wrong. Very mature and elegant. wow you are so cool retard You make atheism sounds so twatish though. Not a coincidence that [most psychopaths are atheist](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/health/atheists-religion-study.amp.html) 

Keep your science fairy tale to yourself. Your weak theory (which is what it is, a theory) of the Big Bang is from a cult leader. But have yall ever tried DMT tho? Looks like somebody just finished reading Sapiens I was once an aethist, now agnostic. 
You cannot blame religion based on what people do. Want to know what Islam is? Read Quaran, want to know what Hindusim is? Read Vedas, Gita, and scriptures. Read Bible to know what Christianity preaches.
People are trash, they never go beyond their ignorance. 
Religion is not a set of rules, it's a lifestyle. Non religion preaches hate and bigotry. 
It's people who use religion as a weapon. 
As far as I have studied hinduism it goes way beyond life and death. From Ayurveda to astronomy from philosophy to physiology every aspect is covered regarding human life and death and beyond. We need to clear the fog. Religion is a set of rules and a moral compass to follow when you feel like you can't handle a situation alone. What you see on TV isnt religion. What you see people murder each other over isn't religion. It's sad and I hate it. Religion is something personal between you and the world we live in. You speak too much for a person who knows too little. /r/im14andthisisdeep Lol some kind of a fucking pathetic simp got mad when he lost a game of fortnite. Go fuck urself 14 yrs old kid I'm literally scrolling through Popular and came across this. Dafuq is going on in India? You can disagree but....damn dude, chill Fuck you. Cringe. Couldn't have said it better Imagine having.your wife burned because you.died before her Yea let people have their thing but leave me out of it.  I know but i don’t care. Fuck people who don't believe in a higher power. Amen! Hello from America, I feel the exact same way. Really no need to come at religion with you uninformed opinion because your insecure about yourself. Pledge your hearts to Satan my fellow heathens. If you think like that why even keep living? This post did not make me leave my religion. Islam teaches good manners, its brought me love and respect. Contentment without jealousy. Even if you don't believe in the afterlife (which you can't disprove either) the teachings alone are worth passing down. I think my favorite part is “nothing divides us expect religion” except ya know politics, cultures, personal beliefs on how to live, shall I go on this is a really poor argument on your part. Read The Law of One. ""Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.""

How do you know that's what happens? The old “I don’t agree so fuck you argument”. Why does crap like this get so many likes? Edgy and soypilled Raised in the church, left the church tne slowly re read the bible after a bunch of philosophers (athiests) quoted certain bits.   


Certainly dont think its all great but many good tales and lessons in there with god excluded. & i would add suicide rates are much higher amongst athiest communities than not. You forgot to fuck judism. Edit ur post. Buddhism actually isnt a religion. Side note it’s been conferred by scientist many times that theirs a grand being responsible for our creation on top of thousands of other arguments that just completely invalidates you argument, better luck next time.  The only reason I can think of for believing in religion is hope. very reddit of you Ok mr athiest r/im14andthisisdeep I'm waiting for this to become a copypasta. Let me remind you that Zionism was founded by an atheist ((Theodor Herzl) and this same ideology uses religion in many context to justify its relevance! Spare us your BS and start advocating for atheism when atheists come up with something constructive, not an ideology that created the most twisted society and an apartheid entity! 

Your use of science to promote atheism is just but a trick to give your idea some credibility! It works with some but not with all! Let’s go Judaism >Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species.

WHITE POWER! My biggest problem with religion is how so many of them clearly push the message across that we are all equal/treat others how you wish to be treated. But the majority case is, we are all equal, unless you're a woman, non-hetrosexual, from a foreign country or believe in a different religion. Religion is the main cause for division in the world, Christians hating muslims, jews fighting islamics, and so much more. On top of this the catholic and Christian churchs(maybe others too?) have been massive door stops in the evolution of scientific research. I support the peace religion tries to express, but the methods are far too skewed. Fuck buddhism ?

For what ? I'm an occultist Wow very well written and I couldn’t have said it better myself! It makes me angry that I’m in my 20s and my mom still tries to force religion on me saying that I got the good job I have now because of god...no mother I got it because of ME because I worked hard and got it.  Stop giving god all the credit and understand I made it happen.  The way she talks about god and religion would shock you.  Its as if she’s convinced everything in the Bible is the truth and she even said no one’s going to convince her otherwise.  But it’s sad because she’s been abused by different people nearly her whole life, doesn’t like where she is now and that’s why she needs to hold on to religion.  She just wants somewhere to belong and to hold onto.  I just can’t wait until the day we all die and realize there’s nothing.  I wish I’d be able to see the look on her face. Imagine thinking you know anything The word religion. There are so many interpretations of that word. There is the Catholic religion, the Christian, the Protestant and the innumerable divisions of Protestantism, and there is Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhs and so on. So many religions in the world, organised, some are brutal, the Islamic world and so on. So what do you consider is religion, the word? Is it the search for human beings something outside of their own daily life, something other than their petty self-centred activity, beyond their cruelty, bestiality and their vulgarity and all the rest of that? Is it that human beings have always sought from the most ancient of times something beyond themselves? If we consider that, something beyond themselves, beyond their daily life, then that becomes a religion of escape, which probably most religions are, as they are now. It is not connected with their daily existence. It is based on belief, on a book, or on faith, or on some dogma, rituals, the repetition of daily rituals which goes on practically all over the world - incense, dressing up, fancy dress and all that. All that, prayer included, is called leading a religious life, going, as they do in India at one time three times a day to the temple, and the Islamic world five times prayer, and the Sunday mass and so on. So this is considered religious, or rather a religious attitude. We are questioning that.

I would like rather to question the whole nature and the structure of present day religion. There are so many sects. They have found that Christianity is very limited, so they go off to Buddhism, or to some kind of sectarian gurus and so on, the multiplication of this search for something other than the daily boredom, daily loneliness, the constant conflict and so on. This has been the pattern. - Jiddu Krishnamurti 


https://jkrishnamurti.org/content/what-religion-you/Religion%20 Amen! God isn’t your imaginary friend, he’s your imaginary enemy.

An Imaginary Friend is a friend who will listen to your troubles, and are the only kind of friends I have. Oh, it wouldn't feel like r/popular if there wasn't at least one post bashing on religion. I’ve noticed most non religious or anti religious people I’ve met have one thing in common: they are not okay with the idea of having no control of their lives. They want to have full control and refuse to give that up. 

But we don’t... and that’s just how life is. God (or whoever/whatever you believe in) forbid you or I or anyone experiences the loss of someone and we really can’t do much to ABSOLUTELY avoid Or prevent it. 

We have to think more positively. You don’t have to believe, but you can at least respect the fact that others do. 

We can’t control what happens in life, but we are given full control of how to react to it. I wish I could upvote this 5000 times! Seems to me like you speak the language of your colonizers. Look deeper, think deeper. When did these problems begin? Don’t look for scapegoats. What messed you up isn’t religion, it is an agenda that was put in place before you ever graced this planet. Religion can bring good of it is used properly, look at Martin Luther King Junior or Malcolm X. Faith gave strength to people long before you, but you spout what your colonizers brainwashed you with. Wake up. Don’t think you are better than anyone else or that you have it all figured out. Atheism is also a religion, don’t delude yourself, because you read a few books or watched some TedTalks meant to influence people into leaving their creed and the only thing that comforts them. It is the settler/colonial system that makes us hate one another, because it’s easier to divide us to conquer us. k Like it or not, freedom of speech and freedom of thought is a double edged sword. I understand where your frustration stems from. I want to rid this country of divisive thoughts as much as you do. But we have to be better than them. We cannot speak in the same tone as they do. We have to stand up for our rights and rights of people that we don't agree with. That is the price of democracy. imo religion has always been a 'law' of sorts to govern the poor and uneducated back when it was established. 

I don't mind ppl who feel the need to find a belief or escape. it becomes a problem when it's an obsession, or wrong interpretation of the overall meanings or forcing an interpretation onto others. 

religion should not be more than 10% of your life. Ok mom Interesting... ""Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism."" but you failed to mention Judaism... Seems like just an advertisement for another sub. Some of you guys make religion sound like the root of all evil, while terrible things have been done in the name of religion in the past there are plenty of good religious people who have helped society in a literally uncountable amount of ways lol the sun won't blow into a super nova. Religion was more powerful in the past. It's more about money now. Wealth is the divider these days. Humanism is it’s own religion. Buddhism is not a religion As if humans needed Religion to commit atrocity in the name of a ""cause""...for all your scientific theory you seem to understand very little about human nature.

Religion isn't the ""cause"" of anything it's a *tool* occasionally used by w/e ""powers"" as a convienent form of manipulation based in fear. Religion is factually nothing but a set of beliefs...general beliefs can and do exist outside of such constructions & would easily take it's place manifest in some other form.

I'm not religious but this seems (objectively) to be little more than an emotionally rooted kneejerk to pin the tail on a target for some personal pain. There is no god and I am his prophet right? In the name of religion a lot of people were killed agreed.

The epitome of scientific advancement contributed by the best scientists of the time, led to the invention of Nuclear weapons that killed a lot too.

So now are you going to say science is bad because people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were killed? No, you would tell , science was used for the wrong purpose.

Same way, it's simple. When religion is used for wrong reasons, wrong things can happen.

Beautiful communities are formed through religion too, there is unity too.. it's not always fight between religions or for a religion.

My opinion is we should look at a bigger picture and be more considerate.

Have a good day. “Fuck Buddhism”

“You are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is bigger than you could fathom”

[???](https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/46407983/Nick-Young) question, what drives your morality if you believe all will be dust in the end? Religion and it’s values, belief and fear in a higher power are what have brought society to where it is today. I’m non religious myself but you sound like an angsty teenager who thinks he’s found the solution to world peace. Spoiler alert, it’s not that simple and you’re not that smart or original for thinking it All religion will fuck you in return. People believe because idea of life being just this and that we are only one responsible for what we are doing scare the shit out of them. They rather believe in higher plan and some almighty overseer. I remember when I was 12. Weeb Wow so euphoric. Well to be fair buddhism isn't really a religion... It's really about just being more in tune with yourself and your community. It's more of a philosophy like taoism or confucianism. Edgy Fuck all religion. All hail economic ideologies 100% Cool story bro. So edgy. Religion isn’t bad *per se*. It’s been a thing since the primitive man was thinking. Modern religion is not the same as it was in the beginning; it was a way to ascend man to a cosmic level, to live forever, and many more things. Nowadays it’s just a vestige of that, stopping progress and shit. 
I would not call them “childish beliefs”, true religion is a beautiful and interesting thing as seen from a anthropological and psychological perspective. 

Religion as economics and imposition is another thing. >A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa.

No. The fossil record has been updated more than once.

https://www.natureasia.com/en/nmiddleeast/article/10.1038/nmiddleeast.2018.15 Religion does suck. I don't believe in ""God"" but I don't hate on others for it. Live and let live type of thing. When it encroaches on my space I make it very clear that I would like no part of it. Mainly because nobody knows and therefore they are talking out of their ass. Hoes mad Let people believe what they want, if they’re not hurting anyone then why does it matter? This is exactly why I detest atheists. I don’t have a religion, I follow my own belief. But by far this absolutely harsh ideology is forcing your own beliefs just as others forced theirs on you. It makes you no better than them, and to be honest everyone needs to understand it’s not okay to force your beliefs on others.

That’s all that needed to be said, not this rant that slams and insults people that have done nothing to you. I can counter argue that those in some religions would likely have a less brute force approach and not be so callous and reckless with their words. Words hurt others, words start wars, words are like the bullets that provide ammo for evil and tyrannical agendas. 

Take a step back and realize you have no control, this shout into the void is useless. You’re doing it for comfort or recognition which is only temporary in the grand scheme of things. Applause fades, the curtains close, and you’re left standing there feeling good about yourself for the wrong reasons. 

The best way to detest religion is not to recognize them at all or give the energy you have up in an attempt to put them “on blast” so to speak. You don’t believe, good for you, many others are like you. But just because you don’t believe doesn’t mean others CAN’T believe. Stop trying to cause a stir in such a rude and disrespectful way out in the open and instead find a way to put that energy into something that will actually make a difference.


Have a great day. I think you got the date wrong about when we left Africa Good on you for you opinion. I'm no motherfucking devout religious sanyasi but hey atleast I don't write conceited posts shitting on other people's beliefs. Everyone's opinion is just as valid as yours. You're an atheist? Great. Good on you. Some people are Christians, some Hindus. Good on them too. Having different opinions doesn't make you superior to anyone. Fuck buddhism? I have always believed and always will that humans are meant to work together and the only legacy that matters is the one where you've ensured some kind of positive change for the future of our species. If nothing matters and we’re all going to die anyway who cares if some people are religious. shut up cracker You are free to believe or not believe in whatever you want, but this is such a boiled down to nothing take. You act like being a good Samaritan and advancing society is not possible while being religious, which is super dumb. You arent that smart for throwing out human history and the way u frame it makes you sound like a 13 year old white kid who doesnt have a lot to offer besides condescending snide comments; that and you come off as zelous and insane as the preachers and religious leaders of older times that ostracised and killed others for following their own practice( in your case lack of practice). Again you are free to put your time and faith in anything u want, religion or science, but you make non religious science praising athiests sound real dumb. Could use with a touch of less unnecessary nihilism and a ""nothing matters i a cog in the machine of the universe"" air to your ideas, cuz you are defintely not keeping an open mind. Based Live and let live. That is why we has this beautiful thing called freedom of religion in America. If someone's beliefs do not directly impact you, live at peace with them. Just as vehement as you are atheist, there are the same who are religious. You are not entitled to be right just because you are upset that people think differently. Grow up, and realize that people have the right to believe what they want, despite how upset it makes you. You are not preaching love, you are preaching hate of people who view the world differently. We are not all the same (genetics will tell you that). Religion is the real world, as it is ingrained within cultures throughout the world. People have believed in a creator for thousands of years. If it makes you feel better to be an atheist, more power to you. But do not tell me (or anyone else) how to live their lives, because in effect, you are doing EXACTLY that which you are criticizing. My 2 cents

I don't even know where to begin. Further more, I think that most don't realise the kind of argument you guys are putting forth.

I kinda understand where this thought begins but tbh it is just as good as any other scapegoat. We are so desperate to find a solution out of the misery and problems we are surrounded by that we make another scapegoat. The way in which responses are written in this thread shows the other bitter side of the coin.

From a completely neutral point of view, advocating for the removal of religion is as radical of an idea as some religion advocating for the banishment of the other religion (like what you see in the events unfolding). BUT wait... you could say, I as a non-religious ""unbiased person"" am seeking betterment for the society (I will overlook the way everyone on this thread places moral anchorage as if something like that even exists in this viewpoint - ""good and bad?"" What are those terms?), anyway, back to the point, you have done the same by placing yourself on a false pedestal dictating the terms and the way you present them as absolute.

So...

What is the true solution if you want to dismantle any , and I mean any false beliefs?
Simple - Engage in discussion and do not throw some belief out of the window or portray it as radical just because you don't like it. This way, we can have a society that actually progresses by engaging with the other and not by ""marginalising"" the other. Calling our groups to hate and laugh on the ideas of the other can also not lead to a harmonious society. Remember, you can come to similar terms on many issues by talking and listening to the other with an intent to understand

PEACE and I'm out Bruh for an ideology that doesn't belive in something they sure also hate it a lot. Nice opinion bruh. Don’t forget the most common modern religion to take over; Scientism. People think science will save humanity as much as a Omnipotent being will. You could easily replace the views of former generations of “don’t worry god will save us” with the modern view of “don’t worry science will save us”. Most people don’t realize the concepts are exactly the same. Also the same as UFO believers. “Don’t worry aliens will save us”. 

We’ve not grown spiritually at all in the last 1k years and I would argue we have digressed. You can see even you the op have your bias toward science in your post. Belief in science can be just as dangerous and honestly are exactly the same as belief in religion.

There’s nothing wrong with any of the views to be honest though. You don’t really hate religion, as they all serve a purpose. You hate peoples need to push their views on others and the childish behavior of always having to be right no matter the logic. Fuck that immature view instead! Well said. Show me on this teddy bear where the priest touched you Hey i hate religion and think it should be totally abolished. But you don’t know what happens when we die and it’s annoying when atheists say shit like “you know happens when we die, we just black out and that’s it”.

Yes we know what will happen to your body but no one knows what does it could happen when we die. It’s the one question we may or may never get answered. I'm not a believer myself, but shitting on someone else's belief is not cool man, not cool. You think you sound reasonable, but your tone mirrors that of an extremist in a religious sect. Sounds like a budding daoist to me. For all we have is reality, cast aside everything but reality. This is what I believe in!! I absolutely despise religious beliefs for the sole reason that in a country like India , in today's time, people go around wearing this tag of ' I am a ___' and ask others about their religious beliefs...and like in my family being atheist is like being arrogant like wtf?! My mom is a hardcore religious person and I am a hardcore atheist Bec of all the madness that goes around in the house under the name of this so called fucked up religion. 
I believe in Energy that thrives in the universe and of course KARMA ;-) Lol yo chill Fuck religion. Nice post Most religions that exist today (100s of them) don't even believe in the afterlife, so their point has nothing to do with death or immortality. Religions are made because the humans needed hope. The hope, that all of this has a meaning. They needed a guide how to behavior in life, to find peace in the death. But greed corrupted it, the humans themself did it, and if there is a god or more, humans wouldn‘t be able to life by their wills without corrupting it. Today, it‘s a tool to control the masses. But how do you know that you blackout and cease to exist after death? Calling all religion childish for what they believe of the afterlife and then imposing you know exactly what happens after death is arrogance. You're no better than the very thing you're complaining about.

Ultimately no one knows what happens after death and no one will ever be able to know until you die yourself. So what's wrong with hoping for something peaceful, especially when the entire concept of non existence is an unknown and scary thought to the vast majority. A good friend of mine who I care for has anxiety attacks from just thinking of this concept of unending blackness of nothingness. So what's wrong with finding peace in thinking of something different?

Personally I'm agnostic. Because theres no way to know, I dont think its logical to claim anything with certainty solely based off what anyone believes is true. But I dont think theres anything wrong with hoping for peace in the afterlife especially if it gives you peace of mind while you're alive.

Edit: After reading through the rest of your post I agree with mostly everything else, but i still dont think it's right to generalize religion like that. I agree the extreme side of religion is bad. There is a problem with anything when it turns into tribalism. Or when it makes people ignorant and unable to live in reality. But if people are keeping to themselves and helping others find peace in some way, then I see nothing wrong. Especially when there are a lot of good churches who help those in need with their personal problems, somewhat in the same way as therapy. Not only that but there are a lot of good messages that some churches preach, that dont necessarily even have anything to do with religion but are just simple messages of be a good person and love one another. Add caste to the list too.. That bullshit needed to be banished long ago... At this point it's more dangerous than a bad of heroin Post this on r/theydidthefuckyou What if I told you figuring out how to behave is way harder than knowing how from the start I am 31 and still recovering from the damage Christianity has done to me since I was a child.  One of the most unfortunate parts of religion is that it allows people to not take responsibility for the bad AND the good things that happen in life. It becomes a problem when you attribute all of your successful decisions in life as “the hand of god” because you never quite feel powerful enough to reach your fullest potential and happy self.   Like you couldn’t possibly have done well without help from some external force that’s smarter and braver than you.  They literally take children, break down their self esteem and make it so that the only people who can understand you are the other people in their loony bin called the church.  I once told my mother that using religion to raise your children is cowardly and lazy.  She didn’t take that very well.  
        When you get out of religion like I did, initially you are free and relieved. But then you struggle immensely dealing with reality.  No one ever taught you how to deal with your emotions properly and it takes a long time to appreciate living in doubt and uncertainty.  You spent all of your important developing years being brainwashed.   Religion is fucking evil.  It is for the weak and mentally ill.  Don’t let anyone tell you any differently. hey fuck you too As an atheist I agree with much of what you have written, though your grammar needs a bit of work. 
But many of your statements are inaccurate: just because some aspects of this life and death are unknown at this time does not mean we will not discover their underlying truths in the future.
However, your self-righteous attitude is not one that will succeed. Calling to religious believers' attention the myriad wrongs of religion will not convince them to seriously consider your argument.
And why should they?
Please think about this: most humans who have lived, or are now living, have an overriding goal in life to live as long and as happily as possible. 
So there you stand on a street corner waiting for the walk signal with an elderly person. When the two of you begin to cross the street, are you going to take away your fellow traveler's crutches and state they should not be used because you don't need them?
Though certainly far from perfect, religion helps millions of good people get along in this world. Who are we to deny them their peaceful and often kind and thoughtful way of living? 100 % agree. why do u guys send unwanted dick pics to everyone Copypasta Trump visits India.

Reddit: fUcK iNdIa AnD yOuR rElIgIoN! I use to believe exactly the same shit you do...use to...and now that I know the truth, I feel bad for you I don't believe in religion but everyone believes in something.
Some believe in money, some believe in science and some in religion.
The issue is not in believing something but imposing your beliefs on others. The expectation that everyone around you should believe in the same thing is what's causing the unrest in India. AND FUCK ATHEISM. Just live and let live. Wow! You have it all figured out. You should write about your wisdom, share it and gather followers. Temper temper. Religion or not, man is evil, does evil. Sure, people are good and do good too but left unchecked, without the God(s), Man will revert to bestiality. The common law and government only work when everybody buys into it.  Which is why we need schools, to ensure everybody buys into it from an early age.

Otherwise the idea that one can own property is meaningless fiction. But we strive toward that fiction and it is the basis for our society. More property, more status, more wealth, more police to safeguard it, more military to ensure outsiders don't claim it, and more religion to propagate the myth that God wants this.

But whether there is a God or not, whether it cares or not, is up for debate. What is not is that people left unchecked will always result in them exploiting others in whatever form s/he can for their own benefit. God, as we commonly imagine, possibly is an Alien. Wow.  Breakin new ground there..... Ok streetshitter Cringe atheist Gonna cut yourself on all that edge u/koalakitty84 Ok I don’t believe in religion. But I believe there were civilization on our planet about 12-15k years ago. We were advanced enough to build pyramids and many other megalithic things. 

We were a global civilization, but some natural disaster happened. 90% of the population got wiped out. We started from ground zero being cave man again. All the amazing technology became stories, and stores became legends and some became religions today The first perpetrator of religion has blood of millions soaked in his hands. Dude. I say this shit all the time. It’s all made up bullshit. Except I don’t get a thousand rewards for it. > Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.


My only serious question for you is this:

How do you know? Preach man I strongly disagree, but respect your right to hold that opinion; and see no reason why we couldn’t get along. 

See? We’re not so bad :p 100% agree edgy teenager alert H.P. Lovecraft's entire horror is based on the idea that human existence is insignificant. Why do atheists love to trot this idea out like its a good thing? Not sure if religion is bad in its entirety.But, what I'm sure about is that it's being misused for gains. That's the real issue. Education might be one of the potent solutions. Christian here, I have a couple of questions.

Why does religion mean close minded?

Why does religion mean evil?

You say that after we die nothing happens. Have you experienced death before to back up your claim? Just because a religion is responsible for a war doesn't mean all religious people deserve to be hated. How can you be so sure there is no afterlife when you haven't experienced death yourself?

Don't get me wrong, I believe the same as you, but you can't just say you're right just because you think it is the most logical answer. All I see when I read this is arrogance and nonacceptance of a societal norm that isn't going to go away if you insult it. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  said :

“If religion becomes a cause of dislike, hatred and division, it were better to be without it, and to withdraw from such a religion would be a truly religious act”. Angry Redditor is angry at religion. Then again what do you know? Fuck nationalism! This dude would be in nazi germany and say fuck you to the jews Damn, I'm an Atheist but let people believe in what they want bro. Sounds like OP read the book 'Sapiens' You couldn’t be more right. I agree but Buddhism shouldn’t be grouped with any of those. Especially Abraham if religions. Buddhism is more of a mindset than a religion. I trust in God. Still. Hey, if you are feeling this way reach out to like minded people. You'll feel just slightly better I promise. > [DISCOVER YOUR TRUE IDENTITY](https://youtu.be/Rf3HR6bAd4Y)

[Be like 🦋](https://youtu.be/crPfz52a32c), [fly with both wings](https://youtu.be/7zY9A28YmFE). People should be able to believe what they want. Insulting one’s religion could be in equivalence to insulting one’s political opinion. Some people pursue religion to seek a purpose in life. Others interpret their religion’s scriptures wrong and it stains the reputation of these religions. Preach Buddhism doesn’t really have a concept of life after death, at least not at its core. I have this exact same mind set, I fucking detest religion it has been the source of most wars, murders, rapes and tortures. It has been the source of corruption and inequality I mean “Divine Right of Kings” anybody?

It’s still a fucking source of those things now! 

I let people do what they want, because realistically I can’t stop people doing what they want. But it’s sad that some people are utterly brainwashed and pressured by families and communities and it’s awful seeing the way religion dictates how you should live your life. 

There is no ultimate goal in this universe, no watchful god to tell us our destiny it’s just ramblings in books. We have no purpose, we have to make our own purpose in life for what little time we have and I think religion greatly hinders that. Another reason reason why I hate it. It's not religion, it's ideas. Communism and other political idealogies are responsible for more deaths than religion. No matter what people believe about the afterlife and the divine, they will always find a reason to kill each other Ugh, rubbish post I fucked Religion before a year and I am happy now George said it best.

https://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE Who hurt you? You know you can not believe in the organization of any religion but still be a moral & ethical person as an individual... right? 

You can inspire others to do right on a spiritual level by setting a good example. Leader or show others what you think/believe is the best way to live life and exist. 

However, what business is it of yours if others use their own spirituality or religion to give themselves hope or to have faith... a motivation or purpose for their own existence.  

Spirituality & Faith regardless of a specific religion can, in certain individual cases, be a lifestyle someone of their own free will chooses to just get by and live as best they can.  

Why leave any faith and ""come back to the real world"" if someone's faith and spirituality is their own personal motivation for being a good person, and just being good in general. 

In my personal point of view maybe you should calm down and think about what you wrote down. We are not all the same and we all can be divided by anything not just religion. Are you going to use someone's religion as a way to scapegoat and discriminate against someone as an individual just because of their religion? 

Learning and Science is important and crucial to humanity as a whole but so are moral, ethics, and basic human decency... how can this be learned if not by example. Judge someone as an individual by getting to know them & not just making blanket assumptions based on something so superficial as what religion an individual chooses to believe in. 

Maybe open your own mind and try considering life from another perspective. What if peoples' rights to believe & worship as they choose is taken away for absolutely everyone one day... and science and logic are the only options. In World War 2 the Nazis did this. Now, I.S.S.L  is also trying this as well. 

Do the phrases ""Never Again"" and ""Those who don't learn from the mistakes of history are bound to repeat those same mistakes"" are either ones you've heard before? This is not helpful. The zeal of atheism adds, in the eyes of the religious, yet another religious perspective...namely that there is no religion. 

Yes, world conflict can be caused by religion. But banishing it all together isn't going to solve anything.

In the secularized West, politics took the place of religion and we can see the effects of that in America. 

Religion or not, there will always be human conflict. It is the nature of our condition. Might I suggest sir. Why I am an atheist by Bhagat Singh. I'm guessing you dont like the pope huh? Religions are cults with a lot of money Nah it's not religion that causes problems, it's people's fucked up agendas and desires that get in the way Man, what did Buddhism do to deserve its spot on your shit list? the problem is people people will always be shitty in an area you find them in Lord Almighty, as I pray today for those that do not know Jesus I ask that You can break whatever it is that has control over their heart that takes them away from knowing You. Psalm 119:67 says, “Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey your word.” It is true that many have to fall to their lowest points in life before they turn their life over to You. It often takes painful circumstances to drive us to Christ. Addiction, lust, materialism, and other deadly sins are false gods that are stealing the hearts of those who need You the most. I pray for those who are unsaved that You will be able to rip the bondage of what is holding them back. May they seek You! Amen. As people do we not also have the same right to believe in whatever we want, I am an atheist but I have nothing against religion only what most people believe religion entails... being religious does not mean that you have to go to church or spread your religion it is simply to have faith in something, this something does not have to be a god, it can also be an ideal. You should  be less concerned with believing religion is crap and more concerned with what *you* believe in, what *you* put you’re faith in. There is no need to separate yourself by what or who you are, what makes us who we are is our beliefs. do not separate yourself from everyone else because of this, that is what is wrong with the idea of religion in its current state. That does not mean, however, that believing in something is inconsequential, it could never be more the opposite. Amen to that. Reddit moment To believe in any religion in any capacity you have to actually be stupid. If there’s an afterlife we are in a simulation I believe its misinterpretation of religion/ religious texts, false beliefs and narrow mindset of people that causes unrest, rather than religion. 
The broad teachings of most religions uplift the moral values and teach people to live a peaceful life. Fuck you for flipping off my religion! Do you feel better now that you're done having a humiliating temper tantrum? My personal opinion: It is not a religion's fault that there is unrest in many religious countries. It is the fault of the people. They take extreme measures and start making up new rules that serve their goals in the name of the religion. A religion's purpose is to guide people through life and to it easier, but corrupted people have changed that concept. Thus, people will start hating their religion because its idea has been deformed. Nice Reddit moment Wow you’re so enlightened! And edgy too! Preach man You're beating a dead horse here dude. This should be on r/notliketheothergirls Yep yep yep Quit shitting in the streets. AMEN! Agree with the first paragraph, religion is retarded. But it's very possible there is an afterlife. Fuck all of India What drives people to act like this? We understand, you think sky man is bad, but you don’t have to be a complete asshole religion was meant to be proxy for law and order - however a lot of people were too soft in the head to make up their own minds about right and wrong and stuck to the teats of drug-addled story tellers. Then we gave these idiots the right to vote and the invitation to fuck up everything we worked so hard to create-medical aids,education, law and order. I don't think blaming the majority party playing on religious lines is of any use. These hate-filled people are our neighbors,colleagues and acquaintances and currently are ravishing every moment of delhi burning-it warms their heart . If you want to be of any use, remember till the very end who these people are and why they don't deserve an inch of space next to a human. See the contrast. Earth's most intelligent species- Humans creating all sorts of crazy stuff with science.
Also, humans believing their god created everything with some superpowers and that god can punish you and end your problems. Fuck you all, you stupid shits! Believe what you want but don't kill people if they disagree with you and don't brainwash people to join your beliefs. I agree with the reactionary sentiment but religion wasn't another hocus pocus idea coined out of nowhere by a selected group of evil people. Religion and God as a concept grew organically as we evolved, and anything that grows out of human nature and necessity isn't something to be discarded without second thought. Of course any high school student with a functioning brain can tell that most religious concepts are fictional and outright bullshit. But because something is not real doesn't make it invalid and irrelevant. Human nature like that of any animal on earth is filled with hate, violence and raw evil as abundantly as the good side of humanity. We are capable of things far far worse than what we are led to believe in this overly protected and privileged life that we lead. Without any rules for morality or shackling our need to present our shadow to the world, we would have destroyed ourselves long ago. Religion just happened to be the best model we have for working at this. Even as of now we haven't found any sustainable alternatives and most literature, from Jung to modern day psychologists, agrees with this. Yes it sucks that people believe in fairy tales and kill each other to defend their stories, but for now our civilization isn't grown enough to handle no religion on a global scale. As an atheist it makes me extremely sad but that's the way things are. As for the bright side of things, some stuff off top of my head. For now we can try distancing state and religion as much as we can, and elect law makers who support making policies for this cause. We can also try bettering our education system to develop empathy in children as they grow up. May be for starters not elect someone who's entire agenda was divisional politics from the beginning. We can work on initiatives in raising awareness and communal harmony. List goes on. > Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.
You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.
But, you are here in the now

Thats probably one of the best descriptions of BUDDHISM I've ever read :D Has anyone sat back and thought.
""Hey maybe because of the fact I'm so incredibly small in this vast infinite universe, maybe just maybe I have no fucking clue of the forces that exist beyond us and the grand scheme of things. People just because your a spec of sand in this universe doesn't mean you don't matter. It just means you can't possibly hope to grasp the gravity of events that are going on at least in this lifetime And with that fuck capitalism and the state too! Bravo. Couldn’t have said it better myself. I cannot fathom how people believe in religion or a god. I really hopes this opens more people eyes. Funny how you sound exactly like a crazy religious zealot but with the opposite message Thank God I’m atheist!! Amen :( Atheism is a Religion. It's ok. It's the time of shadows now. No need to shout it from the rooftops. yikes🟩 I'm praying for you, OP. It's said that those with a seared conscious will never fully understand the concept of God the same way others with a strong faith can. The Holy Spirit is within you, OP. You just have to keep searching and the answers will be revealed. But you dont know what happens after death so ur just saying ur rather agressive opinion No gods, no masters. What about sikhi Personally, I've come to hypothesize that religion was born to quench man's greed to take control over others and their wealth by invoking the fear of the *unknown*. In fact, the concept of a ""God"" itself seems to be a rather genius invention which allowed someone in the very early days to control other people and to set them do their deeds—a few good and *mostly* to crush their opposition. At some point soon after, more people wanted this power over the populace and started their own groups with their own gods and thus, religions were born.

It's my personal belief that one can unlock their true potentials by freeing themselves of the ridicules imposed by their religions and gods and work for the greater good of humanity. But I would also be at peace with people following their beliefs if it didn't lead to abhorrent violence like the one we're witnessing right now.

We don't stand to gain anything by repeating the mistakes of our ancestors and murdering each other. We only stand to gain by working towards the future collectively. Religion is a necessary part of humanity. It is something that brings out the best in some people, and the worst in others, but religion gives people purpose and meaning because it is hard to understand that one day you will just black out of existance. Atheist until the plane crashes Rick Sanchez is tired of your bullshit guys. Pakistani atheist here and WHOLE HEARTEDLY FUCKING AGREE I mostly agree with you. But the tone I am reading is making it sound like a religion lol. 
Fuck religion. But I don't think we should believe on humanity either. We all are stupid and one day we will all die because of our idiocy. Agreed. And we have alcoholics because of jesus/church. (Church made it ok to drink /get drunk). What baffles me is that we still have churches. That people still believe this BS.  How many versions of the bible are there.  How drunk was the guy writing it. The last people on earth to become atheist will be Jews.

Which is why they promote it to everyone else You have quite alot of time to write this popular opinion. Well, that's your belief. Praise jesus Religion was legit just invented by someone who wanted control How is something this close minded so highly upvoted? Yikes I believe that every person can believe what they want, just don't be forcing your views on others. That also goes the other way. don't like religion, no need to announce it, you're opinion isn't an airline flight. Dick. RELIGION POISONS EVERYTHING!!! 🤨 Tbh anybody that thinks they're so certain about what happens after death is just as naive as everyone else claiming they understand this shit. There is literally no proof for either side that there is something or that there is nothing after death, it's all man made speculation. Being a hardcore atheist is no different than being devout to any other faith because you're claiming to know and understand something you very much dont. Until we die, none of us are going to grasp death in a true sense, and any living person that thinks they ""know"" is just as arrogant as the next, regardless of what they claim is out there. Accept that none of us know a fucking thing about death other than the physical process and move on You are almost there... I still choose to follow my religion, but I respect your opinion. To me it's just so empty to live for nothing in the future... to have the present unfulfilling reality and after that, nothing. 

I fully believe in Christianity... But even for those who don't, isn't there something to be said for having hope in something? Especially for all those people who have nothing to live for? Religion gives us value. 

In Christianity specifically, we believe in a God who cares deeply for us and has given us a future after death. Our lives mean something and we have a purpose now, and that carries on after death. To just get rid of that would leave life so empty. 

Sure, we can spend our time making our lives better. Helping others, bettering our lives and the lives of our families. But if that's it, what's the point? 
It just seems like a shallow, empty way to live... I'm not religious, but I wish I was. I understand why people are religious, it gives purpose to their lives, and I have none. Still some people try to play No True Scotsman, but seriously, that changes absolutely nothing. If it's prone to get violent and has gotten violent multiple times then that also *is*  a potential part of its ""nature"". Better reduce it's radius to just personal preferences. 

And I don't understand why they see you as moral-less degenerate like a dark moist mossy corner untouched by light if they hear you're an atheist. Like, wth is even moral? If you need a book, teachings, blind belief, and a supposed sky daddy just to be nice to others (which you absolutely don't either and rather find a way to justify your wrongdoings) then I can claim myself to be more self dependant than you ever will be. Man should be owned by his own thinking, not enslaved by what he's made entitled to believe. End of story. This nigga really out here believing the only uncreated creation is humans and space dust and nothing came before them. Problem are the ""Hindu atheists"" who are liberal but conflicted and play both sides. They indirectly enable these fascists. 

And Hinduism==Hindutva. Religion did not come first, Politics did. Ganesha was a satanic deity in the purana but his followers gained political power and made him benevolent. Whoever wrote Puranas obviously hated those followers and made their god satanic. It was only the pan-Indian empires who needed secularism(smhartists) who wrote differently but most kingdoms were monotheistic(Shiavist, Vaishnavist etc.), as far apart as Sunni and Shia. Nothing like what it is today.

Think about it, who would name their son Duryodhan(originally Suryodan). That's like naming someone Alakshmi. Whichever dynasty Mahabharat is based on obviously demonised them. Victors have been making the ""truth"" forever. Hinduism is not a religion. It's a way of living. I agree on the bit about religion but you couldn’t be more wrong when it comes to the history of mankind and you shouldn’t portray like you do. I just read all that thinking the person typing it was in rage, screaming with a red face. Which he/she probably was lol TLDR 🥱 What an angry little child. I mean... you could just believe and follow a religion and not be a radical... The super atheist Bullshit, I just saw God on Supernatural yesterday.  Likes to be called Chuck. Well said! Brother!!!! very classy reddit Fuck you too lmao. Nobody gives a shit for your nihilism. Also is you think religion is inherently evil you're an idiot PREACH! stop crying 🤡 Belief is good when it's pure. It's bad now because violence apologists use religion as their sword. Religion bad please upvote I see your point but you are one angry person. Relax and let people live. People will come around on their own terms if they so choose. So little words, so many lies It’s funny how ignorant some people are Propaghandi Wow you couldn't be farther from the truth. Christianity has all those answers yet you choose not to consider them because of your lusts (this is not just referring to sexual lusts.) Take some time to actually study Christianity. I know you won't because you don't want there to be a God that can judge you. You want to do what you want thinking that will improve your life. If you only knew and saw the actual movement of God now a days you'd be surprised and then afraid of your eternal pathway you'll be on after death. Agzina saglik kardes It’s a scam to get you to waste your very real time on this earth for a promise of more time that doesn’t come. Just enjoy the time you have here and now, it’s finite. AGREE 100% “You do not matter... but matter itself is being part of this universe.”

That’s an oxymoron. You just said it. Under your worldview, we do not matter. In fact, under your worldview you can not tell me why murder is wrong, rape, etc. Because we are cells together to form consciousness. 

Your worldview is incoherent. Your worldview leads to nihilism and death. Your worldview is the childish one, sounding Incredibly arrogant and edgy. Your worldview is incompatible with reason itself. You cannot even use rationale without borrowing from the religious, because the laws of logic themselves are immaterial.

Grow up, learn that the world isn’t black and white and that every human is capable of great evil and is indeed evil, whether religious or atheist. Stop blaming others (religion) for your problems. Man up. Try to do good. And stop following a contradictory worldview that says life has purpose because it has no purpose. Euh atheist movements caused massive exterminations, think Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, wtf this is so stupid. What if I chose to believe in what I want. You chose to believe in or have a lack of belief in what you want. We respect each other’s decision and move on? I think the problem in India is not your religion. It's india Speaking of childish, this rant.  Are you 14 and this is deep?  Religion is the reason we know how to read, how do you know what happens after death?  Have you died?  The catholic church has massive amounts of hospitals and medical care.  So you believe that nothing became something for no reason?  How can you say what is good and evil?  Isnt is all relative if there is no transcendent truth?  Faith in a God of truth and lawfulness is the source of science.  This post seems like the temper tantrum of a small child. I mean, you kind of just explained Buddhism honestly I think religion does have its purposes. It’s gives people hope, teaches good morals, and attempts to scare those people into following those morals. Most of those morals are good, but it also backfires with a lot of hate like you said. Such as Christians and their hatred for lgbt etc. Those words are exactly what I think of humans and religion. each and every word! Oh look another atheist that just has to tell people he’s an atheist. You guys do more spreading your word than all religions combined. Fuckin’ amen!!! Dude chill.... Lol. sorry but low IQ people need some kind of behavioral philosophy to follow or they'll all rage against their existence. I am not particularly religious. I enjoy some of the stories and agree religion causes a lot of damage but it can be helpful to some e.g the lonley. Being part of a community is good. It sounds a bit like you think war etc would end if religion did but I dont think it wouldb there would still be greed etc. You dont really know what happens after death so you can't really expect people to accept your beliefs over thiers. This came out of nowhere Your post indicates that you don’t have a true understanding of Buddhism, and because of that I have to believe that you most likely have a misunderstanding of all religions. To me it seems like your post is one led by emotion rather than of fact. So with all this open mindedness and being insignificant. Why would leaving religion  behind matter? Seems like you put a lot of effort into what is ultimately meaningless.

Also, the 20th century when God was proclaimed dead has been the bloodiest century more so than the past 19 combined. Thanks for that.

You say religion divides. And well I don't disagree with that. The major factors for war have always been greed, power and lust. 

Shalom shalom. God bless. Seems strange to not believe in religion but to be certain that nothing happens after you die.

I understand the absolute disbelief of man made religions but it seems just as arrogant to say that you are certain nothing happens after death as it does to say X or Y god is real. Don’t forget Judaism Fuck all atheism

Atheism is stupid and fucking useless. This is because I say so. Leave your atheistic beliefs. The Chinese are atheist and kill millions, you are a murderer as well.


- sounds pretty fucking retarded when you think with your brain Has this person not heard of communism. That alone has caused just about 100 million deaths in less than 100 years. Thank Stalin and mao for that. Very anti religious people. Before religion there was the ""eye for an eye"" and even before that, if you harmed someone, they were entitled to murder your entire family. Religion shows one way to deal with human urges instead of pouring them into the world. Wa wa cry Jeez, what's worse? A religious figure shoving scriptures down an atheist's throat or an athiest griping at a religious figure about the religion they worship? Why cant people just let others believe/not believe what they want? This post is honestly pretty toxic, I dont know why people cant just do what they want as long as it doesn't harm others Go back to tumblr No doubt religion has been used for violent wars and mass control of the masses but that doesn’t mean religion is inherently evil, only that people have manipulated it for their own selfish ends. TEEHEE at leaST YOU LoVe ThE jEWs. OP said Fuck Islam. Good bye OP. It was nice to read your last post. no On this same topic how about religions that don’t have a defining deity? I have quite a few buddhist friends and Wiccan friends who sure, “believe in fairy tales” according to me and a lot of other people around me, but they are some of the nicest folks I know and none of them pledge to any gods, sure Buddha is a figure head, but I haven’t my found a single person who worships Buddha, only the occasional person who follows the path of the Buddha, and only one of the wiccans I know actually “worships” the moon, the other two just hold a hefty respect for nature. What are some opinions on that line of thought?

Not trying to say these religions haven’t caused violence because any belief, hell fuck that, any difference that any human has ever had with another human has caused bloodshed at some point, but I have always found these religions more interesting to talk about then typical “I give my life and soul to god” religions. Full disclosure: I'm currently a Christian, but I have serious doubts about my faith. I appreciate the skepticism of your post, but there are some things I disagree with.

>You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.

So what? Even if people are only religious because they're scared of death, this wouldn't make religion false. 

>Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe. What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.

Why do you support ""faith in people"", but not religious faith? Isn't faith the very thing you are trying to eradicate? If you're against believing things without evidence, then both kinds of faith should be wrong. Also, your claim that we control our destiny seems incompatible with materialism(I assume you don't believe in souls), as then we would be subject to physical laws.

>Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

I disagree with your second sentence there. Many of the great scientists of the past were religious. George Lemaitre, who developed the Big Bang theory, was a Catholic priest. The monk Gregor Mendel's work on heredity is crucial for our modern understanding of evolution. Those are just two examples. However, I'll be the first to admit that religion and science haven't always been harmonious, but I don't think they're entirely incompatible either. 

Additionally, why do you think ""nothing divides us except religion""? Unless you're defining religion super broadly, I'm unconvinced of this. In my experience, politics is just as, if not more, divisive. Also, religion can unite people by giving them a common purpose and meaning.

I sincerely don't mean to downplay the religious violence going on in India. It is absolutely terrible and there is no justifying it. However, I would challenge the idea that religion itself is entirely to blame. If religion were to be wiped off the earth tomorrow, I doubt that evil people would go away, and the regimes of Stalin and Pol Pot are evidence of this. The real problem, in my view, is ideological extremism and the gullibility of people to go along with it. These problems can occur whether religion exists or not.

One final point: Throughout your post you say that humans have an obligation to make the world better. My question is: What is the evidence that this obligation exists, and why should anyone follow it? I'm not a moral relativist, but I have been struggling lately with justifying my own belief in objective moral values. 👀 Damn who hurt you bro I know no one will read it, but anyway.
Author, you are super childish and maximalist. I had same ideas about religion when I was 18, but now I actually understand, how stupid I was back then. Yes, blind faith and all the violence, to which some religions and some people, acting religious, lead, is a bad part.
But religion also helps people to cope, for example with a loss of loved ones. Religion helps people to unite together in a community and help each other. Religion is set to promote kindness and prevent violence. Religion helps to achieve an inner peace and solve an existential crisis for some people.
Religion (and discussing particular ones) is a hard topic but your outlook on it, as I already said, is absolutely childish and wrong, only looking at one part of it. This is the most reddit post ive seen in months Agree Hey man I’m atheist as well but you really are mad, (I didn’t read through the whole thing so if there is a personal reason sry) OP is a pompous douche bag. >Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion.

Prove its made up. Im not defending religion, but you do not know either way, or apparently have the ability to critically think. What was the point of this anyways? Looking for validation? Someone piss you off? 

You'll get over it. After taking enough fungi and such, religion is trying to describe an essence that it can't be spoken about really, and it isn't a power held above you as Christianity may describe a god as. What it tries to describe is really just the whole picture and each living thing from a microbe to a giant whale is apart of this whole. There is benefit to spiritualism I think, and for each person that path can be different or even non existent. It's just always better, I find, to keep it to yourself and not involve other people. Science has proved that there has to be a creator. You seem to have a lot of hate built up inside you. Stay positive. By saying fuck all religion you are just spreading hate as an atheist. War is inevitable with or without religion. [George Carlin’s take on this](https://youtu.be/8r-e2NDSTuE) This is the best post I have ever read!  Finally a sensible person speaking sensibly. Agreed in every way! Religion ruins us. Can someone explain? Sorry I’m out of the loop a few of your arguments do make sense at a microscopic level..but look

let people do whatever the fuck they want to do

however if you still insist on digging your nose in these matters, god as a concept rather than a rightful entity could be encouraged instead of going all the way and proposing atheism

also, religion to some is a source of reason/purpose so don't tread on it I would rather choose to believe and in the end be wrong, than live a life believing in nothing and in the end be right.  You are entitled to your opinion, just as anyone else, and I completely support that. But for you to say that what we believe in is ""wrong"" when you have absolutely no proof that there is no higher power, is the same as me saying that you are wrong because there is a higher power. There is no proof either way, that's why they call it faith.  I have friends of all walks of life, hindu, christian, muslim, atheist, and so-forth. None are wrong and none are right. Atheist governments commit mass killings as well. [Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes)  genocide isn’t exclusive to religion, in fact countless people throughout history (and modern day) have been and continue to be killed for simply having a religion. [cheers](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O35Dxb_V2Sc) Maybe if you had some religion you wouldn’t be such an angry bitter person with a potty mouth. Religion is just a tool used by the powerful to stay in power. If it wasn't for religion, it would be immigration, social status, education literally anything.

The problem isn't religion. The problem is the us vs them mentality. Religion is just the means to end. I am always surprised at the Indians inability to work together. Ethnically you are the same. THe english came raped your nation and your people. They left you divided because the wanted to return as your masters. That did not happen, but The west is till your master. You all bleed the same. You are all Indian. Become the power you are meant to be abandon religion and bath in the blood of people like modhi who would promote it. join $DCLT! When you have nothing, religion sounds pretty good. Organized religion is mostly shit.

But that doesn't mean god isnt real. The New Testament is hostile to religion. Yeah, but get rid of the cast system first. Haha OP didn't point Jainism, Sikhism in his post, Jainism and Sikhism are the best religions!! /s Okay but if our existence is indeed pointless, why do scientists then proceed to do all they can to unlock the secrets to the universe and our planet, and to rationalise everything? Simply put, they fear the idea of being a tiny speck in the grand scheme, the same is said for the general public, and of the general public; religious people. Everyone has there own way of coping with insignificance, some people even like to be assholes, and take a lot minutes and even hours out of their miniscule time of existence to do just that, those people are you. If you can't respect other people's decisions and choices, how do you expect your own to be respected in return? Should people even take your opinion seriously if you continue like this? Remember that respecting someone's opinion is different to agreeing with it, if you disagree with their opinion, it doesn't meant you have to disrespect them. Just let people be, instead of creating a negative and depressing energy for everyone around you. After all, your existence is pointless and you can't do anything significant to change how the universe works, so why not just live out that existence in peace and happiness? Honestly I think religion is just a tool, like knife or gun and stuff. It will be just replaced to something else if we somehow erase it completely.

I really do understand religion's doing more bad than good nowadays, (our country's Coronavirus infectee's almost tripled thanks to one trashy believer) maybe it's just human nature to have conflict and discriminate. Obviously I do not think both are good, but seeing the world made me think that way. You just started another one! Well, that's just, like, your opinion, man...

The Big Lebowski The Way I see religion is it’s a way to follow life even if it means nothing in the end it’s part of our species at this point and I think it’s just nice to follow somthing in life kinda like a government you specifically address supernatural religions in this rant / well-put point. what about naturalistic religions? Modern Satanism for example  \- Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 

I am actually really looking forward to the opportunity to be part of a supernova. Seriously though look at the Catholic church and the Vatican i keep reading reports about these sick fucks molesting children and they think once they die THEY are going to heaven? HAHAHA The pope is such a farce get fucked you sick child molesting ass clowns.
#FUCKALLRELIGION I mean I don’t believe in any religion either, but the people who do aren’t hurting anybody by believing in something more, and it makes them feel better. Atheism is a religion just like other religions. Religion poisons everything You sure do have a strong distaste for something you don't believe in. Interesting. Tell me more about how or what I should believe. Thanks. I discovered this when I was 8. Fuck you too :). If heaven exists, a Muslim might go to heaven. A Christian might go to heaven. A jew might go to heaven. But a Atheist is forever in the grave r/atheism is leaking This sounds like the “talk” every religion has right before trying out that mass murder thing you speak of. Maybe human nature is more to blame join a group>become fanatical>fuck shit up. It’s the rinse and repeat of mankind acting super special cause you have the answer. Not wanting to start anything just know that one search and word replace and you become the people you’re bitching about. The biggest problem with religion has always been the people. They try to twist the words to fit their world view and when they need to do that it is never about their god anymore. Let us blame everything on religion, and absolutely not on humans lust, greed, wrath, envy, pride, gluttony and avarice. Sure it is easy for you to hate on religion when you feel abandoned by the entity that we call god. 

Do you really believe that we advanced in technology because we ""worked together"" or is it who can dominate who first? 

Humans are a spectrum that goes from evil to good and people are spread out in that spectrum, and very few people are really fking pure and are good but alot of people are fking evil. We manipulate, we decieve, we conspire and we kill for our gain. Religion is a trend that nations use to motivate if there was no religion there would be something else to motivate people to kill and rape. Don't put it on religion because you are so fking arrogant and ignorant to your leaders and humanity.  

You say religion is a fairy tail but what you are talking about is the biggest fairytail there is, people working together, holding hands and dancing to we are the world. Sit your fking ass down you clown. Let me ask you this how the fk do you know that there is nothing after death, the very argument you use to ""put religius people in place"" is a two edged sword, how the fk do you know that there is nothing after death? 

Let people believe what they want to believe, jesus we have people that thing there are billions of genders, and media is fking supporting them and condemming religion. You are a puppet my friend we all are so stop acting like you know whos behind the scene nobody knows in the end we all will die and by then will figure out whos right and whos wrong, id rather be religius and die if there is something after death il be doing fine and if there is nothing il be fine too, but guess if there is something after death and it is one of those religius beliefs that is ""right"" and you are an athiest who shittalked people for being religius guess where you are going my friend... hell or being reincarneted as you again you cunt. Christians in America especially. I love to read about ancient history and one thing I've learned is that most Christians don't have a clue how the bible was written or how it was rewritten. I highly suggest Misquoting Jesus if anyone wants a deep dive. Most Christians just blindly follow and believe whatever they are told, and that imo is a cult lead by false prophets. Christians are such ignorant children. I agree.
But i think when christianity first got invented it might have had some actually good things to say.
The sad thing is emperors used religion to control people rewriting the bible while doing so.
And now it's full of random stuff that is only there because it was useful to some person in a high position. Chill bhai What you are all referring to is organised religion. Organised religion is a huge cause of death and unrestbut normal religion is fine. Chill. Not to seem like that guy, but our sun will not go supernova, rather it will expand as a red giant and then shrink to a white dwarf where it will remain dominant with the earth added to it. Also you cant just rudely tell people to abandon religion and expect them to listen.

Edit- I am a retard and cannot spell Yea same Religion can be a source of evil, but most of the values they teach give guidence and hope to people to live good lives, I believe that many people have realized religion is bullshit and any creation story for fables are made up. But the message they teach can help those in their darkest hour

You never hear about people leading good lives from religion but only the horrors of greed and power hungry corrupt members. To smear the brush wide you forget the benefits that these organizations create too. So personally, fucking them all isn't a fair assessment of the situation to be honest Religion is opium for the masses. I can joke about Jesus without fear of being killed. Lol at people arguing over which country is the least worst. If anyone here thinks religion is worthless or that we are better off without it, you haven’t engaged with religion on a serious, academic level, which means you don’t understand a crucial aspect of humanity. You don’t understand human culture. Every religion offers vital insights into the collective unconscious of human cultures. Highly recommend reading Nietzsche’s “Thus Spoke Zarathustra” or honestly any work by Carl Jung. Wanting to get rid of religion is like throwing the baby out with the bath water. How many wars do not have their roots in religion?  A retired general once told me he had studied it during his time in the forces and he couldn't find any.  Is this true? Damn son, who hurt you? Big mood [deleted] A fitting song

[Propagandhi - Haille Sellasse, Up Your Ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPpXY1aWKgI) I think it was Jaggi Vasudev who said something along the line of “to believe in god is ignorance, to not believe in god is ignorance “ in relation to observation perception and fundamental human growth. Basically stay in our own lane but don’t act haughty. While what they believe in may be fiction, they still believe in it. Even if you want to believe otherwise, religion has a very prominent impact on our society, and we have to understand and accept that. To say “fuck Religion” on Reddit isn’t exactly a means to an end. ""I think it's a waste of time"" cool, and you're allowed to, just like I'm allowed to be a christian. Stop going out of your way to shit on things that bring people peace just because you're bitter and unhappy Would be cool if people cited their rants more often. The Middle East is living proof that Religion is cancer. Especially when it takes control of the government. Go owfff Wow this started a whole war in the comments 😂 Probably not* the best way to start that claim. Preach it brother! Not takings sides here but let’s call any religion what it truly is ... an organized belief system.  Since we live in a world where things create other things, there must be something (aka God, Buddha, Allah etc?) to help explain the creation of man in order to convince, control, and organize the vulnerable believers. More people have been killed on this earth over religion than any other means ... we need to stop the madness!!!! I haven’t read all this. But about 2 years ago I felt exactly the same way. I absolutely DESPISED religion with a burning passion as well as 99% of the people who believe in it.

I’m not a practicing religious person by any means, but I know now there is more out there, outside of what we can touch. I had a spiritual awakening similar to when people take DMT but I didn’t take any drugs and it lasted about 6 months before I realised what was going on. Thought I was going insane at first. Either way, calm down lol. You’re showing your age. We ourselves are more to blame rather than ""religion"".
Fuck all of us! The reason that I am not an atheist, is because it is entirely unhelpful. I gain nothing from it whereas from christianity I gain happiness and companionship. 
Another way I have always looked at it is:

Atheism:
                Best case scenario: nothing |
                Worst case scenario: hell

Religion:
               best case scenario: heaven |
               Worst case scenario: nothing

Edit: formatting Let me change ""Fuck all Religion"" to ""Fuck all conservative religion"". If your religion makes you close your mind then yes fuck your religion. Fuck India and all the awful assholes that answer phones for American companies there... I know the negative impact of the religious sentiments but its not all bad, it does give a answer to questions like why is it wrong to commit suicide or murder. While undoubtedly everyone should form their own belief system instead of believing in anyone but i think we are quite far away from there, cause if you reject religion that can descend into nihilism and that is not exactly a good belief system if your life is going downhill, that is basically like flirting with suicide, so i the bleakest of moment religion can be a ray of light and its all empowering when it concern only the individual but lets be honest here religion always end up becoming institutionalized. My reply: (deep breath) I know it's funny to be an edgy 13 year old that trashed on religion and then point out others are meaningless since you know you're life is meaningless but here's a fact. The biggest removal of religion in the USSR killed hundreds of times more than religion did in history. Ugh fuck off shit dude, let people live their lives. i’m not even religious but chill 🤣 Penis. South park is !y religion Here’s the big problem with what you are saying. We all don’t know for sure if God or gods are real. But a lot of people choose to believe because there sad and depressed and need love. So think about what your gonna say before you say it. Also scientists still have not found concrete proof that we evolved from something in the water. And there is the fact they can’t replicate fossilization. Look it up!!! I believe in God, not religion. Genuinely asking but why do a lot of you hate religion? Saying that their is no greater Being or after life eventually leads to nihilism. If we're just a speck in space and in the end I get nothing and the world just implodes, why not kill myself and everyone else off? Why even live? It doesn't matter in the end does it?

I'm not a religious fanatic myself, but their is value in religion and it's teachings. Morals eventually derive from some form of religion. Just because there was bad done by people claiming to be religious, doesn't mean all religion is bad does it?

Science has created the atomic bomb. Science has led to guns and mustard gas. But not all science is bad is it? Science has made medical advancements and has  increased life expectancy.

Religion has given a lot of people a sense of direction and morality. I gurantee there are more Christian's helping those starving in Africa than atheists. Gurantee it.

I hope all of you understand where I'm coming from and I understand where a lot of you are coming from. There have been a lot of religious assholes. But it has also help guide us in terms of science and morality. It's not all bad. You can choose what to believe but don't shit on all religion because it had some bad eggs. 

Best to all of you! 

The problem doesn't lie in religion itself but the institutionalization happed after they were formed. I am a Hindu and I like to read different school of thoughts in  sanatan dharma. The main problem of today's religion and their followers is they have very institutionalized thought processes. India is the land of seekers. We have embraced atheism long before it was ""Cool"". You can look for Charvaka school of philosophy which is basically seeking truth in the form of materialism and atheism. I partly agree that religion is root cause of major problems in world today but that is not because of religion it self but what humans did with it. We pitted each religion against each other to justify our war mongering nature. If you closely observe historical timeline you'll observe that majority of wars that were fought on basis of religion, were in times when there were very few advances in philosophies of each religion. Religion is meant to serve personal values but unfortunately we humans have used it to justify our actions. 

For the fellow atheists here, I respect your choice of atheism. But we are the part devil of this world as well. And lastly why don't we blame Science for creation of nuclear weapons which can annihilate world in matter of minutes? We can't, cause we know that it's devil that we created ourselves out of nuclear science just like we did with religion and created intolerance, terrorism etc. Science and religion are two very powerful philosophies but their right use depends on us. Lmao ok boomer There's a difference. I do have some faith that there is a God, I just don't believe in religion. Religion is run like a business... For someone who hates religion you sure do talk about it a lot ha ha. Honestly you just sound angry, and hurt. HOLLA! yea religion is not the reason people kill and hate eachother. Its a human nature. Lots of animals kill eachother as well,even their own species and they are not religious as far as I know Boedhism ain't a religion per se. This post is wildly hateful. Tread carefully India. I say we just exterminate the human race. Please donate to my cause You left out Judaism.  Slicing baby's dicks apart is the ultimate violation of human rights. To say something came from nothing is insanity. Are you insane? The desperation in trying to push your own beliefs on others suggest you are. Bro just live your life. When you die you will know for sure what is on the other side. Leave me out of it. I will can contest you on your claim that we evolved. Okay doomer The tipping is strong with this one. Religion is like a teddy bear. It was useful for our species in our infancy, when our ignorance needed some psychological crutch to calm us down in this scary universe. However, as we are about to enter our adult phase, it's past time we leave our psychological-comfort teddy bears behind. I think Indian societal norms are from that of the Stone Age. There’s hundreds of sexual assault cases there that don’t even get heard. Child abuse does not even faze the Indian public nor apparently does child trafficking nor child marriages. You try to make a fair argument, but the basic idea of religion is the shared belief on being moral.

It may sound like stating the obvious but there is a difference with being moral and in believing it.

To some it may be a small difference to others not.

(For example filtering the world in our conscience to have a good inner voice. What ever we think, we try to think in a certain positive way. 

Rather than not necessarily believing, and just see how we feel about the situation. How we process the world is Thus different. The filter is of our own making and random.

And it might affect a person in the sense they feel less empathy or care less especially when no one is watching.

They might forget to process things in a certain way, and their language might also change and their emotions as a result as well.)

But also to make things more obscure we are dealing with a world that is religious, so how can you say that people not believing in being good is going to make them better especially when no one is watching?

We are also dealing with a lot of benefits and welfare, what will happen to the morality of people in a moment of crisis if they don’t have the custom of believing in being good?

I can understand The want to make the world a better place, but freedom of religion is the best to hope for. Trying to change the dynamics too much is another uncertainty.

For example can you guarantee security and wealth so people are not dealing with circumstances that may be ‘believing’ morality will have more benefits than not (presumably).

I think if people want to make the world a better place it comes from those things in improving people’s lives. That is with technology. And I think we don’t quite have that level of technology to quite easily say that abandoning a belief system will be better. Since even being just moral, implies some kind of belief in a constitution to make it work in tough times, when no one is watching. For example almost every country is dealing with a significant amount of corruption, will them having less faith, or not having to pretend to be ‘faithful’ have more positive effects on corruption or not?

Ona global scale religion is different than before. The conversation regarding religion in public generally involves people being and ‘acting’ good. At least they have to ‘act’ good which is still important imo. There is a net benefit not just how it translate to a certain culture of caring, or good action but also the psychological impact it can have to be an inclusive society rather than one that is more capitalistic and is a dog eat dogs world.

I think by rejecting the belief in being good, rather than just common sense or common interests Of being good, can quickly shift human behavior to be more unhealthy. We can also look at humans being savage without laws and instructions. Their natural state is quite barbaric, which is why the point of technology and being a utopia is important. The barbaric humans of the past did not have a belief system and even if they did, their lives were too extreme to have a use for it. It took humans a long time to reach this level of society and religion was their crutch for good or bad. Which is why it is a big uncertainty due to their basic nature and their dependence on religion, to say wether they would be good without religion.

Just like philosophers of the past have studied human behavior and some will say humans need to be taught to be good to be good. ""Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing""

Same statement as believing in God, the fuck you know about post-death, how the fuck you can prove it. Religion isn’t meant to be a collection of stories, but an easier interpretation of complex morals and values.  Hinduism, specifically, is not a religion as Western Philosophy has deemed, but more so a lifestyle, a way of living.  It truly is a beautiful conception of our reality, in which each god is a symbol for humanly needs (Lakshmi for wealth, Hanuman for strength, Ganesha for perseverance, etc). And in turn, we use prayer to each God as a way to ease the mind and focus on one entity.  Hinduism says that we are all one, and oneness is derived from ultimately dissolving the ego.

Religion isn’t supposed to be a collection of fiction and stories, but a teaching of what life is.  It is a collection of teachings from many different individuals, who place these teachings in the format of stories so it is easier to understand. Disbelief in a god is also a belief itself. You cannot claim to know the universal truth when it is not possible. Thank the universe someone finally said it! Its not religion its confessions that harms humanity. You can try to think of an religion that simply believes in the power of love and set love above all other things. 
It would not harm humanity. By definition it cant harm humanity.
You get the point?
I think there was a guy called jesus. Might be he had an similar idea...
Point is the biggest utopies (e.g. Religions, communism) will always be most likely abused by people not believing in anything and harm humanity. Only a sith deals in absolutes Why you so mad ? 😟 Didn't know I was on r/cringe Op probably wouldn’t be so angry about what other people think if he found peace in religion, just saying. Lol eat a dick Religion is a crutch that was once required and helped greatly in the structure of societies, the problem is, like with anything, when it came time to move on from it, the people involved were earning too much money and garnered more respect and power than they ever could have on their own so they abused their power to stifle progress that would have made them obsolete.

 The problem now is indoctrination through repetition, and, although I understand your anger, arguments are seldom won by the person telling everyone else how stupid they are, especially when we (humanity/science) have only answered some of lifes questions and their religion offers all the answers, albeit wrong ones. Woah guys we have an edgy atheist here ok cool Religion is not a problem, people having different beliefs and values than you is not a problem. You are so blind to your hatred of people who believes differently than you to see your attitude is the problem. Your attitude is shared by people of religion about other religions, non-believers, and people who scare them because their different. Everyone wants to fit every body into their own box, instead of accepting the fact that people are going to believe how they choose to believe. I am a proud Christian and I love people, I have views that differ from the rest of the world I know that. I will never force my beliefs or views on others, but I expect the same respect from others. You have the right to feel the way you do, that’s ok, but to belittle people and a destructive and aggressive way is not the best way to address our differences. Learn to have respect for your fellow humans that believe differently than you, don’t box yourself in to a small area. Just my opinion take it for what you will /r/copypasta Religion isn't the problem it's the idiots that don't know how to follow religious values/rules. Yeah I’ll never get over how call culty organized religion is I will continue to be religious and not become a miserable prick like yourself. Enjoy your pessimistic lifestyle and tell me again about how my life beliefs make me as miserable and incorrigible as yourself! Believe what you want to believe but if it makes you this down on life I would think into other options my friend. Lol you clown Well said. Shut the fuck up. You don't know anything for a fact, just the same as a theist. Nobody knows what happens after death, nobody knows whether there's a God. Plenty of things divide us, not just religion. r/enlightenedcentrism This is so beautiful omg. 
Thanks for proving words can be breathtaking Wow so woke cause religion bad Yep all religion. Fuck your cross and for head burka shits. Amen. Fuck any God! Nah I'm good bruh r/EdgyAthiest Fuch ewe. have you died ? how do you know theres nothing after? energy never dies? oh waits its just YOUR belives. > You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter.  

This is a subjective claim, but I would argue that this is very wrong. As far as we know there is no other life in this universe except on Earth. Also, as far as we know there is no other form of life in the universe as intelligent as a human. The Earth may be a (giant to us) tiny speck floating in the vast expanse, but that expanse is speckled  with unliving and unintelligent stuff. As far as significance, the human race may be the most amazing product of the universe so far. Yarr this dude is going to HELL¡! Well that’s just like, your pinion man. Yes yes and fucking yes. Religion is the worst of all evils I'll  never understand why someone is so angry with something they dont have to be a part of  idgaf if you dont believe in what I believe in. That's your decision and I'm happy you have the right to believe what you want to believe.
Edit: typo This is bs.

1- He  stated facts that are not facts at all, like we coming from Africa 300k years ago, we dont know for sure.

2- He is against religion but then speak about we are nothing on the big schemes of things? This is actually paraphrasing many religions out there.

3- No one gives a shit about religion, wars are not made on religion, the people who creates wars, they just put a catchy name to it to force people to move but they themselves dont give two fucks about a war because of religion or resources.

3.1- Atheist also make as many wars as they please

4-Atheism is just another bs as well as religion you people are the opposite faces of the same coin. Everything u talk as well as deeply religious guys is pure trash. Dont you fucking think u are outside the bubble of human beings and think you are being objective, like that would be actually laughable.

5- Religious people as well as agnostics or atheists follow the same bs, thinking the have the reason and that they know it all. Lmao you guys give me a break. There is religion yes, but there is also a connection to the Universe that we all have. A connection that doesn’t require you to be religious. Religion has set us back so far it’s hilarious. I thought 18 was the minimum age for reddit No thanks As I was reading this post, I could only think of the Quote from ""Pale Blue Dot"" by Carl Sagan 

""  hat's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.   ""

We are nothing but mote of dust suspended in a sun beam. And here we are fighting in the name of the unknown. You can have your religions AND be loyal to your species. Don't worry about religion if you don't want a part in it. Every person is an individual autonomous person, so why are you going to spend so much time being against their decisions? Just enjoy your own way, and if these are your complaints, then be, in your character, the way  you want to see others in your world act. Just because some people are, of my personal opinion, stupid and warlike, doesn't really mean that Religion is the primary cause. Sure, religion is easy to blame, because people like to use it as a way to justify their aggression and transgressions by ""Invoking the law of the lord"" or some other mindless and willful reason.

People are afraid to change their ways of life, and religious discrimination has been the main cause of unrest in India, usually not religion in and of itself. Religion is a positive thing, you can't just stop something from existing because you hate it. How about nurturing it into something that can actually be positive and helpful to the world?

Avoiding conflict is often as simple as moving forward. When you put down your weapons and abandon your conflicts, progress happens. Happy lives can happen. Simple as that.

EDIT: After sifting through some comments, I think what OP may be expressing is the lack of an outlet for those who are not interested in religion whatsoever. And that's fine. I think that non-religious culture greatly benefits the interests of everyone. Just a matter of waiting for people to wake the fuck up. Amen brother. A-fukken-men. Interesting Post detailing you opinion. I don't want to start an debate because God knows its been done before by men/women more better versed than myself. 

As a scientist, I am left with evidence that points to the existence of an all powerful all knowing God. 

Matter and Energy Exists: Where did it come from? Another universe? Maybe but where did that come from? Our universe requires causality but what caused the first cause? Perhaps something without a cause, without beginning nor end. 

Matter and Energy Behaves in a constant manner: We know there are attractive and repulsive forces which dictate bonding and energy levels but we have no idea why this is the case. Its like a universal ""settings"" tab running the background keeping the laws that govern this universe constant. 

Also, saying F\*ck all religious doesn't make you sound too smart. cheers, ill drink to that Ummmmm ya Amen. Talk about tolerance of other beliefs eh?
One of the main reasons India will never thrive because it's people don't have tolerance so you can Hindus in charge the country will be a shithole, you can have Atheists in charge the country in charge but until you develop tolerance for other beliefs you will be stuck in the stone age. Actually religion has brought peace to me. Fuck modi and his cronies. He’s a top class chutiya. He’s the hitler of the brownies. Let’s be honest. That’s what this post should have been about. For thousands of year people have co-existed and also they had their fair share of wars. So much hatred is out there😓 I can't believe it still exists in 2020. Glad the trends say it's going away Fuck people who try to push their beliefs onto others. That includes you. Yikes. I disagree. Wait, not Jainism. Right? Sir this is a mcdonalds Fuck you Fuck you! Imagine if people got into wars over whether or not Santa was real. As an Indian, I approve of this sentiment. I will gladly vote for a politician who runs on a policy of abolishing religion from our country and from the face of this world. Any plans of running? i was born in a muslim family, same here, i think religions are nothing but some kind of culture. Let the enlightenment spread.  It is time. We are alone on a rock floating through space, we have invented everything on this planet and “gods” are for people who cannot hang with the idea of the endlessness of the universe.  It’s time to move on to space. PRAISE r/cornbible I do not belive in God or ANY religion.

BUT

You have to be an even bigger moron than the biggest religious zealot to say, WITHOUT A DOUBT, that there is nothing after death. Simply saying to yourself that there 100% cannot be anything makes you look like an idiot. Can you time travel? Can you travel to the beginning of time? No? Then stop acting like you can. Nobody knows. There is probably nothing but nobody knows except people that have died. Fanatism and lack of education go hand-in-hand. Every time I hear about religion riots in India, inevitably follows another report with lives lost. Reminds me of the ""holy wars"" of medieval Europe. Amen! y’all are so pathetic it’s sad i actually believe in a dimension where all dead people go, but i aint believing in a zombie On an unrelated note, I felt like playing DOOM 2016 after reading this. I don't think Buddhism counts here, especially Zen. While I don't agree with religion in alot of context especially when used hypocritically or to cause harm , there is alot of truth in myth , in archetypes , consciousness and practices especially in buddhism. Take rebirth for example, from a scientific standpoint if the universe created life why cant it decompose it then create a new stucture from it. Your Belief isn't going to replace certain truths and reality especially in things like consciousness. However in terms of childish belief people are more unreasonable and unreliable than any religious teachings lol. See your statement of you do not matter but matter exist is contradictory in nature, & even things like immortality isn't such a far-fetched concept as technology progresses so are we suppose to abandon science when that becomes religion and then passes into myth. I remember my fifteenth birthday too, good times. >Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christian, fuck Buddhism.  
>  
>Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.  
>  
>You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.

You just described Buddhism. Amén! Ok Better to be a non-organized spiritualist then be a member of any kinda specific religion. Your points are highly valid tho. Can't saying this kind of thing get you in trouble in your country? Ironically, in trying to stop divisions your anger and hostility may create them, people are more receptive to calm and well-argued people. 

I'm religious, the only thing i oppose in your argument is that religion is made up. That is it. Yes we die. Yes there may not be anything beyond this. Yes violence is bad. Yes religion is very divisive. Yes your legacy should be based on being good to mankind. 

You're angry, that's fine. But in the end people will always believe in religion, your anger only seeks to do the thing you don't want, make divisions. Calm down. What do you say to the people who's religion helped them become a better person? Is this a new religion? Amen. But you go to the moon before clean water and sanitation. Have fun shitting in rivers... the Roman’s had fucking sewers but India says fuck it let’s go to the moon. Because our brains create problems, I can see how religion seems like a problem. But, on the other hand, because our brains will religify just about anything, I can see how not having any at all would make them all that more difficult to trace, and therefore dangerous to battle. We all tend towards the worship and zealotry of something, the religious are just surprisingly less delusional on this point than the non-religious. All cultures have had three things in common since time immemorial 

Art

Music

Religion 

Religion is hardwired into us for some reason. Plus there are so many mysteries in this world that really can’t be explained. Look up reincarnated children on YouTube. Not that reincarnation has anything to do with religion. Religions have adopted reincarnation as a perk, however. I feel the same way about reality shows like Nach Baliye and Dance Plus. Fuck all ya'll for watching crap TV and encouraging them to make more, you're just filling your minds with pointless crap.

Boredom is good for your mental health. Saying that there is no experience after death is just as flawed as saying that there is experience after death. It is true they religion has caused many problems in the world, but you don’t know any better than anyone else does. By acting like you do, you are just as toxic as a close minded religious person. It’s funny someone can believe so wholeheartedly something so specific happened 300,000 years ago but completely dismiss something else. What u believe doesn't matter 👹👹😾😾 I hate that people are allowed to be taught religion by their parents. Especially Islam. Islam is designed only for the purpose of oppressing women, but even the women don't realize it because they're taught that it's okay essentially from birth. Lol you sound young. *grabs popcorn* If anyone commits violence in the name of religion, it's settled; they're a massive Mcfucknugget. Yo who didn't fuck their mans right Amen. ""Open your mind"" 😂. And yet they're telling people what to believe. [deleted] Atheistic Anarchism will be the real salvation of humanity. Whot is this india The main cause of strife in the world is jackasses trying to tell everybody else what to do.

  

Sit down, shut up and chill TFO. So much hate in this post. :( Darwin Award tl:dr Fuck freedom of choice, fuck culture, fuck age, fuck gender, fuck me hating cheese, fuck you hating me hating cheese, fuck ducks, fuck kids, fuck moms, fuck language,  duck you, fuck me, fuck everybody

Welcome to the divided world
By design
Not my design

It reminds me of the second renassaince, animatrix ""....and for a time, it was good..."" Just putting it out here that atheists are just as idiotic/smart as the people who believe in religion. If you want to ""Fuck"" religion, try being agnostic. You go nowhere with a closed ideology of atheism. WORD My faith makes me happy, i don't push it onto anyone, i just practise it myself. I don't see why i should leave that, your post is grossly generalizing.

It also brings me and my local community togther, which is nice for the many who aren't equipped with stable social lives. Jesus loves you Woah there This is some real Cosmicism thinking. 10s of thousands of years of theology? Obliterated, reduced to mere atoms. Christards? Owned 😎 It really just depends on what we really believe in. If you believe in God then just believe. Then there are others that might be making up beliefs then calling it ""religion.""

God may be true to some but Religions are definitely man-made beliefs. Coming from r/all. If it’s forced or violent like it is in India of course. But you need to be able to believe what you believe in. some people just need it for hope. So fuck the religion that is inciting violence in India. I think we all secretly know this, but it's a nice distraction to believe in it instead of just believing that we're all gonna just die and become nothing. At least that's why I believe in religion. Religion isn’t evil, people are.

Sorry to burst your bubble love, but you seem a lot more childish with your little temper tantrum then any random religious person just minding their own business. 

I understand where you’re coming from, to atheists people of faith may easily appear as delusional fools who pray to a god to make themselves feel better about their existence...but who are we to take that from them? Who are we to snatch away their hope so cruelly? If it makes them happy, and indeed, encourages them to live a more moral lifestyle for fear of god’s wrath or the afterlife, then what is the harm? 

You accuse them of being foolish to believe in man made stories, but science is the same in that regard...in my eyes, the latter has far more credibility, but it is still just another concept manning has come up with in a desperate attempt to explain the word around us. 

It is, with all due respect, simply idiotic to say religion is the only thing that divides us...mankind is capable of deep kindness and empathy, but we are also capable of mindless hatred and violence. It is not religion to blame, but us. We allow any and all differences to divide us, be they religion, economic status, race, nationally, gender, sexual identity, or even age...it is foolish to try and blame religion for the endless bloodshed we cause. 
Indeed, it could easily be argued that, using your vehement rant as an example, it is also the very lack of religion that divides people.

I am not claiming religion is a force for good, but it is not a force for evil either. Merely a tool, used and twisted by humans for their own purposes. Some use it for good, spreading love and support, others use it to pit people against each other. Attack the people misusing it, not the religion itself. Do not give those people the excuse of blaming their religion. Their actions are their own.

Being an atheist does not mean you have to hate religion, or people who follow one. We pride ourselves on our oh so great logic, and then go around mindlessly mocking and hating people of faith, for what? Because it provides an easy scapegoat for us to take our frustrations with the world out on? If it helps them live a happier life, so be it! 

Live and let live!

Sorry for the long and drawn out response everyone, but I cannot understand why atheists insist on such a harsh attitude towards religion. 

Just because someone of some religion may have hurt you, doesn’t make religion inherently bad. Indeed, there are elements of religions that anyone could benefit from, e.g. meditiation

I’d highly recommend Alain de Botton’s ‘Religion for Atheists’ to anyone who’s interested :) Damn dude, you sound so certain. I’ll pray for you. lol Happy birthday! Seems unfair to lump in Buddhism with the others, it’s really more of a philosophy or way of thinking than a true religion. Soooo edgy. Regardless of how you feel about religion, its hard to deny that having a belief system and being forced to believe you have accountability for your actions in this life is not a bad thing for most people. This rant sounds reads like an adolescent emotional outburst. Chances are something in your past with religion has you stuck in an angry place. There certainly is value in discussing the worth of religion in general or just one in particular, but this is off the mark. Come back at it after you figure out what's really hurting you so bad. I mean we really don't know though, let people live. Those who try to force you to live or act some certain way can surely get fucked. I am not religious at all, but you talk about death like you died and came back to tell us what happened. You don't know that there is no rebirth or what happens after death. Get off your non-religious pedestal. You could make a religon out of this! Is it that time of the month? Many prayers needed here for many lost souls! I pray you learn and accept the truth before it’s too late! God sent us his only Son to be sacrificed so we can enter the kingdom of heaven. He died to save us as we are all sinners. Yes I am a Christian but I don’t believe in any specific religion. All you're doing with this post is isolating every religious person from your cause and contributing to the stereotype that atheists are unreasonable Tldr... but i agree. That's one opinion Whoever you are i love u! “The only that happens is you blackout and stop existing” 

Please prove that.

Y’all atheists have so much fucking hate You preaching the fact there is no god is the same as someone shoving religion down your fucking throat. You are as much of a cunt as the Pope. You're also a pussy if you're wondering. Ive recently been coming to terms with how ridiculous I think it is that everyone blames god for their success.  God didn't create modern technology, or scientific breakthroughs, or medical breakthroughs..

We did.  Human beings did all of it.  Everyone says how amazing God is, but they're all wrong.  Its not God who is amazing.  It is us that is amazing. bruh chill the fuck out, check out nihilism btw. Preach brother! Who is God to a non believer. I don’t like any religion. I’d rather have a simple life without thinking who i’m offending by not doing things by their bullshit superstitious sense.
I don’t know if religion is the problem or not. But i will say this: people have forgotten the faith that comes with the religion. They forgot that the biggest thing they need to do while worshipping their god is believing in him no matter what others say. If you get offended when someone questions or makes fun of your religion, then i’m sorry to say, its not having faith, its just being a fan of something and defending it just for selfish reasons (to prove that you can never be or choose something wrong). There’s no reason to be physical or offensive by other’s remarks, because what religion is only an agnostic’s benefit of doubt. Not sure I'd class Buddhism a religion. It can be if you want to believe all the made up magical shit. But it's more of a self help guide. someone needs to get laid The only part I disagree with is what happens when you die.. no fade to nothingness. Instead we’ll all be trippin our balls off on DMT. You’ve lost. You can make a religion out of this. You need Jesus You are going to be very surprised when you die.  I would not take the chance.  Besides, we all have to believe in something.


Its OK..I k ow you are made, but. Don't be made at religion..that's just crazy.

So, what is really the PROBLEM? oof To “blackout” is difficult to grasp if there is nothing further. If mind does not go further it cannot know “blackout”. Well written piece. I do have some questions. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. 
- Does this involve not caring about other species? Because religion does involve loyalty, to a point it’s blind. 


We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. 
-yeah, no on that. If you have a darker skin colour it doesn’t matter to some, who or what you believe in. Also, let’s learn from a war that is now known as the Second World War. Any suggestions how to go about these differences? 

As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. 
- Not always: ask anti-vaccine people among others


Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.
- I don’t agree with this statement, but holy cow, does history and recent events make it hard to disprove. Nothing divides us except religion? LOOL talk about someone not living in the real world. Now your are starting to get it.. God would not want to restrict his children but let them have their own free will. Name one religion where they preach free will over what they tell you are their standards.. Sir, this is a Wendy's. Sjw think its a unpopular opinion and they can go fuck themselves Amen. This is some good shit right here. I'm glad you said it man because this is shit i want to tell people every single day. The world would be immensely better without religion. Im underage and my parents force me to Go to church every Sunday morning i fins It a waste of time too >A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals and started making clay potteries, we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. **The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age.**

You're full of shit, buddy. All those discoveries Man found and made use of also facilitated murder, genocide, and invasions. This was done *eons* before the concept of religion was ever a thing, yet you don't point that out.

>Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.

Except genetic research have discovered many biological nuances in different ethnicities. So no, we are not the same.

>As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed.

The same science that created the atomic bomb? The same science that is behind mass surveillance threatening our privacy?

>Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Absolutely brilliant analysis, Lord Edge. yeah fuck god for making us suffer because some bitch ass took a bite from an apple It’s all nice saying all this but the fact of the matter is that the world you’ll I’ve in now has been shaped by religion, from the laws we have to infrastructures and landmarks so it can be said that religion is very much integrated into our society and it ain’t budging. As long as you practice your chosen faith and it isn’t affecting anyone else then yeah you be you. But religion ain’t going anywhere anytime soon soooooooooooooo..... deal with it I guess. 

Also don’t think religion is a bad thing, it’s given meaning to many peoples lives and this is where people comment of all the terrorism and wars....

Listen I don’t deny them but all throughout history there have been humans that do atrocious things, not religion. A philosophy can’t force you to do anything, it’s man that has committed those crimes. E.g Ghent is Khan, hitler - was denounced from Christianity, tried to create his own sect. Etc... Average redditor Sir, this is a Wendy's Amen to that :D no seriously totally agree I believe religions are a for of social psychology I only know that I don’t know Why no rebirth?? We were born already once right?? You're saying that cant happen again?? Goddamn there's so much hatred in this post? Did a priest put something in your butt? Did a Muslim bang your sister? It must suck to have that much negativity and hate you your mind all the time holy shit lol. And yet, at the end of the day, the epistemology of OP is exactly the same as a person of faith. There’s a lot of anger/pain in this post, but ultimately who truly knows with 100% certainty? No one. Humans divide thrmselves among many other factots aside from religion such as politics, race, income and even miniscules things like liking a band or if you're even a 'real fan'. The danger of religion is that not only do not a lot of people respect the authority which is God but people don't even believe in him as you cannot see or hear him and as a result logically it's fuckin stupid to believe in such a ridiculous  notion as God. If religion were to dissappear from this world would the world be a better place-probably not. As humans we will divide and fight with each other over other factors which will cause new problems. At the core of it as humans we always fight and divide ourselves with political and philosophical ideologies that aren't even extreme in nature as well as the ones that are naturally violent and call for violence. Buddhism’s pretty cool but, not really a profit machine just like an intrinsic sorta thing. Idk I’ve always respected it How about Rastafarianism? Ngl India is the most wretched place on this planet. Then life would be pointless. Bet op deals with constant mental issues and isn't far from suicidal. ...on the other hand, imagine how frighteningly overpopulated our planet would now be without the endless centuries of Divinely Deferential human slaughter.
""Attention Please: Converts, brunch is now being served in the dining hall; Blasphemers, report at once to the Client Intake window located in the East Concourse beside Death Pit 47-B."" I feel like this post is as likely to convince a religious person to drop religion as it is to try and convert OP to whatever religion Funny thing here about the writer of this rant regarding F*** all Religions.. Wonder if he/she in anytime in their lifes had prayed to God for anything.. I believe in a God...I don't have to hear him or see him to know something is responsible for the making of us for better or worse As much as I agree with this statement, it seems you have some historical facts wrong. I may be wrong too, but I'm pretty sure we didn't make tools from obsidian (at least that early), homo sapiens migrated out of Africa around 70 000 years ago, we started farming around 11 000 years ago, bricks were invented around 7500 BC and pottery around 30 000 BC, iron melts at 1500°C and was found around 6000 BC. Also I've never heard of a religion that's trying to take us back to the stone age.


And yes, I am fun at parties. How can you claim to know what happens after death? You have just as much or less proof for your atheistic, nihilistic, scientific world-view as any religious person does for theirs. Here are some fun facts about Equador. Im not from there but i talked to a girl from there that is a police officer and she told me about some laws and punishments they have for breaking them. The city she lives in is almost entirely atheist. If you get married in a church or you baptise your child in a church you will face 40 years of jail time. I know it sounds ridiculous but for example punishment for killing an animal or even abusing it is 35 years in jail, so i guess it could make sense. In my country on the other habd you got massive protests and religious walks about some law that gives the state right to take tax from churches and its property. Property in question are hotels, beaches, and so on that belong to church and that isnt paying any tax because it belongs ti the church. Dozens of millions of euros goes over those properties and nothing is taxed until now and people are mad because 'goverment is stealing the holy property to themselves'. Like wtf, those priests drive most expensive cars in my country, and yet people that barely even goes to church are defending them blindly like church stands above the state and ni laws apply to it. They want to drag us back couple of hundreds years in the past. So yes. Religion is the biggest problem in the world, and world woukd be much better and more peaceful if there wasn't any religions. Most wars were started because of religion, and all those beliefs in The Bible are pure mythology and fantasy, and it involves a lot if gore and sacrificing of people. Like yeah Noah lived over 300 years and people believe that. If you think this is about religion, you're very sorely wrong. 
It's tribalism; My group vs your group
This has absolutely nothing to do with religion and you know it. 

Religion is God's elicudiation of the proper lifestyle for man. What was best for him.

You're as delusional to believe in evolution (not all evolution) as the reason for humanity existing as it. Is today. You nor any scientist has EVER OBSERVED this type of change in a species over time. 
When you DO LET ME KNOW,  CAUSE IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

The people who don't have values and respect for each other are often born into religion. Then they don't care for it so they mold it into something for their own devices. Hence the people who can't understand when to fight and when not to. 

Islam is around 15% of India. If you expect them to do nothing and not defend themselves you lack as much empathy as the people fightning now. The Catholic church did get on Galileo’s case about his findings back then. I find it ridiculous that the Pope hasn’t condemned the ignorance of the early days of the church on its stance on astronomy and science. But it helps the needy and poor. It also teaches you good morals. /s Tbh youre right but I know that theyre so many bad things threw religion, which also even god hated he hated that we were killing people and then because of the bad things they did he punished them. But still I'm a believer I do understand your perspective tho which is also kinda mine. Im still kinda thinking tho but Imma still believe cuz the reward is higher in the long run IF its real so imma end it with amen peace bro. u/userleansbot You're  having that kind of bad day huh .

Heard about religious factions killing each other in Indians . Better hope you are right.. This is amazing. Thank you. I want to share it with every religious person I know. I don't know why this much hate on religion without actually knowing one. Religion Fandom is the oldest, You know what's current ? Cristiano Ronaldo Vs Messi, XBOX vs PS4, Castes, Region, Race, Color, etc..See I respect your views that Religion is a problem but Religion is not a problem, It became a problem because we are feeding a radical group called RSS and a Political Party name BJP. Who trying there best to highlight this Fandom of people. It's like One African came into your society and That one aunty who slowly told you one news, fact, history or fake information regarding the situation of African in africa, Slowly that one aunty became a group and one day society committee will bring up the issues and soon that family needs to leave the society. Same If you are bachelor. Even If you don't do anything bad some societies eventually kick you out because some so and so aunty feed the ears of society head that you were doing this and that.. Instead of Blaming the religion, We need to tackle this power.

When a PM said ,"" You can identify them by their clothes "" 
Yes, No religion teach Hate. No atheism or No Humanity taught you to hate on the basis of anything, be it religion or If you are the fan of Messi and I'm of Ronaldo. You making comments on reddit, by using your smartphone maybe, Quote what ? That's like last 200 years or so ? You know how easy a human mind distracts from things ? Did you know that, If your father said to you that Ohh boy use that Radio and listen songs, Your reply would be ,"" No dad, I have my smartphone "". You once used a DVD now not, Everything changes so fast. Science, technology etc. 

Did you know that religion in human history is one of the oldest and that So called Fandom is still going pretty strong. A human brain, who changes so frequently, throughout eras drop various things but why not religion ? Did you ever try to put your thoughts on that ? Why Religion is the Oldest stuff we got with us. Man People came and go, Many years fall apart, Civilizations come and go, technologies and Everything but this religion is still up in Human Life. 
So...I'm not an atheist but Whatever..I know someone created us and religion and everything going on is what the creater wishes for. We are in a movie which got a start and end. Watches one hitchens video What evidence do you have for this, that racism is being pushed further from core society. Look around you, racism is also integrated into the very structure of our society. Akala explains this very well if you watch a video of his. 

And remember, racism isnt an actively negative act to most. Religion is held in a different respect, like I said it has given meaning to most peoples lives and only small groups have taken advantage of it and become extremes of it. Truth be told if every religious person was “destructive” and dangerous then the whole world would be screwed because there would a civil war in every country. The truth is that, especially on reddit, people create perceptions of religions that deviate from the truth due to confirmation bias. What most on this site call echo chambers. 
This isn’t to say there aren’t any problems in religion. Long time ago I learned myself to manage not to fall in this religion dogma's. 
Believe it guys, it's really nice to see around. There are lot to see. Do you realise that by fucking all religions you become an atheist? Do you also realise that even atheists are kafirs? So unless you a paedophilic Mohammed follower, your life will be fucked up anyway. Better fuck Islam. Well said, well said! Agree with most of the comments here. Religions is the main root cause of unsettlements like wars, etc. We cannot deny that it is the inevitable result of our imaginations, the driving force that distinguishes us from other animals. It has contribute towards the advancement of human history.
Please refer to the book Sapiens: brief history of makind. Gives a more insightful and less biased view on religion. I don't particularly like the ideological references in response to violence, I do enjoy their message of peace,harmony and humanity as a brotherhood of one rather then a nation of many. 

The Nacaals never taught religion but they did mention the Grand Architect who is also referred to as ""Yahweh, God, etc. 

It's unfortunate individuals used that knowledge to pursue goals of greed and profit, to turn a coin off information of wealth. 

When we noticed your hearts weren't ready, we rescinded and left, in hopes in the future you could reach ascension and reach a higher vibrational attunement with the cosmos and the Grand Architect. 

You humans are so clueless as to what you are and as to why your DNA was programmed in such a manner to exist as a tangible organism and as a energetic electro-magnetic essence which travels through the galaxy using the ambient energy as highways through ""space-time"". 

Keep searching for answers, keep questioning the obvious, their are forces out their trying to supress your ascension and the consul suggests we not interfere untill you reach your ""pinnacle"". FUCK JUDAISM! Bravo Sooooo... Religion bad... But the industrial age good?

Humans have done more damage to the Earth in the past century than all the tens of thousands of years prior combined--and it's not because of religion that we've desecrated the world. That's for sure. That’s just one article instead of running your keyboard perhaps you should do some research . You can find the studies that have been done, I personally believe you are more competent than you act.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/Technology/computer-scientists-prove-god-exists/story%3fid=20678984 Well, since you said so. SMH. Love Is My Religion Im sorry for what you have experienced, but not all religion is the same. Some are misinterpretations of Gods word, and many are meant to manipulate.
Personally i have witnessed miracles, and the existance of God is irrefutable to me, but i know that not all have that luxury.

Anyone who judges you for non-belief when you havent seen the work of God is mislead, as you are only responsible for what you know. Mike you behind most violence and instigation you'll find atheist who would sometime claim that they follow a certain religion As a christian, cool i respect your religion of no religion. Ew Religious riots like this just continue to fuel my atheism. I sometimes feel this entire world is simulation.  

Check the digital world , we all are communicating in digital form , not physical.  


So what's before physical form? 

Spiritual form maybe just my guess . well, bro fuck atheist China and North Korea too. (i mean mao kill count is higher than Ashoka Hindu ruler with maximum kill count).

also, our sun may not go supernova (and become white dwarf).   I believe people should follow a religion but not let it define it as what they are. Zzzzzz boring rehashed opinion. People have been saying this forever, it's not revolutionary, just a boring old take. Get some new material. Religion only reflects the true nature of most humans .....weak and gullible....unable to accept death, or for others, life itself..as stupid as it sounds. ""Which is more likely: that all natural order is suspended, or that a Jewish minx should tell a lie? There has to be an answer to this."" - Christopher Hitchens You sound like a fundamentalist. preach my brother *Sorts by controversial* Preach So you believe a world without religion would be better? What you wrote gives a sense of misinformation. Maybe you're too young to know. 


Anyway, religion itself is a non-issue, humans themselves are vile and exclusive. If you think atheism would solve anything, you're wrong. Look at China, they are atheists. 


Many of the idiotic things that we do are driven by religion but if religion were to cease existing, we will latch onto something else. 


Religion isn't the problem it has never been. Extremism is the problem. People reach these extreme conclusions without proper research or thought process. Facts Sounds like OP is about to lead the atheist religion against all other religions in an non-holy war. How bout people just believe what they want and everyone stops trying to tell/force others what to believe. You sound like someone told you something that you don’t like 😬😂 Religion should never have had ties with worldly powers but in the course of time, it has. In my view, power bestowed to man must not be muddled with religious beliefs. 

Religion got its bad reputation because of the dominance of religious men in power over the masses. 

It doesn't matter what religion you are, if you are trying to tie in power with your beliefs then you're most likely not doing it right. >""Reflect that the dead suffer no evils, that all those stories which make  us dread the nether world are mere fables, that he who dies need fear  no darkness, no prison, no blazing streams of fire, no river of Lethe,  no judgment seat before which he must appear, and that Death is such  utter freedom that he need fear no more despots. All that is a phantasy  of the poets, who have terrified us without a cause. Death is a release  from and an end of all pains: beyond it our sufferings cannot extend: it  restores us to the peaceful rest in which we lay before we were born. ""

\- Seneca, Consolation of Marcia

[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of\_Consolation:\_To\_Marcia](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_Consolation:_To_Marcia) Reading this makes me wonder how even more fucked up an atheist country the size of India would be. [deleted] Religion by itself is not a problem but religious extremism or any kind of extremism for that matter is. 

Similar to capitalism is not bad but crony capitalism is or socialism is not bad but communist dictatorship is or Patriotism is not bad but nationalism is. Currently reading remembrance of earth's past trilogy. It really seems that we need trisolaris level threat and the proof of existence of a dark forest to finally unite as humans and forget all religions. My man :) Well you are close but forgot one thing, fuck humanity. There is no need to do this bs of making world a better place or whatever that means. This earth, science, climate change and all doesn’t really matter. It is a just biological instinct to think we need to save our species, progress and other bs, overall nothing really matters (atleast there is no evidence it does). Humans have propagated this idea that human life is valuable, we should continue reproducing and then try to keep creating societal and economic structures to live comfortably for no reason whatsoever. What about Pascal’s Wager?

https://youtu.be/BlfX9LNrl6E You can't say 💯 percent surely that God doesn't exist..the probability isn't 0 after all.. Faith is not bad. Religion/institution is Just maybe fuck all religion is not the answer? Be an atheist, believe in a God, whatever makes you happy. But be a good human being first. Do no harm as stated by OP. 

The problem with attacking religion so blatantly is that most of the world still believes in something. This is bound to change over time but till then, we can't just say fuck religion and all our problems will be solved. So...ok. What about spirituality? You don't know for sure that everything goes black and we cease to exist. I'm not defending a belief in the afterlife at all, just stating a fact. I had the same feelings as you at one point, I still struggle with it tbh. Yes there has been a lot of blood spilled over religions, but there has also been a lot of good things that came from it as well. A good moral code for ppl at the least. I have my doubts about religion but spirituality is a different thing all together. You are judging this life on tangible things in a world we still don't fully understand. Religion could have helped those sheep herders thousands of years ago to fill the gaps of what they don't understand and as far as we have come since then, there is still so much to be explained through science. No one on this plane of existence right now knows what happens for sure after death. Why be another one that says they know what does or doesn't happen then? That's a little hypocritical. One of those gaps in what we understand could explain what will happen to us spirituality (not religiously)  after what we think is life in this reality is over. I don't think there are definite answers to it, so no one can truly say we go here or there or we cease to be. I notice you left out Scientology. Interesting.  hes a little confused but hes got the spirit You bealive in a lot of nonsense why I can't bealive in God. Actually some of the mass genocide weren't made cuz religion. Socialism have killed more people in the last century. If fuck all religion, then what is the purpose of life?

Why do religigion keep appearing?

Why when people are helpless they’re looking for some being to help them? If you are thinking religion is the root cause for all kind of wars you are WRONG. 

Humans are chaotic in nature just like animals. Humans shed blood even before religion exists. Its just our sixth sense stopping us to do so but its still uncontrollable, in the end human love to war, love to slave others, love to destroy others not belong to their group/race/religion/country/continent/language/direction etc etc etc. all these are just a reason for war, if there is no religion am pretty much sure humans will kill each other for whatever the other reason they can think off. 

In the end it doesn’t matter, who are all died are going to get replaced by new births, its not like humans are going to get extinct, i only see it as a way of population control.

If you are smart enough... like me...
Let them fight and kill each other.
Dont get emotional, dont pick side and ioin the war. Just watch them kill each other. Enjoy this quote will you now 

“The more I read, the more puzzled I was by the order of the universe and the disorder of the human mind, by the scientists who didn’t agree on the how, the when, or the why of creation.

Then one day this student brought me Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. Reading Kant, I began to suspect everything I was taught. I no longer believed in the known God of the Bible, but rather in the mysterious God expressed in nature.

The basic laws of the universe are simple, but because our senses are limited, we can’t grasp them. There is a pattern in creation.

If we look at this tree outside whose roots search beneath the pavement for water, or a flower which sends its sweet smell to the pollinating bees, or even our own selves and the inner forces that drive us to act, we can see that we all dance to a mysterious tune, and the piper who plays this melody from an inscrutable distance—whatever name we give to it —Creative Force, or God—escapes all book knowledge.

Science is never finished because the human mind only uses a small portion of its capacity, and man’s exploration of his world is also limited.

Creation may be spiritual in origin, but that doesn’t mean that everything created is spiritual. How can I explain such things to you? Let us accept the world is a mystery. Nature is neither solely material nor entirely spiritual.

If we want to improve the world we cannot do it with scientific knowledge but with ideals. Confucius, Buddha, Jesus and Gandhi have done more for humanity than science has done.
We must begin with the heart of man—with his conscience—and the values of conscience can only be manifested by selfless service to mankind.

Religion and science go together. As I’ve said before, science without religion is lame and religion without science is blind. They are interdependent and have a common goal—the search for truth.

Hence it is absurd for religion to proscribe Galileo or Darwin or other scientists. And it is equally absurd when scientists say that there is no God. The real scientist has faith, which does not mean that he must subscribe to a creed.""

Science is just as valuable as the non plagiarised scripture is.... to know what is plagiarised what can be trusted as raw knowledge is Upto you , you will find the further you go back the more genuine it gets , if you are not savvy enough to separate the gold from the shit then that’s your problem not mine.. 

Look mate for a start you can’t have much of an idea about the nature of ancient scripture for claiming Buddhism a religion like Islam or orthodox fundamentalism that we see saturating the globe now be alike , I see Tibetan teaching as sacred sciences as do I knowledge of the Jains and Vedic roots in general , just a different perception of ultimately the same things that is of the flip side to the coin - still the same coin though  , how many words I can turn atom into something that’s related to the Vedas like Atman , many examples alike... 

I don’t let religious fundamentalism ruin what was once and still is known , raw knowledge  ; it’s both on a physical and metaphysical level , I relate most of what Vedic teaches to quantum mechanics for example... ""The more I read, the more puzzled I was by the order of the universe and the disorder of the human mind, by the scientists who didn’t agree on the how, the when, or the why of creation.

Two sides of the same coin , each making up eachother 

“The rishis tell us of the galactic center of the universe, which feeds energy to all the galaxies and solar systems of the universe. A modern discovery is beginning to reinforce this belief. To explore this three centers must be identified, 1) the center of a solar system (Sun), 2) The center of a galaxy, 3) the galactic center of the universe. Our focus here will be on the first two centers. In exploring these two centers we will discover the current Hindu principles of Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu at work. Those these same principles can be explored using the galactic center of the universe also.” https://www.boloji.com/articles/1490/modern-black-hole-theory

Doesn’t sound much like a religion to me does Hindu and Jain , Buddhism more like sacred sciences that offers a deferent view point on the same questions , real science does have some sort of faith ....

 I just think you are terribly mislead and have let religious fundamentalism turn you into abit of a hard headed nob head to tar them all off under the same brush like that is one of the most ignorant of things going and ultimately it is you that looses out this man said fuck christian😭😭 who the fuck is christian This comment section is proof that regardless of religion existing or not, humans will still eat the heads off each other over misplaced self righteousness. TL, DR Thing is Sikhism is amazing. It just teaches you how to be the strongest version of yourself. Women are queens Men are Kings. Sikhs have been screwed so many times because it’s just a religion that makes you a successful and strong person. Others religions don’t want it to rise. Sikhs don’t attack first there has to be a BIG reason for them to attack. They mostly defend. beautiful wording but shit man, I don’t want to die staring at the dark abyss for eternity, and for that reason i’m out... What problem you have with Buddhism, bro ?
I know it's your fraustration speaking but just tell me cons of Buddhism, I might get your facts about Buddhism corrected.
Peace. How is this related to India Life never dies on earth 
It reproduces itself
Which is why humans crave for sex so much. [deleted] Ok one thing is not believing in religion which I also don’t , but you fucking fuck head who are you to feed people this bullshit ? I have always been against religion and all the problems it brought us , but one thing I know , and if you had hallucionogetics before you would know better , life it’s not just this , bro/sister if you are not religious it doesn’t mean you have to think that life is just this , make your own mind take your own perspective because atheist is another religion for me and another group of fuck heads trying to act like they know the truth of life lol peace I agree but i think Agnosticism  is more of the solution at least in my case because I do believe in God but that nigga don't give a fuck fr so... and we don't understand that meaning in itself so religion makes not sense cause you cant tell anybody shit about God cause we all know the same amount . P.S. In DBZ King Kai is a God and that nigga lets people die on the daily so it makes no sense to the they care. And i speak about caring cause we are selfish beings so if someone don't care about us we no care bout dem. I bet you think you're a genius for writing this. Like really, what a revelation you are bringing us here I am Christian and I used to believe in the same thing as you, but one thing got in my way:

If we die and that's it, were dead how do we remember now? It's hard to even wrap my own head around, but hear me out, if we just die and that's it how can I remember this moment right now? 

Honestly just a question, not a statement. NOT RECOMMENDED 

Most atheistic society like soviet union who were anti religion as marx said ""reliong is opioid for masses""
KILLED 40-60 MILLION mostly by fast track courts, starvation. 

NAZI's absolutely hated orthodox narratives and set out to eradicate suffering endedup killing 40-50 MILLION. Lol I really disagree with the ‘supernova’ part of your comment. The fate of our sun is to become a red dwarf, its not big enough to supernova. The rest seems reasonable. My religion is rajma chawal. It is totally okay if you don't believe in god but why do you have to talk bad about religions just because you don't believe in it. Religion means to everyone something else and thats completely fine. I just don’t understand why people can’t accept that there are people who believe in God or believe in nothing. Religion is not only about what happens after your death it’s also about many other things. If you are born, for example in a muslim family you don’t have to be a muslim you can just convert to an other religion or believe in nothing. I just don’t get it why you have to hate or judge people who are religious or believe in nothing you should just accept them. My dad grew up in a very religious household and was very religious himself. But as he got older, moved out and got married he started to lose his belief, so it is possible to change one’s belief. I am an atheist/agnostic, I don’t believe in God (a agnostic doesn’t normally cut out the possibility of there being one God or multiple God’s but I personally don’t believe in God) but I think that there could be something after death. I believe in what I can see or in what is already proven by science. Still I think all religions deserve the get accepted and respected. I still don’t get why people hate and judge others by their religion or/and belief. I am very nearly one hundred percent behind you only there is this tiny little voice that whispers that bit from the Bible "" the fool sayeth in his heart there is no God"" but organised religion? not worth a damn Why can't you allow people to have their own beliefs. Why be a cunt so if i say anything about my religion im pushing to down peoples throats, BUT when atheist come here and say no religion is true because of science its not considered pushing your beliefs down my throat?? thats just hypocrisy. Relax dude. Religion is a belief I have no problem with that but saying that I should believe in it too and forcing the principles of religion on us is so fkin annoying While I am a strict atheist, I still wonder if religion is necessary for society or not? A religion does not always fucks up everyone, at its core it teaches moral code. Why do people pay beggars? Do they not feel morally obliged? Religion even creates jobs. Tourism is the main industry here. A religion also is a great tool to keep the masses in checks. How many politicians make religion their chief propaganda? India has a population of 1.3+ billion. But since the majority here believes in religion, there is a sincere moral code that is followed here even by those in the lowest ranks of society. And their reason is ""god will not forgive us otherwise"". 

Thus I think that religion need reformation and modernization more so. 
The main thing that religions need is to burn their texts. Those unscientific teachings completely make every follower irrational. Then it needs to purge the ""dhongis"". There are some very genuine religious heads who teach the right conduct instead of their donation account numbers. And stop mixing politics with religion. That is the worst thing that can happen. Religion is bad in many ways because political leaders will go to any lengths to appease people. 

And frankly, somehow people are always more eager to listen to all irrational things in religions. Remember those glorious tales of Ramayana and Mahabharta. People want to listen to those because it helps them escape reality. 

""People believe people but not necessarily ideals or institutions.""
             ~Yang Wen-Li

Therefore religions are inevitable. But genuine leaders can make religions good. The masses do not believe facts, they believe what they want to believe. The only thing missing is the scientific revolution only began ~500 years ago...which means there is no science *in* those archaic (and current) texts. 
No mention of all that we can see of our universe. You lost me at ""have faith in people"" Why not just let people practice religion if it isn't hurting anyone? Religion can help certain people become better or go through tough times. Only in INDIA Money is also evil. Its actually the root of all evil. It power all politician and religious groups, money also divides us. FUCK MONEY I'm open to criticism on this. However,

Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder? I agree thoroughly with a lot of the points you have made (obviously quite passionately), however to sum up the net worth of religion in society as '' mass murder and hardship'' is quite juvenile and quite frankly, false. Science and Religion are separate facets in social lives that are personal to each individual. All major world religions base their beliefs on pre existing human morals and either give them a narrative or an incentive to uphold traditional moral values. I personally believe a breakdown in faith and lack of belief in the preexisting religious moral institution led to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s and look where that left us.

'' Leave your religion'' - I genuinely hope that was passionate rhetoric rather than what you truly believe. Any anti-freedom of religion country would be morally bankrupt. Freedom of expression and freedom of speech are essential to any working democracy. The same passionate rhetoric in reverse would be condemned by the media as crude conversion tactics. 

Obviously the government should be secular and religion should never be checked in government forms nor in college applications. 

I've definetly pissed off a few people. But rather than shouting slogans and holding a pseudo-moralistic stance, what we need in genuine discourse. You'll start believing them once you experience real paranormal things. ;) Spirits/Souls are true. As a Canadian, I feel that you have a right to your opinion but you shouldn't be criticising people for believing something you don't agree on.

Who cares if this person believes one thing? Accept your differences and move on. 

At the end of the day, we're all human. Don't judge by belief. Hmmm When you say there is evil in this world, you assume there's good. By what standard do you different between good and evil? If we're just matter, there is no evil, there is no good. To have an objective moral law, there should be a Moral law giver. Let me just start off by saying that humans are always looking for idols. This idol has to be a representation of a person. It can be a politician, a teacher, or anything. Indian teens often look at Bollywood celebrities and cricketers as their idols. Therefore, it's a human tendency to look out for idols. However, all these idols are human. When these humans make mistakes, their hard-earned idol breaks. In this comparison to this human idol, the idols of God are the best alternative. They represent perfection, and they can never break. This is because Gods are believed to never make mistakes and always provide the best path in life. That's why people so blindly believe in them.

Now that clear, I wanna say that if you want to break religion today, then it's possible. You can truly break these idols. However, I can guarantee you that there will be something that will pop up in the next 100-500 years. It doesn't have to be mainstream religion like today. Science can turn out to be a religion possibly when we discover some fundamental truth, and we can become so arrogant that we will forget to look at other perspectives except the laws of physics. 

The reason for this permanent existence of religion is not the blind faith of people but the source of order in our society. In the 12 Rules For Life by Jordan Peterson, Peterson brings a compelling argument that in our world, and possibly the universe, there are forms of **order** and **disorder**.  This is the true meaning of the Chinese philosophical concept of Yin and Yang. The popular symbol of the two white and black fishes. The white represents order, hierarchy, cultures, discipline, faith, traditions while the black represents disorder: freedom, innovation, creativity, disorder, chaos, unpredictability, no-rules. What's so interesting is that you can see this duality around you. I definitely recommend you all to read this book. Note that both sides of the model have positive and negative impacts.  So basically, an ideal society is one that has a balance of both. But historically this hasn't been so. You will observe the whole human race making radical shifts from one state to another. When there are too many wars and there is no morality in people, then a new religion arises and attempts to create peace by asserting codes by which people can adhere to. This is a shift towards order. However, with time, the rules only grow and become overpowering to an extent that the religion may appear as oppression or tyranny. Then our society has a rebel who rallies and breaks the religion restoring freedom and free speech. To do this the rebel takes away all the existing rules. But then after some time, with this new freedom, people lose their moral codes.  They take advantage of this freedom and our whole free society turns out to be a blunder. 

The point is that religion or anything in the world is not good or bad. In my perspective, if you promote hate against religion, then there is no difference between you and those religious people who convey the same feelings against atheists and heathens. You are equally as ignorant as them. 

I completely agree that under religion, so many innocents had to suffer. However, I believe that is not true religion. Religion today has become a tool for politicians to sway public support, at least in India. There are riots, arsons, violent crimes, rapes, torture, and so many atrocities committed to defending religion. There are also these so-called spiritual babas that teach ways of ignorance and bigotry.

The problem arises because people feel that religion is told to them. To me, no Godamn retard can tell me what to do, what my religion is! Religious knowledge or spiritual knowledge actually arises from within. You have to sense your soul yourself. A guru only helps you in recognizing yourself. A soul and consciousness may be meaningless to you, and I respect the opinion. To me, the exploration of this soul is aesthetic and worth it.

I believe I'm a religious person. I'm a Hindu. Yet my religion or my own taking of it doesn't force me to hate other religions. Rather I'm quite fascinated by Sufism, and it's my dream to go to the Nizamuddin Dargah. Religion does not make me feel that I matter or that God will come and help me from my misery. While being religious, I just admire the beauty of the world. This is my opinion on it. You can have a different one, and I will respect it. Although, religion is what got us here. To civilization. Whether it is useful now or not is a matter of debate, but humans being the dominant species on the planet is largely a contribution of religion. Religion and spirituality are different. Religion can be more elaborately defined as a way of living or what we call in Sanskrit as 'Dharma'. But most times we forget that if religions did not exist, we would not be where we are now. Religion has played a great role in the development of human civilisation. If one doesn't believe in god, that doesn't mean they should criticize religion. 

We turned religion and culture into communalism. That wasn't the true aim. Lol, did you notice how sure you are off your theory. Everything blacks out.

Do you know that you don't know a lot about yourself and this world.

What caused the big bang, how did life originate, what is conciousness,why are you concious of this expirience. 

That's the problem with atheists,you do not like any religion you just jump to conclusions like others did.

Scientists themselves say that they do not know a lot of the universe and it's still very much mysterious. I think there is truth in all of it :)

And you bet your bottom dollar that the people who run the world believe in religion , very very strictly!

But

There must be something more, evil vs good, dark vs light, hero vs villian you can see this with your own eyes and you can feel it in your guts!

In order for there to be light there must be darkness and in order for darkness there must be light ! It's essentially about being prayerful, that's why you can worship anyone & anything in India cuz it's about our well being. God is just a tool. You should fuck whoever you can wherever you can whenever you can, don't qoute me on tha. [removed] Relevant - https://i.imgur.com/B3AC3bv.jpg I too was 13 once Wow this has gotta be dumbest shit i have seen this month or something Cringe This is a stupidly non-informed post. Anything not explainable with logic.....bam happy tripping [removed] I like this guy. Someone's watching Crash Course Philosophy. Aren’t you becoming the very thing you hate by disregarding what others believe and forcing them to follow your path.

Don’t get me wrong, I know your feeling and like the base idea about achieving a better humanity and way of life by self and mutual contribution.

Wouldn’t the better message be “Jio Aur Jeene Do” why bother what others believe or does as long as they contribute to the betterment of the society.

Everyone wants to vent after what’s happening/ has been happening in our country. I love you for having balls to say this straight. Why all the hate on religion? This is something I don't understand. I was raised in a very religious family (LDS). I don't believe it's true, I don't believe in any religion, but what are they really teaching you? aside from the fucked up history, it's only saying be nice, don't kill people. Honestly, please tell me why you hate it so much? If you say it caused wars, bull shit, men cause wars and use religion as an excuse(BTW, if religion wasn't there we'd still have wars). I'm not on religion's side but hate is the real problem with religion. People hating others due to their religious beliefs is the real problem. YOU are the problem, not religion. Stop the hate and embrace the good principals they teach. I don't see any problem with religious people as long as they don't affect other people in a negative way. We don't know the cause of consciousness and you have no basis to claim the only thing that happens after death is your body decaying. Oblivion might be your belief but shoving it down everyone's throat is your fallacy. We don't know a lot about a lot of things and dismissing age old wisdom is not always the answer. You sound a lot like an edgy kid. Staunch atheism and 'rationalism' isn't the only way to go. There's a lot wrong with a lot of religions but their main shortcoming is the believers thinking this is the one and only way to do things, and ironically you share this trait. Another person talking about something they never bothered to study.  And many people agreeing who also never studied the subject.  Lots of retards on both sides of the fence Lol, OP, does creativity need to abide by logic for you be benefited? If you can't see past the literal to uncover the absurd truth about this existence, then what are you doing criticizing religion? The self righteous woke-ness is strong in this thread Nothing divides us except religion? What a farce. this isn't facebook, go jerk yourself off somewhere else. Wow.  This is the best they could do after reports of anti-Muslim lynchings. No post about human rights just a post about religion being evil. Maybe not kill your minorities first. No offense this is how it starts. the rage. the feeling of powerlessness, that turns good men cruel. when you question one's faith. 

you're no different than the people you oppose.

all people are dumb, it's the universal truth. be it anyone, believer or a non believer I'm not a religious but I pity you for your onedimensional view o religion as a whole.

Tbh you seem like a guy who never educated himself in any religion.
I know the situation in your country is bad but condemning every religion just because of that is wrong man. Religion isn't responsible. It's the people that want their religion to be the best, the only religion. People suck, not religion in itself.

and FYI: Stop calling youself atheists when you are not educated in religion. YES. god damn right! Honestly fuck everyone that's not me. Poor guy got rejected at a Baptist single mingle. Edge Super edgy You’re confused. You described religion the way a child would. It’s not about following certain rules and making sure everyone else does the same. It’s more about community and spreading love. Just because you’re exposed to the violence that is brought about by extremists, doesn’t mean the entire idea itself follows the same mentality. 

Also, who are you to explain what happens after death? Last time I checked, none of us have a clue. So I agree that we should live in the moment and cherish it, because it’s all we have. Just admit that you know just as much as the religious,  because otherwise you’re lying to yourself Lmao losers like this actually exist.

E N L I G H T E N E D. I am not saying that god is real or anything but there are so many things that are unexplained. Like why space exists in the first place, stuff like that. So may be there is a 'being' out there or may be there isn't who is responsible for our creation. They could be some higher dimensional being or whatever. But at the very least they are not bothered enough to make contact with us or may be they don't even exist anymore. Whatever the case may be, to glorify them saying they have a 'plan' for all of us is stupid. People make excuses in the name of religion just to define their own hatred and heinous acts.   


Religion is nothing more but an excuse. Going to need less edge on this post. You are all dumb. I would suggest you to do some thoughtful reading before acting as if you know everything. The book is Homo sapiens a history of us. I partly agree, but religion is probably the reason why the world is as it is now. Religion is what United people, made them work together, think together. All ancient empires/countries/civilizations had religion as their cornerstones, and this allowed people to work and build and think in unity. Read the book Sapiens by Yuval Harari, it's a very good book and explains this in deeper depth.
  Edit: its also the reason the government exists An observation, I've never heard a thiest talk like this. It looks like most religious people tend to be pretty happy and here you are pissed at everything.

If believing in ""stories"" has made them happy and you angry, they reap the benefits of a happy life and you get to whine on the internet. If you only get about 80 years of existence, seems like you're spending a lot of time being pissed. Calm down pajeet This is a really passionate anecdotal that immediately loses the idea of what religion is supposed to be. Death to religion! Sir, this is a Wendy's Love this post. Have been wanting to post something of this sort for the longest time, I’m glad someone did. 
Fuck religion. Religion is one of the main reasons the world is going to shit. Ok edgelord if you want to be down with bad boy, then fuck you too 12 years old is a wild time buddy. Hang in there. sounds like it was written by an edgy 12 year old Cringe

Indias problems are because of indians God damn this OP is just a tunnel visioned fuck talking about ""open your mind"". Religion is a set of principles, the adaptation and interpretation by said sick religious fucks is the problem. Humans are the problem. OP, by creating this post, you are the problem because you're having to voice a disdain for religious people, just to be a judgmental POS. You too, do not know the answer to anything, so please, stfu and keep your opinions to yourself. I do not believe in your god ""non existant"" god or the next persons ""existing"" god, but you dont have a right to say there is no god. That is quite literally an uneducated statement. You're sitting there saying ""there is no god how can you be so stupid, you dont know anything!"" while you look like the complete ass due to not knowing universal answers to anything as well. Its just your sad shitty pessimistic outlook on your meaningless life. Oh well, cya. You’re not just wrong, you’re retarded I’m trying to figure out where I asked for your opinion You said Hinduism. So, I will write about Hinduism, nothing else. I think you have a very superficial understanding of Hinduism as a religion. I agree with your rant that all religions have done till now is creating rift and disruption amongst the people of the world. But, that's just a commentary on the aspect of religion followed by the majority of the population and not religion in itself. 

Religion is not going to temples, not eating beef, reciting mantras, singing hymns, making ashrams, subscribing to gurus and holier than thou attitude. Religion is more than that. There's a beauty to it. The philosophies proposed in Hindu scriptures are mesmerizing and intellectually stimulating. The simple rituals prescribed by the scriptures are nourishing to the mind and body. These are some of the beautiful aspects of religion. It's not degrading, discriminatory or condescending towards anyone. Following the crux of a religion requires no violence or any untoward activity. The philosophies outlined in religion basically provides tools and capabilities for better introspection into our existence.

The question of how and why we are here is the essence of all scientific pursuits. Religion/spirituality is just another way to approach the problem. Thousands of years of spiritual research and development has provided us with tools to understand life a little better. This is an alternative to the approach of going with a blank slate or not thinking about it altogether. It's like scientific research, where the knowledge from the past researcher helps to develop our own theories and understanding about a phenomenon. That's what Hindu religion is supposed to mean, at least to me.

I am a proud Hindu. I will always be. To me Hinduism doesn't mean heavens, Gods, Godesses, temples or prayers. I am in love with the philosophical nuances of the religion. That stimulates my scientific mind and helps me become a better human being. That's my opinion. How ignorant and ironic. Fool Making a Reddit post saying ""fuck you"" a lot and telling people they're an idiot for being religious isn't going to change anyone's mind. You're not the first person to do this and won't be the last. 

Are we really going to tolerate such broad generalizations? I'm not one for religion either but seriously. Religion is not the only thing dividing us. Tribalism will always exist, religion or no.

If someone made a post going ""fuck all gays,"" then they would be downvoted to hell, and for good reason. 

So why is it good for someone to do the same to another large group of people, most of which are ordinary human beings? You might be right and you might be wrong but one thing is for sure, you’re a dick. Isn't *that* a great way to win allies and convert others.

""Share my belief set or Fuck Off.""

Sounds almost- I dunno, religious or something. this site has such a hate boner for religion its actually cringe Wow man you're so smart you've figured it all out by yourself. 5000 years of debating on the existance of the lord and you pking3, obviously the smartest and wisest being in the universe, have found the definite answer in your very insightful fuck all religion post.

Thank you and fuck you in the ass for being an absolute teenage retard. I hope after life is real, so I can shit in your fucking mouth for all eternity. You're right: religion has created tremendous hatred and division. It has caused a lot of death and pain. It is also one of the largest contributors to charity of all kinds worldwide, and one of the greatest sources of compassion for people whom society leaves behind. Whether someone who believes in a religion is childish is an individual issue; there is no rule.

But you know what is always childish? Saying, as you're for all intents and purposes saying here, that in spite of physicists', chemists', mathematicians', and biologists' inability to describe the exact workings of an incredibly complex universe as ours, you alone, one person, understand the exact metaphysical function of life and death. Not only that, but you're so convicted of your unproven premise that you're bombastically contemptuous of anyone who disagrees. 

You sound like a 13 year old who just encountered Richard Dawkins for the first time and wants to be edgy. Sit down. ""Open your mind"", ""religion is the source of hate."" In a post filled with vitriolic language and hatred towards large groups of people.  Sucks to break it to you, but hatred is a part of all human experience, not just religious people and your post is evidence of that. I don’t think saying “fuck all your religions” unites anyone, but ok. Me sO eDgY aNd sMaRT cAuSe mE nO bEliEve sKy DaDdY TIL india has teen edge lords too! Glad that you have it all figured out. That sure is a long winded and overly emotional way to say that nobody matters. So why waste your timing screaming into the universe that doesnt give a crap about how you feel or your views.... Your insignificant, what you think doesnt mean anything. God still loves you though, and we all pray for a change in your blasphemous heart. Because at the end of days is the worst way to find out that all this time you where wrong your whole life, and eternity is a sure long time to burn in hell over an idiotic opinion. I agree misinterpretations of Religion can cause violence , yes it has been used by some to control 
The masses .

However saying that there is no creator ... it’s all physics and science .... is pure bull shit .

We barely know the workings of quantum mechanics , we barely know what relativity is , we barely even know the universe , there are a lot of answers that we don’t have .

There could be a creator , we don’t know what form , it could be a civilisation or a spirit or light . We don’t know 

You just can’t say there isn’t a creator , you could instead say we don’t knowwwww if there is one Did you just turn 13? And who the fuck are you to judge what the rest of the world believes in!! Evidently your the one who is dumber than a box of rocks!! Fuck you. Your a piece of garbage I usually just keep my mouth shut and move on on posts like this because it's obvious that this person has no intention of a discussion they just want to state their belief. I am seriously tired of people like this though. No i'm not talking about people bashing religion, you do you, i'm talking about people who are either slightly smarter than the average person or who found a idea thought of by someone smarter than them running around stating their theories as facts because they have been able to shut down arguments brought to them by people who have not put any major thought into it. Y'all are the reason intellectualism has a stigma.
On top of that the whole reason for ""fuck religion"" is the same argument as blaming a weapon for a murder. People are bad, they do bad things and if you remove the tools they are using to do bad things they will just find new ways. Xenophobia hasn't even been solely acted on because of religion, religions just tend to be the largest cultural groups so attacks between them generally have a greater impact. [removed] Who hurt you, OP? Buddhism isn't a religion. Is science your new religion? [deleted] [removed] If you're truly an atheist, a true atheist in word, thought and acts, then for you there should be no concern at all. Because as per your ideology no one has any choice in any matter as the laws of physics and chemistry coupled with the initial conditions of the Big Bang force people to behave exactly as they do. 

Hence, if you inspite of adhering to this ideology try to comment here, fully aware that everyone is genetically determined, so no one should convince anyone, as freewill is non-existent, and hence getting offended or hurt or disagreement are just illusions of a random oscillation. 

Further, if someone wants to blame God, then first accept the existence of God. Don't put blame on someone that as per them doesn't even exist, cause then they're just an emotionally induced atheist, with their roots in emotion not logic, creating principles of evil or good when such principles don't exist in nature. 

If however, you first accept God and hence you want to blame him then you should ask the question - Why should people not suffer, including a child, a seemingly helpless animal or any other. Why is it that they shouldn't suffer? When the question of evil arises, the actual subliminal question that people ask is - ""Why isn't God behaving as per my desire?"" I want to live forever he makes me die, I want unlimited sex, he creates obstacles, I want unlimited tasty treats, he creates fat, diabetes, I want unlimited intoxication he creates drug trauma, whatever I want to do, he creates problems? Why? It's because a compassionate father not only treats but punishes when you do wrong. And the wrong is not just for one birth, but cyclical, and accumulative, when you keep ignoring it, it grows and one day it just bursts. When the worm is eaten by a cat, then one may think the worm suffered, but scriptually the jeeva soul in that worm got trasmuted into a sperm and then born as a kitten, and so on the cycle continues. 

The desire of fools is material pleasure without any sort of disturbance. Disturbance in enjoying such insignificant pleasure is what is regarded as evil by fools. Death, murder, destruction, disease, and suffering of all kinds is the actual evil and all these evils are sent accordingly by God as per your degree of attachment to such material pleasures. The law of karma works in this way - suppose as per some past act you have to die through a head wound, that karma will make someone who wants to beat someone, who has the desire to beat someone, like a gangster come to you, or you go the gangster, the gangster will beat on the head, and then in the future he too will suffer for murdering someone. In this way one being's desire of beating someone and another's beings deservement both are carried out simultaneously. God will fulfill your desire, no matter how evil it is, one day it shall come to pass, in this life or another, but so will it's consequences. Giving up desires or kaama is the basis of liberation or moksha. Kaliyuga is that age when the pending evil desires of beings is heavily unleashed. It's not God making them behave in this fashion, they want to do it themselves. They like killing babies, they like blowing things up, they like raping and looting, and killing the masses, carving their flesh and drinking till they're dead, and birth after birth they keep suffering. 

Out of all the wars, murders, crimes almost all of them have one or more of these 3 motives - 
Lust, Anger or Greed, all of which are categorically curbed in any bonafide religion. 

Holocaust, Holodomor, The Cambodian genocide of 1975, The Armenian Genocide of 1915, the Zunghar genocide etc. which killed 7 times more people than the two world wars combined have been done by the irreligious. You're doing the same thing which you accuse religion of - Collective hate. 

As for the OP, I'm not here to convince anyone, but to say that please behave as per the ultimate conclusions of your own ideology, which is Atheism here, like a random oscillation with no friends or enemies, with no concept of good or evil, as such concepts are imaginary as per the same logic applied. Please practice such atheism ardently. Also, yeah I post at a sub that many people here are averse to, and yeah its because atleast I can say my say over there. Thank You. These kind of liberals are a threat to society. Who just call out and say everyone is equal culprit and don't take a side. These are the liberals who will send an apology after a pogrom and genocide is done. These are the one that give intellectual validation to the extreme right wing. Under the soviet and communists who are majority atheists we have seen far more genocides and these people have hidden. it very well from rest of the world. China Russia have killed more people in the name of religion

Randia loves these liberals who just wants to put us into the same mess. Will no religion change things for India? Definitely no.

Indias problem lies in casteism. Even if you are a atheist you will continue to look down on people who don't follow your ideas or belief. There are atheists in developed countries but there thinking will never match the Indian casteist thinking. Because in European countries a person can work hard defy his status. But in a casteist society people will always find a way to keep there superiority. You a don't have money but you have caste this makes you superior because you are born with the caste. This gives you reason to look down on those who have money and also those who don't have money.

This casteist mentality should go. Today the mentality is to look down at Muslims as the lowest amongst the society. Very soon this will come to haunt you liberals as well. I believe it's the lack of knowledge about a religion not the religion itself which has divided humanity. from what i believe  religion actually tells you how to actually be a good person

for example: respecting your elders ,teachers,your loved ones.

well according to the bhagavad gita krishna is the universe and when krishna gave the divine eyes to arjuna .what he observed that there were infinite forms of krishna indicating that the universe is expanding ( which is true according to the astronomer edwin hubble).

now in terms of living in the society; Religion also tells about different characteristics of a human being-

1. mode of goodness
2. mode of passion

3 mode of ignorance

now following religion also gives you inner piece (eg; chanting ""ohm"" brings inner piece in yourself   and makes you feel more connected and relaxed).

you would actually understand this when you through some books about religion

but yea there are some negative aspects too and i am totally against that (eg: committing fraud and making money through religion). Saying 'Fuck all religion' on Reddit is like saying 'Nazis suck' to a Jew ( or well, anyone with a brain because Nazis do suck, period.)

But you get my point. It's basically preaching to the choir.

Personally, I am spiritual. Not sure if religious but definitely spiritual. I have seen the capacity of religion and spirituality to do good. Yes, a lot of people-in-power use it for their own personal ends and many corrupt their original teachings but that doesn't negate the numerous truly good religious people in the world.

Faith is a fickle thing. It truly gives some people purpose. And I'm not referring to the ones who corrupt it and use it for violence, no. I'm talking about normal, everyday people who wish to go about their lives being decent human beings.

No religion, by itself, promotes violence, murder or hurting your fellow man ( as far as I am aware). It's a tool that was intended to keep people from turning bad. And tools can be used for both good and bad.

Saying 'Fuck all Religion' is easy to say to an Atheist-majority community. The same way it's easy to say 'Fuck all Hindus' to a group of Islamic extremists or 'Fuck all Muslim' to a group og Hindutva extremists. It's just a different form of hate.

What is hard is actually looking into what various religions offer people and why they resonate with people the way they do and maybe then enter into discourse and understanding. I know u r saying this as u r watching what's happening in our country. When it comes to religion, people of power deceive and manipulate the general public to continue enjoying power. Look at the positive side of religion. I was brought up in a family where my parents r atheists and follow Marxism (As Marx said Religion is the opium of the masses; I agree with the statement) but I became a theist.
Every religion is based on some common values giving up materialism, power, greed and rest everyone knows.
Religion may play a big role in the current conditions of our country but u know anyone who truly understands any religion will give up their worldly lives. There r many cases in atheists have been the cause of genocide, take examples of Lenin and Mao. This is not a matter of religion, religion is just instrumental and a tool for these political goons to unite muscle power towards other particular minorities.
If there is no religion and God specifically we r left behind with the Existential question why r we here?, and any sane mind will never believe we r random product of our universe and the universe cant come into existence from nothing. I have studied years of science and philosophy.

Ultimately if there is no God our existence is meaningless and everything we do is meaningless and the Greatest of humans who gave lives for our country all r meaningless (and I don't think u think so). 
Therefore don't look at the surface and judge things go deeper. 
As Einstein said ""Atoms r easier to break than Prejudices"".

Another one Lol As an indian I’m surprised that India is going through this extremism. We have a booming economy and a booming middle class. That’s supposed to bring the extremism down but the opposite is happening. 

I would also like to say that while you may disagree or hate what’s happening. You have to show that disagreement with respect. Don’t abuse people’s choices and faith. Like someone smart once said. “If there wasn’t a god, we’d have to invent one.” Some people have god and nothing else. If you disagree with religion that's fine, but no need to attack religion like that. Your dumbass is like 100 years late [deleted] Only 2 religions made the chaos on this planet. Fuck Buddhism.  Buddhism is installed by chinese emperors in mongolia to control mongolian population and it did worked in 1910s 50% of mongolian mens were monk who can't marry or have sex/kids and most 50% population had HIV related disease caused by chinese merchants. To say you know nothing happens after death is just as crazy to say you know what happens. I disagree heavily. People can believe what they want to believe. My religion plays an important part in me being a better person, and so do others. We coexist, and that’s okay. Why are you being rude and disrespectful? Religion may divide but it also brings us together. For example, the DL and the pope prayed together. Religion brings peace and order, and if you don’t want to believe in it, that’s your choice. But you have no right to disrespect others for believing in it. If religions are only man made, then all of the ills that you are highlighting are likewise man made. 

It isn’t religions that are the problem, because they don’t exist without *people*. So sensitive, take the tampon out your ass No one asked. How dare you insult many people for engaging in a culture that is important to them? As a someone who studies religion I find it disgusting that you pour all this hate onto peoples heritage and cultures. 

It is true that religion can cause issues, and that some people do heinous crimes whilst claiming to be religous. But you cannot defame all religious people for the acts of the few.

There are atheists who have raped and killed but i would not say that all atheists are rapists and killers. I respect atheism just as I respect theism, you should too. No one fucking cares about your shitty opinion. Why do the atheist say “Lord have mercy” in times of distress? Hey look - someone on Reddit thinks they are smarter than almost everyone who has lived on the globe throughout history and, because it is a simplistic criticism of religion, Reddit upvotes it to the moon.

Must be Wednesday. No, you are wrong. The very action of believing something is real can make it real if you really think about it. Why do you have a problem with what is true to others and false for you? Thinking that your beliefs are true are fair but only for you. Yes there are many bad aspects to religions but they also act as great moral guidelines for people. I grew up Christian but never took anything literal like Noah’s ark. I am STILL glad for what I learned though, because it taught love a compassion towards other human beings. You aren’t wrong or right, but you cannot force you narcissistic black nothingness when you die view on others, just like they cannot force their religion on you. Agnostic here. I don't personally believe in God but I'm open to the idea that there might be something after death...unlike athiests who out right deny all religion.

There's no evidence to suggest that an afterlife exists, but there's also no evidence that it doesn't.

&#x200B;

I know plenty of people who are sick, ill, broken individuals barely keeping their lives together and the idea of an afterlife or higher presence puts them at ease. Going to church and being part of a community of people helps with their mental health and gives them the support they need sometimes. I know plenty of churches who have pastors that go out of their way to help poor families and people physically ill or hurt emotionally, suicidal folks and such. When I was a kid our house in Florida got wrecked by hurricane Andrew and the church came out and helped repaired it, even gave us food.

&#x200B;

You don't believe in God? That's fine, neither do I. However don't be an ass about it and attack people who do, it's childish and just plain discrimination. It makes you no better than a homophobe who lashes out at someone for their sexual preferences. Ok, cool. But mind your business and I'll mind mine. Thanks bro. First off you are very aggressive I can’t really even understand your point when it sounds like your yelling with how you wrote second off yes some religions aren’t helpful some are bad but then there are some that are good even if they may not be true there are other benefits to the people apart of the faith and yes maybe not all religions are without blood on their hands but that is very subjective, Christians have killed people yes but not all branches of Christianity were involved. Times are different no big religion (except Islam) seeks to kill people or hurt them there are many benefits the followers get, it gives them something to believe in and it helps them emotionally mentally and physically with that belief, maybe next time don’t be so aggressive 
(I am an orthodox Christian) Hinduism is not a religion. Its a civilization. Religion is a concept alien to India.

Civilization is something that evolves over time. Our scriptures were written by thousands of people over thousands of years. Parts of our scriptures become outdated with time and new ones were written. We accept that somethings in our scriptures were wrong. 

This means Hinduism is very robust and it is the only one to have  survived the test of time. It is cherished. You spelt steel wrong. *than Yeah fuck people that use religion to keep a positive outlook on life. Such a horrible thing.  Good thing you're on Reddit to tell everyone how bad religion is. Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]? [52:35]


Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain. [52:36]


I encourage you people to read Qur'an, most of people have not read it even lot of muslims, for it is indeed from God Almighty. There were books and scriptures from God before Qur'an but they were altered and changes were made by people over time, but Qur'an is same as it was when it was revealed approximately more than 1440 years ago. May Allah guide us towards the right path. Religion is not a harmless belief, I’m not even convinced that such a thing even exists.  For even if you somehow removed religion from all the witch hunts, inquisitions, holy wars, and so on it still comes with false beliefs.  

False beliefs that teaches that we are born broken beings in need of redemption from god, that we can’t possibly reason without god, that we can’t have a functioning morality without a god, that there’s an in group and an out group and we don’t want to be part of the out group, that we’re somehow at the center of the universe, that we’re better than all of the other created beings, and an infinite number of equally inane and false beliefs besides.

What part of this is in any way harmless? What a bunch of crap. Yeah I lose respect immediately for religious people because clearly you can’t take important issues seriously enough to give it critical thought. And fuck you too! Nobody cares about your miserable experience. Lmfao, edgy as fuck Can’t speak for the other religions but you clearly know dick about Hinduism. While I agree with the point this post is trying to make, I can only counter with this thought:

Religion is there to help the weak feel important. To help the lost find direction. It is not something that I have ever needed, but I understand that some people just can't accept reality. Do I pity them? Sure. But mostly I feel bad for all the kids that get force-fed this stuff for their formative years only to have any semblance of choice removed entirely. I overheard a few religious zealots in Chipotle the other day talking about how they tend to lose some of the kids when they get to about 6th grade as they start to question the teachings, and that they really needed to double down on their efforts to lock down ""harmful free-thinking"" prior to that time in their lives to better increase their chances of extracting tithing from them as they got older. Kinda gross, if I'm honest.

Don't really know where I was going with this comment but here we are. More like fuck Islam. Hinduism is mystic and ethereal with useful yogic methods and philosophy. 

Islam is just a political collectivist cult masked ad religion. Literally nobody asked for your hateful opinion; atheists like you who shit on religion and other beliefs like this actually make me embarrassed to be unreligious.

I wish you knew that religion provides moral and emotional support for those that actually need it. It brings meaning into their lives and keeps them happy. I’ve seen atheists become MUCH better individuals after converting. It’s not just about believing in a God. It’s also about self-improvement.

You’re shitting on it because you think you’re an intellectual superior. You’re not; I guarantee you if you act like this in real life no one is going to like you. 

Actually fucking cringe. I couldn't care less about God and I'm not discussing whether he exists or not. So, what i wanted to say is, the problem is not religion. The problem is within the human nature. Most people are nice and decent because they fear Hell, want a reward after death, or simply fear  getting put in jail. Remove these fears, and all these civilized people will eat each other. Imagine religion doesn't exist. One day, the government makes a public statement that within the next 12 hours, everything is legal. Murder, rape, theft, you name it. What do you think the streets will look like then ? No one cares you are not better than everyone else. Get off you reddit high horse and go back to r/atheism where you belong. Here's the problem with everything you've had to say. Although you don't want to believe in a god, that. doesn't mean you're gonna force atheism on everyone else now. Take Sikhism for example, everything isn't about believing in god, a large majority of the religion just teaches you about respect, honesty, integrity, empathy, and many other characteristics you should have anyways. Your approach is really bad, be an atheist if you want, but that doesn't mean you're going to force it down everyone else's throat. Stopped reading halfway through. I’m not religious or a believer either but I don’t scream at people about it. Nobody has the answers. Fuck atheists. Fuck their arrogant, narcissistic viewpoint that they know what happens after death, an experience they've never had. Fuck their need to embellish their superiority for ""knowing the truth""

Hard to ever convince someone to change with extreme sentiment like that isn't it? Hard to actually strike up a conversation with such extreme views isn't it? 

Truth be told no one knows for sure what happens to you when you die. It's why religion exists, to give people peace of mind over something we have troubles even comprehending or knowing as the experience itself is usually permanent. Some people believe we are nothing more than flesh and blood, spawned here to do nothing but reproduce, pass on our traits, and die. Others believe we are more than just meatsacks and that there is a purpose to all this. Religion at least shows some openness to the idea of spirituality, or at least a willingness to think about and discuss it. Why is that such a bad thing? I ONLY LOVE ALLAH NO OTHER RELIGION, I AM ALLAHIST  First humans didn’t come from Africa mate Buddhism is a teaching not a religion. He was a man, not a god. Do not judge that which you do not understand. You missed an important word .. Fuck all ORGANIZED religion. Just because people us religion as an excuse doesn’t mean the religion is causing those terrible things. Evil people will do evil way whether they have a religion or not. Wow so edgy and deep Atheism is a religion, so fuck atheism as well Fuck you nigga The cringe is real. ye and i will fuck you and your stinky indian mother XD ""This ONE fairy tale, this one is real."" Is how I feel about religious people. well fuck u too bitch This is the edgiest post I've ever seen. Fuck you asshole stupid indian Cocaine is fun but you need to cut back some Fuck you This guy has clearly never done dmt. He also speaks like he knows anything. You dont know anything and your claims as to what happens after you die are unfounded, ignorant, and unresearched. Fuck you, you know it all pseudointellectual twat. Also, inversely I love you and your teenage mind. You're ignorant to believe that. You know how fucking insane it is that's we're even here right now? You know what's more unbelievable than an afterlife? Fucking LIFE. THIS LIFE. You don't know shit, I don't know shit, nobody knows shit except for the ones who have died. Best not to go around being a piece of shit if you can't ACTUALLY back any aspect of your argument up. STFU stupid ass!! Looks at atheist north korea, soviet union, china.... well that did not go well. Cringe You know all these so called facts are merely hypothesis. I know that I for one am genetically a descendant of Neanderthal who were in Europe for at least a couple million years. And those same people had already discovered fire.... In fact research shows that homo erectus could use fire. Cringe bro, all the shit you said is such uneducated garbage, I actually started to believe you were going to make a point that made sense somewhere. It's due to fear of the uncontrollable. Every single human wants to have control over every aspect of their lives, so that they can prevent bad things from ever happening to their loved ones.

The idea that bad things can happen to them, for no fault of their own, with no way to control or prevent it is terrifying to people.

So terrifying that they'll rather believe anything else - including fictional omnipotent beings (god), fictional omnipotent forces (reiki, vaastu, feng shui etc.), karma, multiple lives, rebirth etc.

It's a widespread, unacknowledged mental health problem. All of these people have severe anxiety and fear, and need counseling/therapy. Wow you’re so edgy You’re not an atheist. Your religion is shitting on streets. Well, angry... In all honesty it's great to have an opinion. Although, religion itself has caused nothing, It's used to justify why people murder, otherwise it would have been over other reasons like land, money or power. As long as there are bad people, acts of hate and crime will forever exist. Some people need a beleif in a higher power to help justify a reason to be good, a reason not to murder or steal.

Thank you for reading my crappy comment and have a fantastic day! Wouldn't accept such an emotional speech. Religious people can use emotions againt you too. So much ignorance in one post and the comments below. God (or whatever) save the future of this planet with such wannabe fools. > You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe.

That's literally a part of Buddhism. You can't just lump all religions together because a couple of them piss you off.

I don't disagree with you. I just can't agree with you either. Who cares, fuck you [deleted] So , to anyone reading this one out of thousands of comments . Hey ! I would like to tell you that you matter . Never let stuff get in your head . Your faith is yours , you have the right to practise ,profess and propagate it . Religion is a concept that helps cope millions in their time of desperation and about the blood . People have killed each other over food , do you stop eating it totally ? No , because its a savage (man this word has lost meaning nowadays) humans instinct to kill . And they will believe in any bullsh*t reason to do so . sheesh, op is trying to compensate for a super small dick here so hard it's funny I agree 💯% with you.But here's a little known fact: There was no such thing as religion in the Indian culture. You see, there's no such word as ""Religion"" or ""The God"" in Sanskrit. Hinduism isn't a religion, it's a culture. What’s in it for you? Let people live how they want, no one need to listen to your sorry ass So do you happen to have an explanation of how such a complex universe came into being or do you happen to believe the theory of random reactions causing this? Although it is the most plausible theory for scientists but it doesnt make sense at all to anyone who isn't desperate to find a reason that proves that god is a lie. The way you speak is how a suicidal or depressed person speaks, perhaps it's time you should see someone for it. What did Buddhism do? Pretty sure that whole thing is just based on “This dude chilled so hard once that he he ran out of fucks to give” Jesus fuck, who pissed in your cereal #FUCK U TOO how people are free to type long messeges 😂 I don't agree.

Until today I will never understand why people cannot live and let live because everybody is allowed to believe in what they want and also to practice what they want.

Religions have a personal meaning for every human being and this should be accepted because it is also okay if you think that there is no God and you just want to talk yourself into believing that there is no God. This is also your own opinion which you should keep for yourself and not try to convince everyone as the right one. Although what seems to be right for you doesn't have to be so for the other person. In my opinion a religion serves the people not only to form something beautiful after death - there is much more to it. If you believe there is no God then you feel this personally and you don't have to shout that all this is stupid and nonsense.

I myself am religious, but I also accept people who do not think that way, several people should do it slowly and understand and not rush against everyone. How do you know all this? What’s so bad about having faith? You just look depressed af. There’s no need to knock anyone because they choose to believe in something based on faith. It’s not like religion is the only thing that has caused war in the past. In the past, humans found whatever reason they could to kill each other, the world is undeniably more civilized than it was hundreds of years ago. Nothing is perfect buddy, religion is not perfect. Science is not perfect. Just let people believe what they want to believe and maybe there would be less polarization and less violence in the world, how about that? This smells like a copypasta. Keep calm and carry on. No one would fuck with you for being an atheist in India. But a Muslim friend from India told me, abusing Islam would definitely get you killed. Okay, I think we can have interesting talk here. I know the bible very good, and I AGREE with the complaints you have against what the other religions are teaching about.

Death

 For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all, nor do they have any more reward, because all memory of them is forgotten.  Also,  their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, and  they no longer have any share in what is done under the sun.

  Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might, for there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave, where you are going.  

## Ecclesiastes 9:5,6,10

**Reincarnation Phenomena Explained**

ONE of the objections to the theory  of reincarnation is that the vast majority of people on earth have no  recollection at all of having lived before. Furthermore, they do not  even think that they could have lived earlier lives

Hell

 The Hebrew word *Sheol,* which referred to the “abode of the  dead,” is translated “hell” in some versions of the Bible. What does  this passage reveal about the condition of the dead? Do they suffer in  Sheol in order to atone for their errors? No, for they “know nothing.”  That is why the patriarch Job, when suffering terribly because of a  severe illness, begged God: “Protect me in hell \[Hebrew, *Sheol*\].”Job 14:13; *Douay-Rheims Version*)  What meaning would his request have had if Sheol was a place of eternal  torment? Hell, in the Biblical sense, is simply the common grave of  mankind, where all activity has ceased.

 **The Little Flock**

 Who,  then, make up this little flock having such a wonderful prospect? The  followers of Jesus Christ who receive an anointing with holy spirit. (Acts 2:1-4)  Seeing them as heavenly singers with harps in their hands, the apostle  John wrote: “I saw, and, look! the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion,  and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his name and the  name of his Father written on their foreheads. These are the ones that  did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins. These  are the ones that keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes. These  were bought from among mankind as first fruits to God and to the Lamb,  and no falsehood was found in their mouths; they are without blemish.”​—Revelation 14:1,4,5

Great Crowd

  What does John see? “A great crowd, which no man was able to number, out  of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the  throne and before the Lamb.” **(Read Revelation 7:9-14 We have seen the gathering of millions whose hope is to live on the earth forever.\` God's original plan for mankind**

Religion and War

  Christians  are not authorized to fight against their enemies. The apostle Paul  wrote to fellow Christians: “If possible, as far as it depends on you,  be peaceable with all men. Do not avenge yourselves.”​—Romans 12:18,19

Instead  of sending his followers to war, Jesus told them: “Continue to love  your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you, so that you may  prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens.” (Matthew 5:44,45) Even when the nation in which they live goes to war, Christians should remain neutral, “no part of the world.” (John 15:19)  If God wants his worshipers in all nations to love their enemies and  to remain separate from the world, how could he support either side of a  violent conflict today?

Free Will

 God also gave us the mental abilities, such as the powers of perception,  reason, and judgment, that work in harmony with free will. These enable  us to think, weigh matters, make decisions, and distinguish right from  wrong. Hebrews 5:14)  We were not created to be like mindless robots that have no will of  their own; nor were we created to act primarily out of instinct, as were  the animals.

 Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are going in through it; [ ](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070144/23446)whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it. Matthew 7:13,14

This is why we are different than most because we are on the Narrow road.

. >We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion

220,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki would beg to differ, only if they were alive. What is this hateful trash Hurr Hurr im a edgy atheist hurr hurr. Fuck off. I dont believe in any religions. However, I dont think we can simple say that all religions are bad, the world would be a better place without it.

Bad thing happened with or without religions.

Religions are something happened in human history, fit for the time when they was created,  with their own value and limitation.

They are still alive now, which means their historical misson are not finished. The time has not come. Accept it. Religion without science is blind
Science without religion is lame - Albert Einstein.

Just my two cents. If you cant prove that God exists, you certainly can't prove he doesn't. 

Atheism is in fact a faith. A faith that there's no God.
And sure some really bad things are done in the name of religion, but some very very bad things that happened were irrespective of religion. WW2 for instance, or Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
Downvote if you want, but this is reality and there are a few true atheists, majority are just sheeps following what's cool and after the idea their actions have no consequences. What so ever. Watch what your hatred has turned you into, the exact thing you hated. And I obviously speak only philosophically. The only difference between them and you is that you hate just one more religion than them. If I were to extrapolate your being into a more agressive and affirmative one, you'd be with them with your guns and shooting them both. 
Belief and disbelief are equally harmful. It's not the belief in their god(s) that makes people kill in the name of religion but the disbelief in other's. 

I'm disappointed in you. Fuck ALL religions?

Oh how egalitarian of you.

Ok enlightened centrist.


Edit: please continue to downvote me while awarding centrists. Keep doing that. That's why we are here and why we will stay here for a long time. Even if we get out we will eventually come back to this place. Good work. Nope. Violent people will be violent regardless of religion. There's no shortage of violence committed in the name of atheism either (communists etc). Definitely should be here r/unpopularopinion Religion solves real problems, traditions are smart solutions to old forgotten problems, idk I’m from America so it’s easy to say this, but this is one of the least “speak truth to power” things you can say, you’re on reddit after all, the utter home of atheism. Dude, don't apply the same label of Sanatan Dharm on other ideologies. Or, rather, specifically, Buddhism. Yes, I'm a Buddhist and I claim that you clearly haven't read anything about Buddhism to be whining and shaming the ideology in this manner. And no, Buddhism is not a religion. It's just an ideology. And no, I don't give a penny's fuck about what Wiki says, what Dictionary says. As someone who has been following Buddhism for her entire life, allow me to inform you that it is not a religion. Keep your stupidity away from its name. my sympathies Anyone who thinks religion is made up be it any I am talking about the concept of God or a maker here explain what's 0+0 ?? 🤗😂🤦🏽‍♀️ Yup that's what I thought I entirely agree with you however the deeper question is not what is after death. It is why the universe is here and how/why it was formed. I agree crediting a god for the phenomenon of existence is low effort. Science will ultimately work hard give us concrete forms of an answer. However from a philosophical point of view there are certain questions which will likely always remain unanswered. If time is a construct of the universe being in its current state, what is the universe's true form and can we know it? Where did it come from? Why? These trouble people and I agree that religion takes the mind away from the question and life. Your post was so well written and I hope you'll enjoy this point as well.

^(I want be explicitly clear that I am not referring to question of why an given human is here but rather the universe ) It's clear OP follows Judaism. He didn't mention it. I think I saw this same rant in Ready Player One. I understand that you're pissed, I am too. But blaming what happened or whatever bad happens is like blaming Biology for Coronavirus. 
I don't know if you go to college, office, school, etc, but people of different cultures, religions, regions, etc work/study together. You don't normally see them killing each other over religion. Why do riots happen? Who participates in riots? First analyse the situation, people involved, people who started it or provoked it. 
Look I could have taken offense when you wrote ""F* Islam"", but I didn't because I know that you're pissed and me giving you the finger on the internet is childish. Religious extremism is really bad because it distracts you from the actual religion that you're following. Extremism teaches you exactly the opposite what the message religion wants to convey. It would be more appropriate if you abused ISIS. 
Those people who think that by killing people of other religion is okay will be acceptable by God, they couldn't be more wrong. They will be punished. Everyone's time will come.

I see many comments here who are against religion and calling it a scam. Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong, but I'll say this, you go your way, I'll go my way, whenever we will meet, I'll greet you with a smile.

Jai Hind. op are you okay ? Lol, another angsty teen. How do you know there is no god? Your hate in religion is a religion in itself. Cool your jets bro. You are probably at the lowest part of the social triangle, and you probably deserve it would you look at that ! baby's atheism phase Dumbass energy flows, and time only grows. It would be kinda stupid if there is nothing after life, so all this shit you wrote is nonsense A higher power exists Atheists and misled orthodox are both toxic to the truth if you ask me Brother, I’m a muslim, i may be corrupt but my religion is not! Please stop taking wrong people as the ambassador of any religion. There are good people in all religions! Lmao at the atheist cope. Buddhism is not a religion. Look know angry you are! You realize that atheism is a belief structure in itself, right? 

I used to be constantly amazed with evangelical atheists until I realized this. Lol so you know there is no god. What a fucking joke. What did Christian ever do to you? May Allah have mercy on you. This is clearly coming from someone who is mad all the time and has a sad life. Nothing to see here Fuck Hinduism Hinduism is not a religion Stupid hindu piece of shit with your bullshit rhetoric of hate. You're not any better than these hindu nationalists for thinking exactly like them ""fuck islam"" is the root cause of hate in this shithole country and you come to reddit to preach this. Have some common decency you fucktard As a Muslim reading about what is happening to Muslims in Idia right now, you really want me to believe we are the bad ones? Or I could point out the genocide happening to us in China or the countries taking turns bombing the crap out of the middle east.

But none of that would compare to the evidence that the Quran has to offer about the perfection of Islam. Haters gonna hate. Isn’t science technically a religion? May God open your hearts. “They all just want to believe in something good after death.” 

I think you’re forgetting about the most terrifying prospect imaginable - an eternity of torment separated from God and the possibility of relief from suffering. I suppose many religious believers begin their spiritual journey preferring total annihilation after death to a belief system like Christianity that allows for such a horrific potentially.

The fact of the matter is that you know that God exists. You simply do not wish to accept him on his terms. You want your sin more than the truth, so you rage against God and all who follow him (however imperfectly) hoping you find comfort in likeminded individuals, of which you’ll find plenty on reddit.

That said, we’re all sinners in need of forgiveness, and it’s never too late for a living person to ask Jesus Christ to open their eyes to the truth of his gospel. There is a way to escape God’s judgment, and it is in the person of his son, Jesus Christ, who lived the perfect life you and I could not, went to the cross and died as a substitute sufferer of God’s wrath that you and I deserve, and who rose from the dead, having satisfied God’s wrath against the sin of all who put their faith in him and submit to him as Lord. It’s only then that a person can expect “something good after death.” Fuck atheism. Fuck all of those who do not believe the truth. Jesus Christ died For you too, but you refuse to believe it. You See the truth but you decide to ignore.

Also the reason for most of the wars that were because of religion actually weren't. Most of em came to be because of resources. Religion was nothing but a made up reason. Human is a greedy being

Atheism is evil. Religion is good. But why do you care so much, couldn’t u mind ur own business and just let people live Religion is a belief... as is Atheism. \>  Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension.  

Nope, fuck off. Crazy bastard. Cringe You mad, bro? > Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so

Hey Atheist hypocrites, how about take your own advice. 

> You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But matter itself is being part of this universe.

And stop acting like life matters. Stop complaining about suffering if none of this shit matters. Lolololol

For us life matters and the kind of life we live matters because that’s the ideology we believe in. You tell us it’s all man made. Ok let’s say we believe you. Now tell us exactly how you can objectively prove with evidence that life matters and all of your bitching about suffering isn’t just an emotional and subjective rant. Prove to us with evidence that your morality itself isn’t a product of your surrounding and the times we are living in i.e man made. 

It’s quite telling for a movement to claim rationality by appealing to people’s emotions. How does that work exactly, you know because emotions are biased and subjective. You can't exactly use them to prove or disprove anything. Lol soyboi is mad How about no? Fuck aww wewigion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Iswam, fuck Chwistian, fuck Buddhism.

I don't agree with people calling for religion to be eradicated though because it generates belief and people in times of need and desperation need something like that to latch on to for hope Pro-Atheist trying to convert Religious people into Atheist is same thing .   
What you can do is never bring religion into governance , Keep it at your home .   


Government job is welfare of all people that's it . The main issue is identity politics. How Avicenna ‘prove’ God/Allah/Bhagwan exists

“The full argument is a bit complicated, but here is a somewhat simplified version. Avicenna’s proof actually has nothing to do with design, he doesn’t need the idea that the universe is intelligently put together. Instead, he argues from the idea that the things we see around us are ‘contingent’ or merely ‘possible’.

“The idea here is that a contingent thing is something that may either exist or not exist; its nature does not guarantee that it exists. What Avicenna wants to do is show you that although all the things we experience directly are indeed contingent, there is also something else that exists necessarily, in other words, whose very nature guarantees that it exists.


“To do this, Avicenna points out that since a contingent thing on its own merit could either exist or not exist, it must have some external cause that made it exist - like ‘tipping the scales’ in favor of its existence rather than its non-existence.


“So take me, for instance. I am contingent, meaning that I am the sort of thing that could easily have failed to exist. In fact, at one time I didn’t yet exist, and in the future I will cease existing, that proves I’m not necessary.

“So there must have been a cause, maybe my parents, who brought me into existence. Now Avicenna observes that the aggregate whole of all contingent things – in other words the physical universe – is also contingent. After all, everything in the universe is contingent, so taken all together as one thing, it too must be contingent. Thus it also needs an external cause, just like I do.

“Since that external cause has to be outside the whole aggregate of contingent things, it cannot itself be contingent. So it is necessary. Hey presto, we’ve proven that there is a necessary existent which causes all other things! And this, of course, is God. I think there is a place for religion in our world. However, we are humans first, a brother/sisterhood, a country, a species and all the way at the bottom of the ladder of relevant quantifiers do we find religion. You want to curse organized religion.  The construct of personal religion ( or god for that matter) helps a lot of people get through life. It’s a framework for them to rest their unrest due to the unexplained. 
It’s almost like people never took the science fiction books ( the religious decrees) with a grain of salt.
Then somewhere in the history of time, the organizers solidified their positions and it’s been a shitshow since then
Edit: I personally don’t give a shit about any god. It’s pretty fucking rational and clear to me. The things which I cannot explain are the gaps in humanity’s ability to understand. Doesn’t mean there’s an invisible god out there Is this a copypasta r/copypasta Fuck athiest too /r/justneckbeardthings Dude chill The big bang started out of nothing by nothing, makes sense U really wrote all of this to promote a subreddit 🤦 Who cares ? People have different tastes. You need to chill... Christians saved your country from islam. Might want to show a little gratitude. [removed] That how China survived over 5000 years. Religion is a believe, not a social norms. preaching to the choir buddy Seems strange to me anything exists in the first place, it's just a bit wack. Even with our understanding it doesn't make sense so I like to think theirs a higher power at play, I don't tell people their going to hell or anything like that, I just  like to believe in what I do, i mean if I'm wrong it not like anything bad comes of that, religion has started   to make me a better person so it's not all bad r/copypasta material maybe God is real and there’s proof, sorry I can’t just do what you say and believe when there is tons of proof to the contrary. Go back to r/atheism you cheeto dusted edgelord [removed] Ohh wow a cool progressive person bashing the religion, wow claps claps. So what did religion give you ask? Ohh you dont even ask you just bashed it, again super cool but in the spirit of debating it in unbiased(lol does it exist in debates?) manner let me speak against the motion:

*  **Meaning to Life/Things**: While in todays world it must be irrelevant to most of us but in the past when reddit did not exist and they did not have u/pking3 to guide them through the mysteries of world ,What gave their life a meaning ? What explained unexplainable world to them? What calmed their curiosities , what prevented them from going madand just live like a hunter gatherer always without any other purpose in their life?  
*Downside*: *While it soothed the basic nature of humanity to question things and move forward to other things, it arguably might have might slowed down the development*, but slow and steady wins the race, it was more important that they identify themselves different from animals rather than estabilishing error or noise corrections in the quantum computing and harvesting its quantum entanglement property. Remember how you are first told that sun rises in east in 1st class rather than how the combined result of rotation at tilted axis and revolution of earth around earth gives you days and seasons. I bet you still dont know basic science of why seasons exist, but that is not the point yes sorry.
* **Identity:** Next is giving them an identity, it was required to provide more stability to their life. What provided trust among two random beings at that time? *""Ohh hey bro! I see you are from Meet nagar in Shahdara as well which is thousands of years yet to be, me too, lets grab some beer*"". Trustng each other was the first step towards to give rise to settlements and what promotes trust faster than having same school of thoughts   
 *""Hey bro I worship nature""*  
 *""Ahh i see you are a man of culture as well, join in! Loot us later we are yet to have NRC to ascertain your full identity""*  
*Downside: Ohh you understood already, as population grew , clashes grew on whose imaginary friend was better at protecting them while they died more because of him/them.*
* **Development:**  While necessity is the mother of inventions, who is the mother of necessities? Yes! The competitions, the wars.   
*""Bro i am oldest religion, we have paper manuscrpits and shiz""*  
*""But do you have weaponised stones bro?""*  
*""Bro now we do""*  
*""But but do you have metals and shiz bro?""*  
*""Bro now we do""*  
*""Bro do you have RDX and ammunitions bro? ""*  
*""Bro now we do but bro do you have papers now?""* ..... Only change is it is no longer for religion but for region now. Religionism gave rise to crusades and we had wars anyways without religion reasons as well. Wars are terrible, but they put science on warp speeds.  
*It took 1900 years to find electron in the atom but 50 years to perfect it to ruin the prefectures with Nucleur bomb.*  
*Again it took 1900 years to make the first flying thingy and just 10 years afterwards to make it fight worthy in WW1, or 50 years to reach moon.* and many other examples  
Religion gave rise to groupism which gave rise to competitions which gave rise to development.   
*Downside: No need to repeat*
* **Moral Policing/Accountability:** While cinema is witness that no one left someone ""*Bhagwaan ke liye*"". But then what have made masses to conduct themselves in order within themselves? Who did they fear before our hero u/pking3 came here to spread truth. Somewhere in sometime BC  
*""Bro no one pleez steal it behind me""*  
*""Why bro wathcu guna do""*  
*""Well I have 24 x7 CCTV surveillance, and i will submit it as proof to Police/CRPF to whoever necessary and they will punish you accordingly""*  
*""Huh?""*  
*""I meant God bro, god is all watching and all just""........*  
*Downside: Moral Compass seemed to break during wars with others, this is not a fault of religion though but the followers. No religion asks you to wage war unnecessarily ( i want my comment to stay and not get removed)*
* **Teaching How to Live:** Religion gave us a sense of wrongs and rights, dos and donts. While most of it helped,  few are useless in todays world yes. It prevented human beings from going back to uncivilised culture. Spread harmony ( atleast within the religion) . Gave people a space to grow. Defined a set of rules of conduct, became the parent to parentless, teacher to teacherless.   
*Downside: Regressive rules, few wrong teachings or wrong interpretations.*

There are more reasons but 5 points suffice.  I tried to stay away from religion while pointing these. I agree there is a lot of hate between people now but then Development/ Science can only come after religion whenever Earth is restarted. Fact that you can rant about it now is beacause it helped you and your civilisation to reach this place in the first. It is not all harmful the same way as Science is not all useful. Make everyone atheist and you will see people forming religion again because until Science explains everything, religion will exist. Religion is not religion it is snyonym of hope and beta ""Ummeed pe Duniya Kayam hai"" Wait til you find out why you're just mad, and there is spirituality out there that isn't toxic. You dont really know what happens after death same as religious people. 

Religious folks and atheists are two sides of the same coin as far as I'm concerned. This kind of cringe ngl Yes, a world full of atheists will be truly perfect... LOL. Humans will be humans regardless of faith. Either do something good for the planet or stand out of the way of people that are. Hinduism is not a religion. Your argument is invalid BTW atheists have their own “religion”... Get a grip dude! Seriously, some therapy, a glass of wine maybe? Some weed??? I dunno????

Hello all, My sister got a 49,000 rank in JEE Mains with Delhi domicile. She has got MAE in IGDTU till Round 1, but hasn't been upgraded till Round 3. Our options below in order of choice filling - 

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process & Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical & Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical & Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production & Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either. 

Q1. Should I move DTU branches above MAE from IGDTU?

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

Q3. I have read some post on quora stating that NSUT is better for circuit branches, and DTU is better for rest. How true is that? 

Q4. Is ECE at IGDTU good enough? (if she gets it in further rounds)

Kindly suggest edits to the above order.

Please share your experience.


Edit: This post is just sad as hell.",OnidaKYGel," I lost my father exactly 1 year ago yesterday. Although he was a diabetic but there was never a complication. Then suddenly he suffered a heart stroke and that was it. I unfortunately wasn’t with him in his last moments. 

I had always practiced this event in my mind that one day he won’t be there. But when you hear this news you don’t seem to comprehend it. Nothing makes sense to you at all. All the plans you had made are now gone. You had planned for a surprise family holiday? It’s gone. You wanted to discuss some random stuff with him? Not possible. You wanted to buy him a new tool kit? Not possible. 

The initial 2-3 months are the worst while your mind rewrites or reroutes your thoughts to navigate around the void that’s  just been created. Your keep asking yourself what if you had done that or what if you were there etc .

And then gradually time heals everything and you learn to live with his memories. Life goes on. I lost my mom before my 10th grade exams and my dad 3 months ago.... I'm currently writing my final sem exams. It sucks big time especially when you're not expecting someone to just go away suddenly - the case with my dad. 


Both my mom and dad had chronic illnesses, I don't even wanna name what the illnesses were coz they were so bad I wish nobody has to go through what they went through. Hospital and medical expenditure was so high that we couldn't save a penny and as result, right now, my final condition is very pathetic and I have two sisters to take care of. We still don't have our own house we still live in a rented house in 2019, we have no property, no land, nothing. Most of our relatives are scums, they never supported my dad when he was ill and we don't expect anything from them so we like to maintain our distance.


Mentally speaking, I'm depressed, hopeless, shattered. I still am not over my Dad's death. He would have lived had he agreed to go to the hospital earlier so there will always be this guilt with me, I'll always feel like I couldn't save my dad and I have to live with it.


 Speaking of the future, I just don't know what to do now from here. Nothing's going the right way for me. My dream is to crack UPSC civil services exam but UPSC will take time and i don't have time, i have to find a job quick asap after my exams so I'll probably do some odd jobs and give some easier government exams for now and then I'll see what I can do. 


It's like I don't have a purpose for living anymore but I'm trying. Trust me, nothing is worse than losing both your parents. Please spend everyday with your parents like it would be their last so you don't have any regrets like me. Life is cruel and you cannot predict what's going to happen next. Lost my Dad in 2016. I've never been truly happy since then. I always get stressed or mad at even the most silliest thing and it's genuinely ruining my life. Haven't yet managed to think that he's truly gone. :( Depends on what age you lose them, what kind of relation you had, and your own nature.

When you get older and lose them, you get over it faster.  If they were suffering from a major illness, you will be relieved that they are gone.

My startup is a service based IT company. To make good portfolio, I took a seat in a co-working space and immediately started getting business because of my 110% dedication, 'under commit and over deliver' stand and a kinda less profit margin. 
Now comes the problem.

- They are never clear what they want. Everyday a new requirement. 
- Their hand never reach their pockets, never. Never ever!
- They are never satisfied
- They come up with rs.5k budget to make new Flipkart and Amazon

Was in IT service, so no investment other than co-working space monthly billing.
So no loss but almost no profit. 
But i made a huge portfolio and shifted my client base to US, UK and Nordic market.

Perfect people. They know what they want. Give them a date and the payment is in your account. They give what they promise if they bargain (i am not having that much budget but i promise you 5 clients after this project, and the person came up with 5 clients in next 2 months) 
Indians never. They say this and they forget. They don't respect words!


After some time, I thought the time is different, the market is booming, the people have changed. So i took 3 new Indian clients.
Guess what! 
History repeated itself. I have only 3 clients who have not paid the money. Guess who are they?

Tldr,
Indians don't pay money even for the service they have taken! Spitting. Parking cars on turns. Pissing all over the place in western style toilets.  Littering EVERYWHERE.

""xyz industry mein hoon Abc company mein""               
""Aaj kal xyz industry aur chal nhi rhi""

And list goes on and on....
 I don't know if this fits but a person working in a different country is considered far more successful than people staying here and making it big. This might seem snooty.
But our behaviour on Flights.

Fucking Hell , we always ensure that Air Hostess folk have to keep on checking if the seat is upright and window is raised .
Then seatbelts ..
It's not that hard...
Atleast wear it loose when you're on the seat.


Then After Landing , Getting up almost immediately and Opening Overhead Bins.
In all these scenarios ,you're more likely to hurt another person than yourself.
Which is exactly why you keep doing it.


Last but not least, our priorities.
Couple of years ago ,an Emirates Flight from Thiruvananthapuram to Dubai crash landed at the Dubai International Airport.
The Firefighters at the Airport managed to evacuate the Entire Flight in less than 90 seconds.
Even after the Crash Landing , people tried to take their laptops and Hand Baggage.
They opened emergency Exits at this point.

There's a reason why it's open.
Because the Fucking Fuel Tanks might explode.
And in this scenario , it did and resulted in the Death of an Emarati Firefighter.


A lot of Foreign flying crew were repeatedly saying this is the attitude of all Indians.
I'm not one to exactly accept stereotypes but FFS it's so hard to negate the argument.

Recently , I had a fucking similar experience .
Moron opens overhead bin while flight is on the taxiway after landing and bag which has moved falls down luckily hitting the seat and not directly onto a passenger.



This pisses me off every fucking time. Driving habits on the road. Just bought a new car, 2 hours after delivery of car, one auto-wallah brushed it from the rear when the car was at halt at signal. Scratches all over rear bumper. The dirty habit of staring at any and everyone anywhere they go. Indians in the US also do this. Makes me want to punch their face! Peeking into some one else’s phone while travelling via public transport. I swear the number of times I’ve seen people trying to peep into my WhatsApp. And every time I catch them I shove the phone in their face saying “acche se dekhke.” 

Also old uncles playing WhatsApp videos loudly. So fucking annoying. 

Autos stopping smack in the middle of the road when someone hails them down. 

Literally nobody uses an indicator while turning.

Open mouthed gawking. I’m 6’3 tall, have tattoos and a ponytail. I feel like I’m always being watched by at least 10 people at once. 

Neighbours rushing to peep from their door when they hear the sound of the elevator opening on to their floor. 

Standing, walking in the middle of a narrow road blocking vehicles and not budging even after excessive honking. 

 Staring. eating with mouth open or making noise. Burrping [removed] Digging nose in public

And not washing hands after Carrying a speaker with loud noise when u are in public place.
Judging people by their English.
Not following traffic rules( especially not allowing pedestrians to cross the road when the signal is red and bypassing it).
Forget abt Aeroplane commuters, they never heard abt something queue. They are in hurry to receive the Olympic medal for getting down the plane in the fastest time. Politicians and their bootlicking entourage. The entire big shot politician culture where we treat a regular Corporator like an MP. 

Putting up of unnecessary hoardings by unemployed, unproductive youth and also the same youth indulging in making a street pub in the name of festivals by hiring fuckall DJ's to blast fuckall songs and deafen each living being in a 5 km radius. Ogling at woman! Imposing your religious and cultural beliefs on others and judging them when they don't follow it.  Thread padhte hi BP high ho gaya. Need to head out for a walk. Public me thookna. It's so cringey. Asking if there is salt in my toothpaste.. Imma bite yo face, bitch.

 Talking loudly in public. Staring. Long, languorous, staring. Not just roadside romeos but everyone when they encounter something they don't see everyday. You want to walk in my field of vision? Let me escort you through it with my eyes  ""log kya kahenge"" Slurping coffee during meetings.  Lane cutting. Man, seriously the single most absolute worst thing Indians to is change lanes too frequently, especially the autowallahs.  Unsolicited opinions.  Being loud on phone in public and taking long breaks at work.  Indians argue a lot and rarely admit that they are wrong. Man, start saying No dont nod your head for everything  Aggressive self loathing to no positive outcome. I'm also guilty of it. caring more about someone else's job rather than focusing on your own. Not following lane discipline.

Not using blinkers.

Not turning headlights to low beam.

Driving like morons. 

Parking like bigger morons. 

Spitting that awful red paste.

Throwing trash EVERYWHERE.

Smashing coconuts and melons outside temples and not cleaning it up.

No interest in keeping things clean. 

Caste system (which to my surprise is still quite prevelent)

Carving their names (and their SO's) into priceless monuments and war memorials

SPITTING THAT AWFUL RED PASTE. 

.. Honestly I could go on..  Freeloading even when there is no urgency i have pretty bad OCD, i wash my hands every now and then....it boggles me when in my office toilet when people never wash hands after peeing, i am like dude stay away....and i dont know how to tell them to wash hands...and also when people move stuff from my desk, i cry within. :( All of them. No concept of personal space. Chipak jaao. Farting openly in public as if no one notices. Die hard fan of Mudi gyan chodna BKL log jo hath dikha ke road cross Kar dete hai. BC  ABS EBD Brake assist SAB lagana pad Jata h kabhi kabhi. Okay, some people just dont release my hand after a handshake. What's that? Laptop, mobile, headphones suggestion requests on r/india.  This question is most annoying:

One of your relative: My \[relative/ friend/ son/ daughter\] got a job in good company \[MNC\]. Why u r not getting a job even in small company then? Try nahi karte kya?  Grammatical ones 

## What 'Indian' habits do *you* find the most annoying?

&#x200B; Retarded idiots who do social policing, the idiots with stupid petitions against Netflix, Amazon and the kulcha gank Haggling over everything and shitting in the streets Those damn soap operas. They are transmitting a lot of crazy upon people. Treating servants and office peons like shit. And sucking up to superiors. People on two wheelers try to drive through any tiny space they see. Doesn't matter if it a car or a truck. And many times the truck drivers can't see them because they're so close and the driver is sitting so high. And they get run over by the truck. Last night two people (a father and his daughter) died the same way at a road near my home.  Slowpokes driving on the right side of main roads @ 20 kmph in their ₹.100 vehicles. I'm gonna run you over assholes. Paan and gutka. Just stop. Take up smoking please. I can't stand those red stains on walls. [removed] Eat beta eat  the so called ""Democracy"" ""beta engineering/medical karlo uske baad jo maan wo karna"" Life is like two pea's in a pod.  One annoys the other.

We all annoy, natural talent.  This entire post is triggering my anxiety. I need an adult. Honking unnecessarily on roads Talking (actually screaming) on the top of their lungs to converse with each other in restaurants, public places. 


Uncles sharing their daily morning rituals ""Bhai hum to subha uthate hi do glass garam paani peete hain, aur bus pet saaf (they would never say they finish of packs of khaini jarda after that)"" Aunties Gossiping. Lol  Parking. They don't give two shits about how the bike parked ahead comes out if you park yours horizontally. People driving while talking on the phone or while listening music on earphones..  Celebrating mediocrity.  Meddling in other people's business.  My father and his elder brother ask for my friends' ""Caste"" saying ""Kaun Thakur hai""? Using at least 10 emojis in a sentence. 

Always clarifying that they're Indian in social media platforms. Come on bro, there is no big fucking deal in being born in a country with 1.3 billion people. Spitting anywhere! Oh so many, where do I start...

1. Signing at the entrance of apts... I dont know if the register has really ever been reviewed.
2. Full body search at expensive cinemas
3. Asking for self attested photocopies, has the signature helped in prosecuting someone or really ensured you dont get fakes?

&#x200B; People who just complaint and don't do shit Dealing with Mohras. Example, you close a deal with one person. He discusses it with his family. The head honcho insists he revise it. Shows up the next day saying HE wants a revision.

A variant of this habit is found in personal relationships, where intimacy is killed because the spouse or lover makes a third party, usually family, a secret party to all relationship details.

Another variant of this habit is found in romances, where the recieving party instead of building a relationship immediately divulges details to dominating  frands to secure bragging rights, sometimes even bringing them along just to prove to THEM. Adding to the constant honking, people driving with their side view mirrors shut annoy me alot. Also rickshaw and Ola drivers just going top speed moment they see an empty space. As if we entitled to sound horn .",2018-09-20 21:02:23

I'd be using it pretty much ONLY for basic college-work I'm not particularly sharp when it comes to technology. What are some 'must-dos' going forward? 
Also, should I stick with the Windows 10 Home it came with or switch to Pro, or even Linux, probably?",barbiebear69," Windows 10 by default has a lot of unnecessary settings enabled. Turn them off, for example Cortana and Opt In Ads. Also uninstall extra software that ASUS installs by default (a quick Google search will help you see which ones are useful and which ones aren't). Update the PC fairly regularly and use windows defender to scan for malware once in 2 weeks. Download ublock origin, privacy badger and https everywhere from the firefox/chrome store, depending on the browser you use. 

Win 10 Home is fine. If you're getting pro for free might as well as get that since you're getting additional features (which you will most likely never use) for free, but if you have to pay then don't. Install TripMode (get it from TripMode.ch) - it's not free but cheap. Using TripMode you can easily control what programs are allowed to connect to the internet. This can be a huge blessing with Windows 10 that will keep trying to upload all your personal data to Microsoft and / or try to download huge updates. You can simply block all this and run windows update when you want to.

Don't install Chrome as it will just slow down your system - it's a personal data, memory and processor hog. Instead use Firefox or PaleMoon with uBlock Origin extension for blocking ads along with Privacy Badger and DecentralEyes extension.

Yes, install Linux. I recommend [LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition)](https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php) instead of Ubuntu which also slows down systems now a days. Use it the best way you can. Don't worry about OS until it bothers you to a point you need to consider alternatives. Only thing I'd suggest you do is monitor the battery life. Playing games, watching videos will drain your batter faster than, say, browsing reddit or editing text files. Once you settle into a routine, monitor how long your battery lasts. Keep it clean. Keep it updated. Expect to run some software, since you are in college. Don't have to worry about it rn. ~Security - Malwarebytes + Windows defender+ ublock adblocker+ Privacy Badger+maybe a pop-up blocker.

Hello all, right now I am working in manual testing ( basically game testing),I like programming but my logic is not that good, so I have decided to go for Automation testing. I have learned java and selenium but I need some advice on what should I do next? How should I practice? Is automation good field?

Edit 1: for context - age 26F, BE computer science",seeseetwo," Not just manual testing, but QA/testing as a field is dying. We don't have separate devs/testers in most places nowadays.

Automation is actually a good step up if you want to get into programming. You can start from there and slowly build up. Meanwhile, you can keep preparing and practicing programming in your spare time. I can recommend a few online courses as well if you're really interested.

And hey, 'my logic is not strong' is not the way to go about this. Spend time, learn, and you'll do more than just fine. All the best. Automation is good field, but don't expect the testing to be a field that companies would be willing to spend on in the near future. Most of them are now hiring full stack engineers who should know to code end to end also are expected to test their own modules. Start working on your java skills, try python too it's easy to pick up if you already understand java. Get a bit onto coding daily, small programs and logic questions like in competitive programming should help you. Don't get disappointed keep on trying you would definitely get better at it.",2019-07-21 20:15:25

Should I consider Counselling and get a South Indian College? 

Or 

Should I study in Foreign?",Dishantgarg94," Medicine should be studied in the place where you expect to practice, ideally. 


Cons of going outside India:

One year of internship upon returning.

FMGE on returning. 

Virtually no patient contact in english/your vernacular. All in a new language. Requires certification. 

Phenomenal costs of home visits.


Cons of south india:

One year of PG prep since patient workload is too much.

Virtually no patient contact in your vernacular language. Most in a new language. Requires certification. 

Nominal costs of visiting home. Though still significant. 



Pros of going out.


Immaculate standards. But it's a curve. And third tier institute arent worth the expenditures.

Higher quality of life.

Degree Will be internationally recognized. 


Cons 

Best students rarely go out, so expectations are low. 573 isnt a bad score. But mind you there will be people who scored like 200. And since you're both Indian, you'll be viewed as one. Their faults become your faults.

Higher living costs. 

Degree Wont be respected in India. Dont go to Ukraine or Russia not worth it. Go for counselling. I will be frank with you. There is. No way to put this softly, but maybe medicine is not your friends calling. Entrance is just the start. The course is gonna be hell.",2019-06-20 19:13:02

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Situation with parents - Am I wrong?,62,as8cj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/as8cj5/askindia_situation_with_parents_am_i_wrong/,43,"27/M/Mumbai/Single/Only Son. Working a decent corporate job. I make \~14LPA. My parents are now retired. I've lived with them my whole life.

&#x200B;

I've had a good upbringing but my main problem has been that throughout my life, my family has been a group of over-thinkers, which has caused anxiety in me (and I'm sure in them) over things like ""What will you do?"" ""What if this?"" ""What if that?"" in every social, career, relationship position possible.

&#x200B;

Till they were working, this was fine, but ever since they've retired, they are finding it tough to deal with such situations. They have a good networth, we own 3 properties (live in 1, rented 1), they have a good corpus in the bank and they've invested money in good mediums. We are debt free. They feel they will run out of money, inflation will eat them up, they won't have food in their old age etc. This leads to fights daily among my parents and I am in the middle of the it playing the referee. In their fights, they demean each other calling out each other's weaknesses and failed ambitions in life. I felt this would happen a few days after retirement, but it's almost been a year now and it's non-stop.

&#x200B;

I do contribute to the house here and there but I feel that it'll hurt my father's ego if I start paying for household expenses. My father restricts a lot of travel to other cities citing expenses. My mom tells me in her fits of anger to ""pay"" for her to travel to other cities. I have volunteered but never followed through cause they never decided to go anywhere. **Are they waiting for me to take initiative / is their ego stopping them from asking / will I hurt their ego by paying?**

My mom has to feel in control of the house. With the timings of the maid to the food brought into the house. Even on the ocassions that my parents are back in their village for a week or two  - it's non stop. She cannot let go of things. **Does she feel she will lose control of the house if I take care of things?**

&#x200B;

There's a fight every second week over something or the other and the parents are not on talking terms for days. They had one today morning as I came to office. **Is this normal?**

&#x200B;

Now, this is leading me to a situation where I am :

1. Worried to make any big spends of my own and having the independence to do so - be it a trip with my friends, maybe a property on my name etc. How do I tackle this when it comes up? I don't want to be in a situation where my mom is like ""we aren't taking that train trip but you are going on joytrips with your friends?""
2. If I get married and live with my parents (Which my mom pretty much expects me to) will this be a conducive situation to start off my married life?  Specially with their fighting and all. How do I draw the line and be clear without hurting their feelings?
3. Has anyone moved out of their parents' house with some level of resentment (before or after marriage) and kept good cordial terms with their parents?
4. I feel a bit burdened and tied down in my house cause of few of the things here and otherwise. I am not always the happiest person when I get back home and look forward to office even though it's dull at times. Is this normal?
5. I have thoughts of getting a new job in another city and moving there alone and starting afresh (easier to change cities than get another house in the city). Is this okay? Does this make me a horrible child for abandoning 60 year old parents at home after retirement?

&#x200B;

Any other general pointers would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance.

Troubled, Yellow!

&#x200B;

TL;DR : 27M,Single, Live with parents in Mumbai. Parents keep fighting. Are controlling. Have big egos. Considering options in life without hurting them.

&#x200B;

Edit 1 : Added TL;DR",yellowledbetter07," Upvoted for visibility.

I feel the same situation will arise in home after I get a decent job given your mom and my mom's share similar traits.

Hope you find a good way to dissolve things, OP! Good luck! General advice: It may sound selfish . But then this is the time to be selfish. 10 years down the line you will be in their shoes and not young enough to follow your dreams.

Step 1: threaten to leave if they don’t mend their ways. 

Step 2: if they don’t change then actually leave. Take a job outside. Once you are gone they ll realise your importance. A little bit of distance helps. Unless they realise your importance they won’t hear you.

Step 3: move back and make them move with you once things are normal and you feel they are ready to listen and change.

There is no point wasting your life trying to convince them when in their eyes their ego is bigger than peace of family and your career. Same story at my house too. This problem isn't something that appeared one day, this problem existed long time back since you were a child. Now trying to change it won't help much. Maybe they'll understand you are not liking it and will stay silent in front of you. But once your back is turned, it will start again.

&#x200B;

For now, I suggest you stay at distance from them. Rent a house bit away or else buy one. Because whatever the matter is you shouldn't let daughter of someone else suffer it after marriage. Plus, it will give time to your parents to adjust to your absence rather than it suddenly happening after marriage.

&#x200B;

Regarding 5th point, I did it. Moved to Pune from Mumbai, refreshed life. Now I have my own place, I got married. My parents visit us once in awhile, we visit them once in a while. But I am sure my wife wouldn't have been able to survive them. It's not abandonment, you can always bring them to your home when age catches up and they actually need you. But till they are capable of handling themselves, let them do it. I can empathize with your parents. In most middle class Indian households, financial security is the biggest concern. I imagine your parents would have experienced some sort of financial strife in their life, which has made them this way.

So what to do? You have to ensure that you convey your respect to them. You volunteer to undertake some minor expenses... nay, you undertake some minor expenses like paying for cooking gas/groceries/telephone/internet etc. 

Keep pitching in, but also ensure that you have some sort of financial independence. Keep taking those trips with your friends... you're not obliged to take permission of your parents, but it's good to keep them informed.

 salary ctc hai ya net?

i had a friend in your situation, he set up a yoga center and put his parents in charge, now he makes money and his parents are busy with things they like to do and be in company of people of their age.  1. Find a job in another city and move out as soon as you can. You are not getting younger. You deserve to experience other things in life, this is not going to get better and you need time for other things. You can and should keep in touch with them 

2. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT, get married and live with your parents. Anywhere. Tell your wife about the situation and how you handle it and what she should ignore when things go south. Spend time in nurturing relationship with your wife. She should never feel that your parents control your actions. And they should not. 

3. Make sure your parents have resources in their old age, give sincere advice, be forceful while making logical arguments if needed, don't break relations, you can restrict the time you spend on them without making them feel helpless. Beyond that you don't need to do anything. Bhaad mein Gaye log kya kahenge. 

Be sincere to yourself and be confident.  Your parents might be doing this all the time because they might have nothing else to do. This may sound stupid but this happens all the time especially with retired people. You're now the man of the house. Act like you are. Talk to them firmly. Tell them if they don't stop arguing you will either move out, put them in a nursing home or in therapy. Tell them it's affecting you as well. 

Before doing this. 
Make sure you Go to Kesari, Veena world or Thomas cook with your parents. Show them the catalogs then let them choose. Make sure you take every aspect like weather conditions, clothing, no. Of days, etc. In consideration. Even after that they're not able to decide you decide it for them. If after the trip they don't change the behaviour then go for the first option. If possible,I would suggest trying to take your parents out of India. Somewhere not too costly like Singapore or Malaysia or even UAE. This way you and your father both can contribute. And make sure you go with them.  Hey Yellow, I think you already have answers to all your questions in your head but you need someone else to tell them to you. 


Well I hope this helps, I moved out of my house as soon as I got my current job, lived in same/different cities. Fast forward 6 years, right now living with wife and kid. Parents happy and content as we keep visiting them. Thankful to God ,my parents are not very fussy (old age problems yet to kick in) and keeping fit as of now.

Further,  I know it sounds very kiddish that,  there can be only one alpha male in the house, but it actually holds true specially with retired parents.

 Parents either one of them will not like you taking life decisions that too involving any kind of money and if they're not involved in decision making process they will feel and this will bug them continously. 

So be bold, make the move, take care. Control freak parents are the norm in India. If you are earning enough to take care of yourself and contribute to their well-being as well, then do as you please with your money.

Do try to spend it responsibly though, and one way is to invest a part of your income to support your long term needs. That way if theyfreak out or shame you for your expenditure, you have proof to make them STFU.

Oh, and you should stop being an intermediary when they fight. Things will eventually reach am equilibrium.

Also, just tell them that you are grown up, intend to take care of them when they are incapable, so they should not worry too much about money, within reason. Tell them to enjoy their post-retirement life doing some of the things they didn't while taking care of you.

If that does not work, tell them you will move out for your mental peace, if they can't resolve their differences like sensible adults. They have been together for 30 years and ought to know each other well by now. I am also the only child (son) and it sucks. The whole world is on your shoulders!!!  Send them for a short vacation or pilgrimage. This may sound stupid but they seem bored and worried thinking just about the future. Ask them if they really are debt free and don't have any hidden expense that they are worried about. One solution is to get one of them (the healthier one probably) something to do, like a cozy business. Doesn't need to be successful. Most people can't stand to be in close quarters with another 24x7. Especially those with arranged marriages and full time jobs.

It will be awkward to suggest though. You could phrase it like a favour to you, and the business could also be something you might want to grow down the line. One suggestion, I am not sure how it will be implemented but try to go to counselling first alone and then with parents. It helps to clear out your mind and chart a path for the future. But be aware it might give you answers which you didn't expect, but it helps. Upvoting for  visibility. ",2019-02-19 16:53:46

Keep fucking hand or handkerchief while sneezing/yawning [deleted] Don't play music/videos loudly in public places  Don't get your kids/toddlers/babies to cinema halls if you know they're going to cry. It spoils everyone's experience in the theatre. 

Also since I'm talking about theatres. If you're one of those people who crack jokes loudly in theatres, especially in Horror/Thriller movies. Please don't do that. People paid to watch the movie, not you. Be on time. I cannot tell you how many times I've been to some place only to wait for an hour because the person I was supposed to meet was only ""5 minutes away"". The whole ""I'm like that only. You should get used to it"" crap doesn't work. It's dishonest and disrespectful. If you say you'll be there at 4 pm, be there at 3.55 pm.  If you’re using things belonging to someone else or are in someone else’s home, please don’t disturb the general system and respect their belongings. 

Hate the people who leave their traces of being irresponsible guests.  Not sure if this is an etiquette but here : If someone says no to you for anything you ask, you shouldn't ask them to explain themselves.  Be civil.  Always use headphones before playing a voice message/video (like WhatsApp) from friends while others are around. Kya pata kamino ne kya bheja ho! Be considerate, don't be impatient. Use tit for two tat strategy for almost everything.

Many manners/etiquettes can be derived from these simple rules.

 There's absolutely no reason to ask a person about their lives or tell them how they should be doing something unless they're your SO or you're their supervisor in a professional setting. I've lost count how many times I've had to blatantly tell this to others and sometimes even say it out loud in public to embarrass them on purpose just so they give up doing that. Forming queue at any counter Chill the fuck out in traffic. Even with all your antics on road, you will only save a minute or two reach.  We Indian eat spices a lot resulting in bad body odour. 

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, please put on deo / spray when you go out. 

Also keep checking bad mouth odour and find some remedy which works best for you. For me, I keep some saunf at my desk and chew it once in a while.  Respect privacy.

 I feel like there should be a dedicated 24*7 channel to teach basic human etiquette to the people. Rich people, poor people all behave like animals in certain situations. First of all there's a concept of queue, second when there is ample space to stand comfortably then why the hell people shove their groins into the arse of man in front.

Then there's privacy issue at home, at work, at commute. List goes on and on.  Always excuse yourselves when you belch loudly infront of others.  It's rude to stare Always use blinker while u turn. Please, sorry and thank you go a long way. Sadly, many Indians think of it as just a British import.  Let the passenger get off from the delhi metro and then board.
 As a non smoker * Don't fucking smoke in the public areas. If you do so make sure smoke fumes do not effect the other people by maintaining some distance. You are not only damaging your lungs but surrounding peoples as well. * DON'T PEEK into other's phone. Repay your debt (small or midsized ones) on committed time/date. Or at least have a very good reason for further delay. Don't be obvious by showing off a new phone in front of the creditor at least, or have a fancy restaurant dinner and post it on Facebook. Somewhat related, but apparently it is acceptable to blow your nose in public? I’ve seen a few Americans/ Canadians do this while I was working with them. 
I never do this, I always wait when I am alone or go to the bathroom... What you have written is not etiquette, it is principle and shows character and security.

This might sound preachy and trigger those who are against religion but Buddhism (which allows you to be atheist and one branch encourages it) has these great principles of good living:

Take what you like, ignore the rest. 1. Don’t chew like a cow while eating. I can’t tell you how irritating that is. Most of my friends do it and it makes my blood boil. Feel like chopping their head off.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Crazy 45 day travel itinerary. Two clueless Canadians need your feedback! Too many cities? too much travel time?,62,9yln0s,https://imgur.com/a/mZ3xM9W,120,,PavelSokov," Himachal Ladakh in 3 days looks unrealistic. You need to get acclimatized to height and there are high chances of getting sick tired going through those roads. Yeah that's a lot...

You need to at least anticipate a few sick days If you are traveling from December to January , avoid trains because due to fog they get late , which will screw up your schedule. Use Double Decker or Shatabdi  from Delhi to Jaipur and Agra. They usually run on time. They are much safer for foreigner compared to other trains. For other parts of India use Rajdhani Express.   You come all the way and don't visit kerala /chennai. Too many cities, especially in Rajasthan. Skip a city, add a sick day. Is Varanasi and Hampi important for you? You could consider a national park or a place in the eastern part. One of the seven sisters?

I personally consider food an important part of Indian culture, you could add a place just for it's distinct food.  Visit Kerala instead of Varanasi, there is nothing much in Varanasi and it also dirty If you wanna experience himachal stay there for atleast 3-4 days, Ladakh a minimum of 6 days.

1-2 days are fine to see a city but you’re talking about a State/region here (which is almost the size of a European country.

Don’t rush, india shouldn’t be rushed. Plus as others pointed out, keep buffer days in between. Also, check out Indiamike.com for India travel planning. The forums are very active and useful with first hand account. Fuck Varanasi. Spend those days in Himachal or Ladhak I have nothing to add to your itinerary except few general recommendations for you travel.

1. Use Uber for taxi( You can select Cash options, Uber drivers love cash payments). If Uber is not available, remember don't pay more than 20Rs per KMS anywhere. Look for good taxis, We do have good taxi cars which are comfy like Toyota Innova/Crysta.
2. Stay away from beggars, I know it sounds bit weird, but In India, begging from tourists have become profession. DO NOT ENCOURAGE THEM. NO MATTER WHAT
3. Do not eat street food unless it's hygienic. Use Zomato app to find nearest good restaurants
4. Do not go to places just because it has cool pictures on few blogs. India is not as fascinating you might think it is. People are less than friendly to outsiders
5. Crime rate is more in Northern side(I am a Northie)
6. Do not fall into hands of agents, they will overcharge you by 10x.
7. To book train tickets use govt website [https://www.irctc.co.in/nget/](https://www.irctc.co.in/nget/) or their mobile app IRCTC
8. To book bus tickets you can use [redbus.com](https://redbus.com) or their app redbus Not visiting your hometown punjab? But yea I think you'll be tired most of  the time if you're traveling by Train to all these cities. 


Hope you enjoy the visit :) 




P. S. Also don't hesitate to take necessary precautions if you're a girl  you may wanna visit Sikkim but I don't know if it's any different than Canada 1. Please be safe and apply common sense in everything you do.
2. You'll almost certainly get undue attention, please dress appropriately.
3. Don't skimp too much on accomodation. Do look up reviews before you book hotels/hostels.
4. Stay topped up on diarrhea medicine.
5. Remember to haggle. Too rushed, too much distance and variation in altitude. What month is this planned? Travel planner here, PM me for a look over and suggestions. No charge ;-) You can skip Varanasi may be, a very long travel without much to see/do Man I can't imagine planning a travel. This looks good but be careful of altitude sickness for ladakh. You might need to acclimatize (someone else also mentioned this).

Use the Allapuzha visit to truly chill out and wind down your holiday. Stay in a houseboat. Would suggest extending it and reducing Mumbai time.  what? no statue of unity?? My two Paisa. Focus on the experience and not checking lists off. Divide our schedule between North India , South India and North East India, There is simply too much stuff to cover!! Quality over quantity my friends. You can experience India even in one city.  reduce the number of cities in Rajasthan. Add one in south or northeast. You could go to Sikkim instead of Varanasi. And then all the way down to Kerala. Skip Banaras ....for God's sake !!!!! -Varanasi +Kerala

Spend more time in Leh Ladakh

Spend some time in North East too. If in Himachal Pradesh visit Kasol for some good hash if you are into it. Also ladakh from Himachal in 3 days is tough,it is almost 500 Kms from Manali.  I am tired just looking at your itinerary.   Welcome travelers, very ambitious plans to be sure. 

You will be enriched but exhausted halfway through this grueling itinerary. Pick the top 6 spots and spend more time there, exploring the culture & cuisines, they are vastly different. Befriend the locals, but stay safe of course. Easiest cuts I would suggest are Varanasi, Rishikesh and probably Jaisalmer. From Delhi, you could pull off Agra as a day trip.

Give yourself a reason to return, you won't be disappointed. And finally good luck... we appreciate every loony and toony :) My main concern is whether you guys will be able to travel 45 days continuously without being mentally exhausted or falling sick. India is incredibly chaotic, probably beyond your imagination, esp if this is your first time. 

So I think it would be wise to concentrate on one region. For eg, stick to those northern regions for this trip and it a 20 - 25 day trip.

Then come back another time and cover the southern regions. Too much rush, skip shit cities like Agra and all. And leave Leh for another time. You really need to spend 2-3 days in each city to just catch the basic vibe.  Hey guys! Two other questions. Do you know any awesome silent meditation temple or something like that? When we look it up, we only find bullshit looking yours for California moms. We want the real deal, where we sleep 4 hours, don’t eat after 12, don’t talk. Etc.

Second question. Do we need rabbis vaccine? It’s 700$ Off topic, but how are you people able to afford 2 month long vacations? What happens to your jobs? Go to a holy place (tirtha) like Jagannatha Puri or Amritsar or a Temple town of South India where applicable, rent a room or rooms and spend the whole time there, observing daily life.  Ajanta Caves over rated - not worth the travel. Visit Elephanta Caves when in Mumbai for similar experience/images whilst savings days of travel. ",2018-11-20 06:17:08

Both of us are about 26 years old now and it was our first relationship. For the past couple of months, we've been in long distance.
 
I recently found out that I have breast cancer and there's not much hope.
 
Everywhere I look for advice on whether or not to share this truth, people suggest to tell the truth and while I agree with them, I think that the case here is different.
 
My boyfriend always wanted to do a love marriage and if I tell him the truth, he will stick around and might not be able to get over me. Since here in India, almost everyone gets married by their late 20s, I don't want to take away his time of finding someone new.

Tell him the truth, if he loves you he will understand. Don't be mean with his heart. But do understand he may also walk the other direction.  Tell him the truth. It's the respectful thing to do. Tell him the truth. 

>I still might be able to pull off a reason like I want to settle abroad, I won't be able to oppose my family etc.

Made up reasons might help you but will cause more pain and for both.

I hope you find a way out of your misery and things get better for you guys :) I am so sorry. Are you sure your cancer is terminal? I mean Im sure you have probably taken multiple opinions since its such a serious matter. I have seen Tata memorial hospital in Mumbai to be a really good oncology centre. There are insane amounts of people from all over the country who visit there. If you havent taken multiple opinions, I would recommend to take an opinion there.  We all have just one life. Better to tell the truth and go on from there and see what happens. Tell him.  I'm very very sorry to hear about your illness. Stay strong.  Also, telling him the truth would be the best thing to do. When in love, both of you are not different people but one. Tell him.

I sincerely hope that you recover. Godspeed. here's the thing u/randomuser2k: No matter what disease you have, and what circumstances you are going through, NEVER GIVE UP HOPE! Even if you have a disease that threatens your life, you still have ""some"" time! Let it be a day, a month, a year... doesn't matter! Spend time with each other, even if you are sick. Give him a chance to know the truth. If he really loves you, he will respect you and honour your wishes. I don't know your SO, and hence I can't comment on what might happen; but whatever happens, be it positive or negative, be honest. Lying will only be negative for both of you! Don't lose hope love. Breast cancer has high survival rates. Tell him the truth. This way you both can enjoy the time you have together. It may not end well and you may not get the perfect goodbye, but it will be fair to him as he will walk forward knowing everything. As for you, my depest sympathies. I hope for a miracle and hope you can survive for your full life.  Tell him the truth  :) Let’s be reasonable here. Whether you tell him or not, he will come to know of the truth one day.

If you don’t tell him, odds are he is going to live with an enormous guilt of never having been there for you. He is gonna go back and blame himself ‘I should’ve picked up that hint’, ‘I should’ve known’. Spare him that. This route also involves telling him more lies, which are best avoided at this stage. 

If you tell him now and decide to face it together, he ( if he is a sensible guy) will have the satisfaction of not letting you down and warm albeit bittersweet memories of you. Please give him that chance. Any guy would want to be given that chance. Moreover, he is only 26 and chances are he will definitely meet another girl when the hurt ebbs away, so your concern about him emotionally wrecked by the news hardly matters in the long term.

Do not lose hope sister. This might sound cliche, but I have always admired the fighting spirit of cancer patients. During my internship, I met a young navy officer with leukaemia. I still remember his beaming smile and the way he talked about life with such infectious enthusiasm. I had enormous respect for that guy. Be strong and positive. It makes a huge difference. We are praying for you. Tell him the truth Please.

What happens when he finds out later. 

Please I beg tell the truth.  First of all I am sorry this happened to you, and also dont loose hope just yet. There is always hope. I have known someone who was given 6 months to live but they lived more than 5 years. Try and live every moment, make amends with people.

From your post, I understand that your only concern about telling your bf is that he might not be able to get over it. But what if you dont tell him and if God forbid something happens to you and he finds out later? He may never be able to have that closure and it may be a lot harder for him to move on. Tell him. It is the right thing to do.

I had a friend years ago who lived in India pursuing his education while his parents were working abroad. He was the only child. Unfortunately he met with a serious motorcycle accident. His relatives asked his father to come to India saying that his grandmother was sick. The father came to India only to find out about his son being in serious condition and in a coma with little hope of survival. The father decided not to tell the mother and my friend was in coma for 8 days after which he passed away. The mother eventually came to India after his death and found out about her son. She was never able to forgive the father because he deprived her a chance of holding her son and begging God for his life. She never recovered from it and passed away a year later.

Having said that, if you do decide to tell your bf, you should also be prepared for every type of reaction. I am sure you know him well and he is a great guy but you sometimes dont truly know a person until he is put in a situation of pressure. He might not want to deal with all this and walk away. Just be ready for that and be prepared to forgive if that happens.

&#x200B;

Good luck. If your guy and you both could watch Sweet November and A Walk to Remember, he would be strong enough to understand the situation and will support you no matter what. I know it's a cheesy suggestion, but anything that helps you both through this situation and help you both understand each other. But do tell him, don't deprive him of this and let him be a part of it, I am sure he will. 

Make every memories count that's the most important thing for both of you. God bless and I'll pray for your health. Best of Luck.❤️ The truth, tell him the truth and if you want to talk about anything, I'll be there. You're dying and the thing that worries you the most is your boyfriend feeling bad? Please tell him about your situation. If he finds out later if or when you pass away, he will be devastated. It's not right. Sit down and discuss whether you want to be together in spite of your situation.

I hope you are cured of cancer. There are so many advances in the medical field today. 

&#x200B; Given your condition , I think he would actually want to be with you. Memories with you, even a few at this stage,  would be much better than a sad breakup.  I think you should trust your boyfriend with the facts instead of treating him like how we treat children by hiding the more gory side of things. Tell him the truth. Finding out after you for that you didn't give him the chance to make his own decisions (which could be to leave your, or to make the most of the days you have together) will probably bother him more in the long run. There are things that your boyfriend looks upto you to for. You complete each other emotionally. You understand that he takes you not only as a SO but also as a friend and someone he can confide in. 
In my naive opinion, you should tell him. 

Also note that once you tell him, the way he reacts could be something you had not imagined. 3 probable cases :

- He might be very supportive and will help you get treated. 
- He might be emotionally shattered for ages. 
- He might leave you. 

You know him better, read all the comments and then take a decision. Seek a professional consultation if are not able to decide.  Firstly I""m sorry that you are having to go through this. 

However I'd sincerely ask you to tell him. **Live the journey of life**....the destination is over rated.  It feels bad about your situation and one can only imagine the trauma which you would be going through. Honestly, it is a very difficult decision. We don't know about your boyfriend and we would tell based on our context-less experiences. Choose a decision which brings peace to you based on your understanding of him and your relationship. May be you both can have something beautiful together till the time permits.  Tell him.  Even if you lie, eventually he will know the truth. Unless you live in another part of the world with no common friends. Rather than hurting him twice, making him ready for it.  just tell the truth. seriously truth works I sincerely hope that you live long and have grandchildren and be a goofy ol grandma. However, if you die, make sure that you die at the age of 27 and join the infamous '27' club and say hi to Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix and Amy winehouse from my side.
Also, be truthful with your boyfriend. I believe you can make it through this. Don't give up. If you need any sort of support, i will always be here.Cancer is terrible, i hope you stay strong.  Which stage is it? Where are you getting treated? 

And on the topic of telling your boyfriend about it, you should realise that he has a right to know about it. And you won't be doing him a favour as you would like to think. He will know later and would be scarred for his entire life. If you do love him as you claim, you tell him. Period.  He'll be heartbroken if he comes to know the hard way. Please don't make him go through this. His maturity might surprise you. Also, stay strong, OP. :* if you love him tell him.

if he loves you, he will want as much time as he can get with you. More than the question if he has a right to know, don't you think he should know it? You say you have this perfect relationship and you won't even tell him this one truth about yourself which might as well be the single most important fact of his life. While I am misty eyed while I write this to you and my heart goes out to you completely, I am putting myself in his shoes and writing this. I would be completely heartbroken when first I would have to go through the breakup and even if somehow I were to find love again, and then if by chance I get to know about you and the why of the end of the relationship I would even be more heartbroken. One can love someone so much but never so much as much as you can miss them.
You have an infinity to live in whatsoever the finite days you have with him and perhaps these days will may as well be the most important or memorable days of his life and yours as well. 
Wish I could give you all the years of my life! I'm really sorry to hear about your ailment, and I wish you strength in this time. 

As for your question, I differ to your noble intentions. There is no easy answer in this. It's HIS love and he deserves to make the choice whether he wants to suffer or not. Trust me, it will hurt him ten times more if he finds out later.

PS: You are a good person. You deserve happiness. Don't push him away. And I hope a miracle happens for you. Man what a shitty situation to end up in. I don't have any useful advice I'm afraid. Just wanted to say you are stuck in a shit show, fuck cancer. Best of luck! Tell the truth please, you will be gone but he will feel really guilty for not being there for you when you need him the most. If he decides to stand by you, you both will have share the last moments with yourselves and he can then begin to move on as he has a proper closure. If he doesn't decide to stick by you, well you achieved your purpose of breaking up.

Hopefully you get well soon though! A diagnosis of Breast cancer does not equate to dying. Consult your doctor for awareness and relief from your mental agony. Thanks. Everyone that loves you will be there with you in hard times. They would fight to be around you. 
   Let him make the decision. Don't Rob him from spending the precious limited time with someone he loves. 
   If he turns the other way and leaves, (which I personally doubt because I'm rooting for you), he didn't deserve you. 
   Make the most out of this time. It's ok to be selfish at times. Have a blast, do something you always wanted to do. And I still hope that there is some procedure or therapy that kicks this cancer's butt. 


Stay Strong! Don't assume that you know what is best for your partner. Godspeed internet stranger. being a guy, i wont be able to move on if my girl tells me she is about to die

but ill be happy atleast she didn't keep it a secret.


 im imagining all this and i feel like crying. im so so so sorry  Telling truth may make him sad and you guys can plan accordingly.

But knowing the truth once you are dead will broke him for life and above!  Tell him the truth. Lies will get you (or him) absolutely nowhere. I feel he (and you) deserve the truth. If he takes some decision based on that, atleast he did so with the correct input. Lying about it, helps absolutely no one IMHO. You shouldn't do that to him, and you really shouldn't do that to yourself. Eh a bitter truth is better than a very painful lie.  I'm sorry that you have to fail this terrible situation. I'd suggest you talk to his family about you people and tell them you are dying. It is very important to have support of family in time of such great pain. Figure out a way to break it to him, he needs to know and have closure, maybe go to a counselor or psychiatrist.  You should also post on relationship advice  I have seen quite a few breast cancer patients survive and lead a normal life without their mammary glands ofcourse. Are you sure you have taken the best opinions??  Your boyfriend deserves to be given the chance to make his own decisions and live with them. Don’t rob him of his agency. 

Tell him.  The fact that his SO was dying and chose not to confide in him will mess up his mind for a long time

Also hang in there OP.Sometimes it is hard to put the effort for your friends and face them when you are dealing with this.More often than not the support system helps

Fuck Cancer You should tell the truth. It's hard but it's the right decision. Oh my goodness, I am so sorry for your troubles. Here's my advice: Do tell him what is happening because he's your boyfriend and if you guys have planned on getting (love) married, you should feel comfortable being totally honest with each other. No matter what he chooses to do, wouldn't you want him to know?  he deserves to know the truth. Tell him as it is, and then its his decision what he wants to do.  I'm surprised you made a post on an anonymous forum to debate this issue. Talk to your near and dear ones and take their help.  I am so sorry you are going through this OP. 

You need to tell your boy friend the truth! I don't have any advice but I'm sorry this happened to you. All the luck and prayers for you. :* Tell him. Not because it’s a respectable thing for him or anything, but if he loves you, it’d break his heart that he never knew about your condition and he will feel miserable about it.  Also no matter how hopeless the situation might sound, don’t lose hope.  People in the real world understand. I'm pretty sure you yourself won't be able to maintain this big of a lie you are planning to say. Enjoy every day with him. I think you are afraid he will walk away after you tell him the truth  isn't breast cancer curable?

AskIndia,"[AskIndia] I speak modern hindi. Hypothetically, how far could I travel back in time and still be able to have a meaningful conversation with a hindi/hindustani speaker?",105,apdunu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/apdunu/askindia_i_speak_modern_hindi_hypothetically_how/,23,,ajaiswal07," inspired by a similar question on /r/AskHistorians Amateur linguistics enthusiast here.

After late 1700s-early 1800s, you could get yourself understood comfortably over large swathes of Northern India. Language was largely standardised in northern India at that point due to the influence of the British and more so, as they increased their influence and for administrative efficiency. 

And before that, inter-intelligibility of your spoken language would largely depend on the region you're in.  
If you spoke in standard sanskritised shudh hindi, you could've gotten by with reasonable comfort in eastern UP/bihar region. Linguists call this the Awadhi dialect. 
If you spoke in persianised hindi, with loanwords of persian origin, you could've got yourself understood in western UP, NCR, parts of Haryana and Rajasthan. There used to be a separate dialect called Brajbhasha spoken in these parts too, the language in which Meerabai wrote her poems.

So comfortably, let's say you could've made it work until about early 1600s.

In fact, hindi grammar wasn't even standardised until 1954. Even if the other speaker understands what you are saying, he/she might still be surprised by your use of vocabulary. Hindi then (Hindustani) generally had a higher percentage of Urdu than it has now. Modern Hindi contains a lot of words that probably didn't exist in the past. So hypothetically if you travel back in time you won't be going too far, probably 17th-18th century at most during the later stages of Mughal era or starting of the British Raj. Modern Hindi also relies heavily on English words. I doubt the generation of our great-grandparents would understand a lot of words we use today. I think transportation was a lot limited then and in general culture exchange between places too. Local languages had more space to develop especially in rural places. Hindustani would be restricted to imperial cities, and merchants because it provides a common medium. Rural areas didn't need it and probably didn't bother to learn Hindi.

Hindi itself differs area to area vocabulary wise today.  you should ask how many kilometers you can drive from your home & still be understood by ""hindi speaking"" people. I guess around 1200 CE the time of the Delhi Sultanate. 

But to some extent the Gupta empire 500 CE may also retain some form of the language but I think that would be highly unlikely.

Edit: BCE - CE You could manage talking to people till 12th century.
You can manage upto 1st and 2nd century with South Indian languages.  [deleted] There are two hindis? Which one are you going to make it the national language? How high are you? ",2019-02-11 15:25:37

Fucked up my life. Took 5 years to complete my computer engineering in 2017 with 59%, jobless since then. Have no more interest in getting a job, learning or living. When I was in college, I was full of energy, could accomplish whatever I had planned.

After graduation, tables have turned. Parents say I am a big burden, nearing 25. Dad is behaving a bit weird mentally. Mom is stressed by her office work. Everyday I wake up to the same routine, just lying in the bed, pretending to find a job, avoiding parents and friends, I use laptop and smartphone the entire day.

I have one more month till my parents kick me out from the house. I have tried reforming myself multiple times, but after every 3rd or 4th day, I come back to my old habits. Put a lot of weight after I graduated.

Earlier this year, I received Canadian Permanent Residence and I now live in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Not bad for an engineering dropout, eh? Turns out life doesn’t implode because you didn’t ace your engineering degree.

But now you've graduated with some backlogs. Well what you should understand from this is, you cannot do a job or look for a job that's work from home. You need an office job or on the go job right now. Because you've gained weight and not moving out of your bed.

All these seem like classic cases of clinical depression (of course, my knowledge is only limited to what I have read). So get professional help.

[Go through this link](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/detecting-depression) and see if it fits you. DO NOT fall for confirmation bias; that is don't force fit the symptoms to that of yours. Be extremely critical with the signs and scrutinize your past actions.

Some questions could be:

1. Are you demotivated a lot? Do you feel blank most of the times? 

2. Have you stopped doing something that you loved doing before?

There is nothing wrong in seeking professional help for this. Consult with a psychiatrist and get yourself diagnosed. And if you're diagnosed with something it could change your life and improve it. There are many such success stories out in the real world.

Don't prefer sending her to North East states as it will be far. Also Delhi being Delhi has scope for much better opportunities. I feel Civil will be the best bet for her. 

- She could prepare for Software - get ample free time
- She could continue in Civil - get through IES
- prepare for UPSC - being at Delhi might help
- go for MBA 

Engineering Physics can be beneficial only if she is highly interested and capable in Physics and would want to go for Higher Studies. That she doesn't have any idea of at this stage. 

What do you advice? For eg. Someone suggested to get into Thapar Electronics but I don't think that would be a good idea. DTU is way better collg than Thapar imo. Only dampener is, I have heard, that there is NO branch-change in DTU!? Any other options???

She should go for BioTech or Engineering Physics if she is interested in academic research (which generally means that she would have to pursue further studies/PhD).

I personally would advise her to go for research (cause I think more Indians should do that) but then again not everyone is made for research and it depends on what she wants too.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] What is the most unethical HR practice in your organisation?,110,9jdplh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9jdplh/askindia_what_is_the_most_unethical_hr_practice/,177,,InsomniacNimrod," Note sure if it was a Practice. So this happened to me after a Joined a well know IT company now my former organization, which prides its self to be ""ethical"". 

I was already employed when a had attended an interview with this company, After I was selected post interviews, I was asked to submit previous experience related documents, so that HR could prepare a compensation package. After submitting my documents to them, they took approximately a month and gave me an offer letter, which I accepted. I informed them of my notice period at that time to which they agreed. On completion of my notice period, I joined this company. The first day was induction, which went of fine. So far everything seemed good. On the second day during the orientation program, during the break HR asked me to meet them. There I was informed that ""we checked your documents again and it seems that there was a mistake in calculating your experience, so we are going to reduce the offer we had made"" Then they gave me two options, I accept the revised reduced compensation OR If its not OK I can leave.

I told them their new deal was not only unacceptable, but was also unethical. Since they had a more than a month to verify the documents and release the offer, it was not my fault but theirs. Also objected to the tone in which they said to take the revised deal or leave, as I had already left my previous job, and they could not just leave anyone high and dry. Since I was already a part of the organization now, I would not accept it, and told will definitely escalate this. Thankfully was able to get it escalated and the original offer stood. Still it left a bad taste. Just wondering how many other faced this situation there.

Update: As someone mentioned, I guess this was a screwup by someone in the intake team and they were trying to retrospectively  fix their error. I didn't have to actually escalate it, like in writing and inquiry stuff, spoke to the HR manager in charge, and was told they would look into it. Probably in the background they must have let it stand. Don't think it was an organizational policy, so naming the company may not be appropriate. &#x200B;

Pretty much every other startup in India and primarily those run by heads/management comprising of Indians (or even Indian origin)  have

1. Sandwich leaves
2. Shitty or non-existent work-from-home policy
3. Demanding that one be 24x7x365 on call cause they are ""solving super cool next generation"" food/shit/stuff ordering tech
4. Only role of HR - organizing friday cake party (with only one cake for 150 people) or holding rangoli competitions via fun teams (obligatory mention: sanjay rajoura speaking of 'fun commandos')
5. Never ever speak to anyone in the org about the working environment
6. Always tracking butt in seat time of employees
7. Snooping on conversations between employees
8. Offer baiting - Bait one with a larger CTC , only to change terms on joining day
9. Not paying dues on time. Making final settlement a hopeless saga
10. Never trying to grow a spine to help employees but always siding with the management whatever shit be the reason
11. 'Flexible' leave policy
12. Even more 'flexible' work hours
13. Prioritizing equipment over employee. Ever heard of an employee being fined upto 30000 Rs to compensate for a damaged laptop, just after he survived the accident by sheer chance?
14. Managing a show item office. Gym, TT is only to look at and not use during office hours, only between 9 PM to 9 AM
15. A 'no-music even with headphones' policy
16. Everyday morning assembly (standup sessions) to be started by praising the lawd ie the CEO/boss/whoever jackass that is
17. Rejecting claims for travel/food expenses by capping ridiculous impractical budgets. Know a well-funded startup that expected employees to survive in metros (Mumbai, Delhi) on a budget of 600 Rs per day covering acco, travel and food
18. Tracking if any female employees are visiting maternity/fertility centres and prepping the firing pipeline using ridiculous reasons
19. Convincing employees that a lower hike in salary is not necessarily a big deal
20. Mastering the art of turning HR into 'hideous remorselessness'
21. Locked pantries, refrigerators for exclusive use by idiots of the highest pecking order

&#x200B;

Not all these are true for many mid-sized and large firms. For startups, most of it is true. The chutiyapa called ""sandwich system"" of marking leaves... There is this IT company in Chennai , which boasts of being ethical and product company. The HR have setup a rule to put on a tie on every monday. So one monday i forgot to wear the tie. The Head HR comes to me and says nothing but takes my Employee ID. I was like why did she ask that at first. But realised its the Tie and nothing else. Then next day she calls me and tells to come to a meeting room. When i entered the Room , there was HR and other employees who had not wore tie the last day. Now they are telling us that we will be suspended for 3 days for not wearing tie and pay will be cut. I was like what man are u serious. I told them, to make people known about the rule that there is a suspension for 3 days for not wearing tie is not to first suspend but you could have mailed about the rule which was not mentioned anywhere . Then they said we have orders from above . I was like dont give silly reasons when u have none. Then i took 3 days suspension and my friends still laugh while looking back on those days. God save the people of those who are still there.I got lucky and got out. My previous organisation had 3 month notice period. So people were leaving as and when they get an offer without serving NP. The MD/HR implemented a policy to deduct 25% of salary for 6 months consecutively or submit the original degree certificate and passport which will be released on the last working day. Mofo even claimed he consulted his lawyer and was legal.

One girl who was with the company for 3 years left without serving NP and in BG verification call he gave negative feedback going so far to saying she is a fraud. Essentially ruined her career. 

Edit:

Another policy is to hire 2-3 employees for support which can be done by someone who completed school. But MD picks Engineering candidates who are Freshers or struggling to find a real job. After joining the offer/appointment letter will be delayed stating silly reasons. He will monitor them for a week or 2 and terminate all but 1 who is good at buttering. 

I hate him with a passion.  At my previous employer in Saudi Arabia the HR passport officer and accounts officer (both of them were Indians) had formed an alliance where they would demand bribes in order to get things done. 
For example, cash or dinner at a fancy restaurant for their families in order to release my vacation salary, cash to get visas stamped, cash to get residence permit renewed on time, cash to get profession changed on residence permit etc.
 Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with Bruce Meyers in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates, and HR doesn't give a shit. i have to clock 9 hours a day, which is okay for me.

but it comes with a clause, i have to punch in before 10:01 AM. even a second later is a half-day. 

for a half-day is compensated by reducing a full-day from the leaves balance. what math. Don't think it's unethical but it was definitely toxic.

The CEO asked this to the sales head during a team meeting of all department heads:

""What is your firing target?""

Everyone was confused what he meant. So he explained:

""Sales team should not spend too much money on salespeople. To keep the team lean, you should keep hiring and firing people till you get the right balance. They will not work if there is no fear of getting fired.""

 The organization has an employee referral program but the HR just fuckin wouldn't hire your candidate. They'll everything to reject it and hire through the HR agencies they work with. No wonder why.. A famous MNC , having multiple offices around Bangalore. One of my friend asked for a release from a project she was tagged in, because she stayed really far from Whitefield, and also had to take care of her mother. She almost traveled 60 KMs daily. When she approached the HR, he was like ""Okay, I'll release you, but I'll make sure you'll get tagged to a project in Delhi/Kolkata"", which made no fucking sense. HRs in this company are a total mess. [deleted] Ours is a vast organisation and there is a high chance you all have interacted with it at least once. My narcissistic CEO wants to handle everything himself, every department from Finance to publicity to foreign relations. Due to this idiotic and entirely stupid nature none of his ""major economic overhaul"" ideas work and fall completely flat but the thing is when stakeholders start demanding for explanation that trash of a person never ever comes forward or talk to them, instead he starts sending his juniors to respond and that *dharti ka bojh* is so *lallu* that he sends Finance manager to a advertisement meet, Transportation Incharge to HR meet.

Recently the CEO and his minions were caught to in some shady dealings but that little shit is still not responding to stakeholders and is sending his minions to start the blame game on competitors. I think I should resign from this company because I've no doubt if CEO is not booted out from the company along with his minions no one can stop it from crash, and instead join other comapny but I've spent 30 years in this organisation and have no where else to go. Bhaiyon aur bahanon, aap logon ke Private Organisation ke utpidan ko dekh ke lagta hai mai Central government me comparatively kam salary me hi thik hun. Dhanyawad. My experience with a previous organization - giving cookie cutter fake resume to clients, inflating years of experience, keeping on billing the client for people who have left the company. And baiting new joiners with certain terms of employment but switching as soon as they join.

Another organization tried to cut off the HR consultant after successful recruitment with their help.

Moral of the story- Never add your boss on your social media.  r/expectedoffice So I work in a PSU Bank which is going to implement strict biometric attendance from Oct 1st to monitor late coming staff which is a welcome move.

So we are marked as late comers on most of the days and absent on some days.  There’s an unofficial rule at my workplace. Appraisal hikes are decided based on your family circumstances 

Working husband and unemployed wife - good hikes 
Working husband , unemployed wife with kids - qualifies for even better hikes 
Working husband , employed wife but wife doesn’t have a well paid job - decent hike 
Working husband, employed wife with wife in a IT job - not so great hike ( why do they need money ,  both of them working anyways)  Reading all these comments, I feel lucky for working in my organisation. The H.R. is one much better than what we could have asked for.",2018-09-27 23:13:42
AskIndia,[AskIndia][NP] Why do they talk in English in most Bollywood interviews?,16,atd17z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/atd17z/askindianp_why_do_they_talk_in_english_in_most/,44,,aguyfrominternet," Not for all of them, but for many of the stars, their everyday language of thinking and communication is English.

Many of the movie scripts are written in English, with English dialogue, and later translated to Hindi.  most of them are star kids from rich families, elite social circles and attended schools where they hung around kids from other uber rich families so English is like their first language. there is no denying that the rich prefer English over Hindi. It's a language everyone can speak with a good level of fluency, most urban people in India are 80% Westernized so English is actually the most natural language for us, I'm sure you're talking about Koffee, it's on Star World which is an English channel.  Because English would be easy to understand compared the Hindi and it's slangs atleast in Interview . In the movie we have the context and even if somewords go over my head it is OK . Recent example GullyBoy . I am not a native Hindi speaker and I watch some interview's time to time on Film Companion& FC South( Youtube ) when they were asked why all their content is in English they mentioned the same thing making it English gives wide range of Audience . 

And the Fact that some of the South Actors are from north/Foreign and some of the North Actors are from South / Foreign . It makes sense to have the interview in the Language everyone is comfortable in . Just like Rule #3 of r/India



 A lot of actresses can't even speak proper Hindi. Also, a lot of actors are looked down upon if they are hindi speaking. Apparently, it's a sign of non-urban upbringing. 

Also, these actors have a lot of insecurities that gets covered by language! Why not? English is spoken all over. Not everyone speaks hindi, English is the common thread amongst all our languages. Fortunately most in Tamil industry sticks to Tamil.  If the interviewer asks the question in English, it'd look silly if answered in Hindi and vice versa.  
English channels and portals would have the interviews in English generally and Hindi ones in Hindi.  Exceptions do happen though.   The obvious trivial answer is that they're mostly more comfortable with English than Hindi - that the language of thought is English.

That's obviously because the ""better"" schools in India are English-medium.

But I find a little amusing the objection to that, and the vilification of those whose English is better than their Hindi.

It makes SENSE for English to be the primary language of education, and I think it's atrocious that students from vernacular medium schools can get through 12+ years of education without enough functional English to survive college.  The purpose of language is communication. And for better or worse, the world has adopted English as the international language of communication.  You might say it's largely due to historical reasons of empire, but English is also a very flexible language, able to adapt new vocabularies very rapidly.  

You might say Bollywood is the Hindi film industry, so they should speak Hindi. But then Bollywood is in Maharashtra,  so shouldn't it all be Marathi? 
Should South Indian actors and technicians be disallowed from participation in Bollywood? Or should they have a Hindi language qualification for entry?

In a country like India, it makes perfect sense to use the only common language that connects all regions.  And Indian English is a legitimate dialect in its own right - we are not using the language of Imperialists really.

By that token, Hindi is certainly not a natural language of even the so-called ""Hindi Belt"". Hindi is a synthetic language, specifically created to standardize a lingua franca for the northern regions.

Indian English does the same for the whole nation. People from South India follow the lives of these celebrities too. Speaking in Hindi would alienate an entire region. “Aaj mai kar ke aaya hai” Why do some of them talk in hindi?  Isn't India basically English speaking? I mean it's the de facto common language  Kahe ki speaking ingles makes you look educated and upmarket. You can't afford to be a bollywood bigwig and speak like a dehati, not with the world watching you. Might sound crude when spoken out loud like this, but it's true.",2019-02-22 12:27:13
AskIndia,[AskIndia] How do you get rid of repressed anger buried inside?,74,a2x0y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2x0y7/askindia_how_do_you_get_rid_of_repressed_anger/,66,"I have a lot of anger buried due to school kids bullying, rejection in college and work and one highly toxic family. Cousins used to treat me like a servant and for the most part my dad was unavailable and only cared if I were to make money but never stood up for me or never even tried to bring me up (expected fucking nothing). Thanks to a rough 25 years despite being in a good place relatively in life I have high amounts of repressed anger.



Basically I was bigger than most (6'3"" and confident as fuck) so I was made to be feel ashamed of my size by everyone which led to low self esteem, and everyone loved bullying someone bigger than them so even when I grew up Everytime I was bullied I never used force and sucked it up.




How to release this anger in a healthy way? I've tried sports, gym, everything. I want to be emotionally stable and healthy before I start a new job so I really want to know if someone successfully relieved of their anger.



Asking in randia also because the preferred method is screaming and there are no open places to scream here.",for_acedemia," See a therapist  What you're calling anger is mostly shame and fear. Shame that you let it happen to you and fear that it'll probably happen again and you won't do anything about it. Inner criticism is far worse than outer critics. You need to start becoming nice to yourself first. When that genuinely happens standing up for yourself won't be that hard, like you'd do for anybody you truly love. Sadly, loving ourselves doesn't come that easily, because most people learn to see themselves from others' eyes. I'll tell you a secret, it's completely okay to get bullied, that is the nature of the world and not just for humans. Because there's always somebody smarter stronger than you. Most people will say you could use that as a fuel to become smarter stronger yourself, that's one approach, but it won't bring lasting happiness. Being okay and fulfilled with your weaknesses and flaws truly brings and happiness. And the knowledge that you're not passing the negativity to others. Generally, people like you who are not bullying somebody else weaker to vent are naturally better humans. You can keep aside all the religions of the world, this is the true religion, letting the negativity die at you. But like I said in the beginning, you have to learn to handle shame and fear by looking at yourself NOT from your critics' point of view. This is what probably was implied when Shiva drank the poison. And when Christ died for the sins. This is the inherent nature of the world. I tried meditation, going on peaceful place but these doesn't work in my case. So I masturbate to rid out shit.  Load up GTA:SA and drive over anyone and everyone I can find or load up RDR and ride a horse through the country side. Seek out for a good therapist. It is lot of trial and error for finding a good therapist. But, remember to always throw the mask and be open about everything.  My height is not as per 'Indian norms'. I got bullied half my life, got involved into smoking, drinking at very early age. After some time i realised this is not my life. I started meditation (learnt it from my local yoga centre). Stopped smoking, drinking, joined gym and starting believing in myself. Right now i dont have a job sometimes that makes me angry but try to control it. Sometimes i say things which i never meant to but i say sorry as soon as i realise my mistake. It helps to keep me grounded. And life is good.  First you need a goal in life, so pick up something worthwhile. Second you need to resolve the anger. The best way to do that is by writing down things that made you angry. If you can assume that each of the things that made you angry is a result of something that you wanted to do, and have the potential to do, but you were not able to because of that emotional outburst, then you have a way of making productive use of all that memory.  Third is to learn to control yourself. Which is different from withholding or limiting yourself. Control means you can regulate your emotions at will. That happens when you realize that everyone else is as clueless as you about their emotions. They bring anger/frustration into a conversation unknowingly. When they do bring it, they don't know how to keep it under control either. If you can learn to recognize when you get emotional, and you can find a way to pull yourself out of that state, then you can keep control of your anger, the key is to know that you can and that your own subconscious holds the key to that. Exercise or masturbate Meditation and mindfulness?

Wow. Just goes to show, nobody is spared suffering, even those we'd assume would be spared. I see you posting off and on but had no idea you were going through this (but then, how would I?)

>Asking in randia also because the preferred method is screaming and there are no open places to scream here.

This is a big problem. There are too many people and nowhere to go and just *be.*

There's this AI chatbot that is receiving a lot of coverage in the media. Maybe it can be of some use to you: [https://woebot.io/](https://woebot.io/) I used to do push ups until I was too tired to move. Go to Eastern Europe or the US, and go to a shooting range, I am sure you could try different kinds of guns and also get rid of that pent up anger. Find someone who is being bullied.Try to make friends with them.It wont be hard.Look into your family and find the less blessed person.Help them,help them reach out and stand up for themselves.Help them to fight back(peacefully ofcourse) and establish their worth.You will find happiness in that.That you were able to bring change in someone elses life.That you helped someone who is going through the same shit you did.

Try it out >  want to be emotionally stable and healthy before I start a new job

don't connect these two. treat them as separate. emotional health is a life-long quest (for everyone) The four noble truths and the eightfold path of Buddhism.

Maximum serenity, minimum restlessness and violence.

OTOH, there is also a practical way to vent, but it is a patch and damaging in the medium term (everything is ok in the long term):

Cussing the hell out of each of the people who wronged you.

The damage is that your language becomes very foul and you start using abuses for even normal things. The benefit is that the pressure building up inside gets released and the sorrow doesn't go to deep down into your heart and make you a bitter person.

---------------

I think you should always remind yourself of eternal truths:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot#Reflections

People have insecurities because of memetics (picked up from others) or genetics (some creative assholes invent new abuses and crimes). Mostly they don't know or control what happens in their life and pass on their burdens to you. These burdens keep passing around like rogue data packets on the internet from node to node, some nodes becoming power-relays, while some just temporary relays (got into bad company then got out OR got depressed, then got fixed)

There is no telling what shitstreams are headed your way in this network (life), the best you can do it have a built-in firewall against rogue packets and don't get infected. Gentle reflection / gentle introspection is a constant necessity in life. 

""I'm not like that"" and ""I don't need this crap in my life"" are typical things to say to yourself and GTFO of abusive situations.

You can also take the saint approach and study the insecurities of the source of the shitstream. Then you will feel bad for them and how shitty their life is and how yours is marginally (or significantly) better as you can identify a shitstream while they cannot.

Nobody, except sociopaths and some psychopaths (genetics), is born evil, evil spreads through society and pollutes good minds like a virus on a network (memetics).

Anger is a self-harming response - imagine if every  computer anti-virus randomly deleted its own files just because it encountered a virus on the network. Do not do this. 

Develop a non-violent response based on identifying and ignoring the virus passed to you. People are shit because by the time they are 18 they have been dragged through tons of shit floating around.

Many metaphors, same advice - identify it, quarantine it, then let it go.

EDIT:

What people do not realise is that anger is hurting yourself, it is first-class self-harm. When you commit violence in your mind, it's _your_ mind that bears the brunt of the violence. This is why the really wise criminals never get angry. They are cool, collected, calculated and very very effective - spies, for example, or bosses of large corporations or lawyers. Of course, don't be like them, but learn how even they are never self-harming.

Deep breathing (eyes closed), holding your breath, watching your thoughts and letting it go (some amount forgiveness, some amount discarding a bag of poop) are useful techniques.
 Try to make someone smile or happy every day. Help an old man lift his bag. Buy a poor kid some food or help in an orphanage. Compliment someone on a job well done. Really mean it. It will make your day. Gradually your anger issues must reduce . I have been doing meditation for 10 minutes a day for the last 5 months. Have started seeing some results recently.
Meditation probably won't help you get over it, but to accept it, and to manage it.  I have the same problems these days. An intense and tiring workout helps for a short time. Mainly being tired helps.  Just let it go. You cannot change the past but you can build a better future for yourself. I guess the basic question is how is this repressed anger affecting your life now?  > the preferred method is screaming 

I do this too. Stops me from doing/saying things in the heat of the moment which I'll regret later. I usually drive around and with all the windows up and music turned up, scream at the top of my lung. Few years back I was furious and lost my voice for few days doing this.

&#x200B; Punching bag Scream. To muffle your voice, use a pillow or something. 

I am going through the same. 

In my case. It is weird because I don't feel anything for humans except rage. Go outside and do things on your own, like be independent. Move out, get a job, pay your own rent and be independent. That will teach you everything you need to know. It's a long process.

What worked for me was telling myself, ""I control what defines me"" Folks here have already given a good advice, so I'm just gonna be repeating some of it. It's also what helped me. Doesn't mean it will help you too, everybody is different. But you could take it as a starting point and see what works.

1. One thing I didn't see anyone suggesting is journaling. Write. In a diary, in a google doc under password, on a blog no one knows about. But write precisely how you feel. It's going to be shameful sometimes, but that's part of the process. Shameful in the sense that I used to think, 'I am a nice person, how can *I* feel this way about others?!' So be it, you aren't acting on it, you just need to voice it. I used to write in a notebook as well as in a google doc. Some of those notebooks have holes in them because I used to stab them with the pen :/

2. After sometime, reread your entries. Sometimes when I did that, I used to feel the rage all over again, but sometimes I could realize, 'oh ok I could've acted differently here'.

3. Therapy. *Essential.* Because a good therapist provides you tools to deal with your own baggage better than an internet stranger!

4. I read this somewhere and adopted it for myself: nature abhors vacuum. If you're emptying yourself of anger, you need to replace it with something else. Otherwise, old mind habits can come back easily. Just good old 'old habits die hard' kind of thing. By replacing, I mean, by other mind activities. So yes, sports, hobbies, new skills, new courses, anything. (I tried to learn foreign language for a while, and my class ages were 14 to 39. It was bliss!)

Oh, yeah, and of course fap :D

Good luck! It will sort itself out once you're about 30. That's when most people suddenly wake up and realize that the entire world and this thing we call ""life"" is nothing but a big joke. We have given our own existence waaay too much importance. We're microbes on a floating rock that can be extinguished into oblivion if Jupiter decides to sneeze and send one of its 200 moons hurtling towards us. The reason you're angry is that because you have inherently believed that everyone else is correct and that they're smarter than you. But take one look at their life and you'll realize that barring a very very very small percentage of the population, everyone else is just lost, delusional and chasing after some paper dream that they don't even know why they're chasing after. Think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize that half of the population is more stupid than that. This thing called ""society"" is a big sham set up by people who can't tell their head from their ass. Once you realize all of this, then you'll accept that you're just like everyone else, a small cog in a big wheel, grinding their life away so that you can have more Gandhi papers in your bank account but without any time to spend those papers. Everyone else is part of this machine, no one can escape it unless he/she truly, truly wants to and is willing to sacrifice everything else for it. As long as someone is part of this machine, then that person is neither better than you nor inferior to you, he/she is just as lost, delusional and stupid as you, which means he/she is an equal, and there is no need for you to take his/her word seriously.

But you are at an age where you cannot comprehend this. You still think that you're the center of the universe, and that your life is so fragile that someone can ruin your day by sneezing in your general direction. You need to step out of that shell you have built around yourself and realize how small and insignificant your so-called ""identity"" is, and how equally small and insignificant rest of humanity is. It will take a long long time to understand this. Until then, just keep going with the flow. As long as you keep going until you're about 30, then you will automatically understand this. For now, best of luck - things like music and inspirational videos can help to sustain and feed the illusion of ego until you no longer need the ego and these support accessories, and things like sports / gaming / netflix can help to keep the mind distracted until you learn to control the mind. That's how everyone else gets by, should work for you too. Look up stoicism. Vipassana. Workout ! Convert those anger to insane gainzz Pump iron period. Imagine the faces in plates and dumbles. U did not try hard enough.  buy a punching bag. Surprisingly, breaking stuff helps, I won't advice it though. Travel man, travel alone to new places; it helps a lot. Also, music.  By channelling that potential energy into something productive.  Learn to compartmentalize. Not just anger, everything. I've become very good at putting things away that I don't need to attend to immediately. 

Anytime you struggle with something - anger, anxiety, etc. - ask yourself: does this impact me in the immediate moment? Do I need to deal with it right now or can I put it away for later?

I don't have any anxiety issues because of this. Whenever I get slightly anxious, I just put it away for the future.

Same with anger. Do you *really* need to be angry right now, or can you deal with it n the future? Emigrate.. From your words it seems more like bundled up frustration which needs to be relieved more than released. You should be seeking help from professionals like a therapist or a psychiatrist before this evolves any further into a mental disease like depression which is a common outcome of such cases.

Take care and don't be afraid to reach out for help. If you feel you are reasonably mentally stable, I suggest trying out a Vipassana retreat. It can be a little trying and hard but unless you've been diagnosed with something like a clinical depression, it is worth giving a shot.  Fap. A lot.

What is this major problem? Equal opportunity doesn’t mean equal outcome. You can create reservations for women in politics but it doesn’t necessarily mean that more women will be inclined to join politics. All you can do is create awareness and leave the choice to them. Why just stop there? Reserve 70-80% seats for backward castes because that's their true population proportion. I don't know how i feel about reservations in general. But if we do implement reservation then why not make it proportional to the actual ratio of men and women? Even if this happens, most seats will be won by women who will be the puppets of their husbands/family, aka Ravri Devi. There needs to be good governance set in place, the probability of an independent woman making it to the top is very less in India unless she's already having a career in politics, which most seats won't have. Let’s also reserve seats based on religion, caste, height, weight, skin tone and length of penis. /s",2019-06-17 14:03:00

The money is refundable if you want to stop using their services. Apart from that till their commercial launch which is in 6 months in Hyderabad their service is free with the data usgae up to 1150 gb. If you're being offered Jio Fiber, get Jio Fiber. It's brilliant Many ISPs have lowered internet rates or ditched FUP because of this, if jio launches with a data cap It'll be a huge disappointment. I wanted to get JioFiber at my place after seeing my cousin ""testing"" (enjoying it free) for over a year or two at his place. So I placed a call to ask for my building permission. They haven't laid it yet. Now I know my skeptical society secretary is OP who must have shooed them away. /s My friend has been using jio fiber for about 2 years for free. Get it installed in your building and use it for free until they come up with plans and decide on the pricing. (And are ready for official rollout) ""Free"" means they'll spy on you by creating a profile of you based on your browsing data. I mean, you could let em set up and it's the choice of your building co-tenants to join or not. Doesn't harm you to share space with some fibre.

I'm very torn on Jio. On one hand, yes it's trendy/important to resist Reliance but on the other hand it is equally important to put the fear of ~~God~~ Ambani into ISPs like Airtel and Chodhafone who really take customers for granted. They overcharged customers for months and months after Jio and Act Fibre introduced cheaper plans (referring to 4G and broadband respectively). They are companies who I feel if given their own way and no competition, will absolutely disadvantage Indian consumers. Therefore, it's important to have Jio on their asses. Which city? It's legit, they came to my house a couple weeks back. Looks like they're doing a trial run. I had to pay a refundable deposit of Rs. 4500. The 'plan'(not official since it's a trial run) I'm currently on is 100Mbps (1100GB FUP). OP which Town are you in ? Just so I can know how fast Jio Gigabfiber is expandng? My society has been having Jio Fiber for the past 2 months but I haven't joined because 

* They have a monthly cap of 100 GB
* They're currently have a 3 months free trial but there's no information about the pricing. Last week another Jio guy came and he told me plans would come out after the 20th
* They wouldn't connect the fiber to my existing Cisco router saying I have to rent their router which I'm not eager to do since mine is much secure, advanced and comes with a lot of functions You've to pay a deposit of 4.5k. But after that it's free for a few months  They have chosen localities in each of the cities/towns they are planning to set it up in the first phase and are setting the network up there. They plan on extending connections to big societies next. Since it is in trial phase, you only have to pay for the network device being set up in the home. No word on pricing yet. In my city they also have been testing TV channels over the same network.  

What I am really curious about is the promised use of VR for shopping etc. That will truly be next level thing as far as current choices go. Expect competitor's cables to be cut one fine day - I'd give it a 10-15% chance 100GB download limit per month ? No thanks.",2018-12-17 13:52:49

It is locked, fairly simpering in nature, and lacks any controversy section.

The equivalent entry on [Dhirubhai Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani) is not locked but is also fairly blank in its description. 

Wikipedia is supposed to a neutral entry for human knowledge curated by the community. In instances where an article is repeatedly vandalized or at constant risk of vandalization, it can be expected to be ""locked"" from edits that are not approved by a higher power.

I'm not the first to mention this. One Quora user (in a post titled ""How corrupt is Mukesh Ambani?
"") described his attempt to edit the page and how it was stumped by higher-level editors.

In the case of India's richest and most powerful person, it is understandable that certain information is undesirable in the public realm. However, that does not mean we should bow our heads.

Finding out anything about the Ambani's is notoriously difficult. Sure, you could follow newspaper headlines over the least few years but they have a tendency of being fickle. Remember when Ambani's kid mowed someone over in an Aston Martin? Or when the family was involved in a [bitter feud](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19890831-bombay-dyeing-reliance-feud-ril-executive-arrested-on-charge-of-conspiring-to-kill-nusli-wadia-816444-1989-08-31) with Nusli Wadia (that culminated in a murder charge)?

The saga of Ambani is too vast to remember everything. Only a person who reads the paper every day for the last 75 years will know their true history and even then he knows just a fraction. I admit, I don't know enough. But I do know that there is a concerted attempt to control information about Reliance.

We see it in [Reliance ownership of the media](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/the-big-five-the-media-companies-that-the-modi-government-must-scrutinise-to-fulfill-its-promise-of-ending-crony-capitalism), in their purchase and regulation of our satire ([they even bought out FakingNews.com](https://www.medianama.com/2013/05/223-firstpost-fakingnews/) in its early days - understanding early that such sites could be far more critical than investigatory journalists and far more apt as well). We see it in [near billion dollar](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-row-anil-ambani-files-rs-5000-crore-defamation-suit-against-national-herald-congress-leader/articleshow/65546040.cms) defamation cases. We see it when books that try to tell this story [are banned from being published in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Polyester_Prince).

You know what is happening. I know what is happening. We all know it. Anyone on the street will tell you this and that about how Ambani pulls every string. And I will be the first to be realistic. 

**However, an open ledger of information does not have the same weakness as a media organisation that has to pay salaries.** 

Use a proxy and edit. Cite your sources well. What are you doing wrong when it is done in the name of the truth? But before this can even happen, don't we need to get past that lock?

To get an edit made through a semi-protected article, you need to propose an edit on its talk page. 

Honestly, if I knew enough and wasn't afraid myself, I'd make the edits. But I think there might be smarter and better people on here who could give me added perspective. I don't have experience editing Wikipedia and I believe in this happening to a fair standard.

Just putting this out there. My apologies if my own action seem toothless. ",Top-_-_-_-_-Secret," There are pr agencies that control wiki accounts that hold a lot of powers of change and edits. These accounts have been slowly been taken over wikipedia. This is one of the reasons wiki is now loosing it's trust factor. 

I have personally met many agencies who have offered to maintain and boost wiki entries and remove negative post. One even claimed that they could lock posts as they have many accounts that can hold leverage when discussing happen on wiki. 

Edit:typo I think there have been a couple of books written on the Ambanis. One of them is available [here](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=ambani&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def). The other you can find on [*Amazon*](https://www.amazon.in/Ambani-Sons-Hamish-McDonald-ebook/dp/B00MXSAGBA/). There's also one by Paranjoy Guha Thakurta [here](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=Paranjoy+Guha+Thakurta&column=author). Read them and start making your contributions. 1,000 Crore defamation suit incoming! This needs more visibility. This should reach white man Reddit for you to get any solid reach on the topic Wiki pages are being rampantly edited by RW and status quo aristocracy. Even in page of hemant karkare the case of his death was edited and the RSS angle mellowed out , if not totally deleted.  (Edit: Apologies for the long response, but you might find it helpful) As a semi-frequent contributor on Wikipedia, I get your frustration, but I think you have it somewhat wrong, for a few reasons:

1. The Mukesh Ambani page is not actually locked, it is only semi-protected so that more trusted users can edit it.  It may appear to be 'locked' to you if you are not an auto-confirmed user.   But I don't even edit THAT much, and I can access that page because I am auto-confirmed.  The guidelines state that to become autoconfirmed, doesn't take that much effort:*""...most English Wikipedia user accounts that are more than four days old and have made at least 10 edits (including deleted ones) are considered autoconfirmed.""*  Basically when admins semi-protect a page, it is just a safeguard against vandals who cherry-pick pages and don't even really contribute to Wikipedia.  These people don't even have active accounts because if they did, they would be given 'blocked' tags quickly and punished until they proved themselves not to be disruptive.

2. You stated:  *In instances where an article is repeatedly vandalized or at constant risk of vandalization, it can be expected to be ""locked"" from edits that are not approved by a higher power.*  This is also not completely true.  For example, if I wanted to, I could make edits right now to the Ambani page without needing any sort of approval from an editor, and as long as the edit was neutral and well-sourced, it would stay there unless it was challenged for good reason from an other editor.  I could even create a 'controversy' section if I wanted to, again, as long as the info was unbiased and presented fairly.  And you can too, once you become autoconfirmed with 10+edits and an account older than 4 days.  ""Higher Power"" does not mean that certain editors act as a safeguard over specific articles and can cherry-pick what is accepted; that's not how it works at all- anyone can freely add info and it will not be removed as long as it is well-documented.  You are right that Wikipedia is an 'open ledger of information' - for example, Vikas Bahl, the ousted producer, cannot just delete his name from the Me Too (India) Wikipedia page, because it is well-sourced - nor could he 'pay' Wikipedia to do so (unlike, I'm guessing, Facebook or Twitter).


3. You also said: *To get an edit made through a semi-protected article, you need to propose an edit on its talk page.*  Again, this is not totally true - it may be the case if you are not autoconfirmed, but if you are, then you are free to edit directly.  In fact, some articles for films (esp. Bollywood films) are semi-protected, like [Thugs of Hindostan,](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thugs_of_Hindostan&action=edit)
[or the upcoming Kedarnath movie.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kedarnath_(film)
And yet I have been editing both with no problems nor needing to go through the talk pages.  Talk pages are only really used for disputes or to address presentation issues, typically between a few users and an admin, and are often used as a last resort if conflicts can't be solved on the edit page or on the users' own talk pages.

So yea it's not all what it seems to be.  I feel sympathetic to you because I remember being a beginning editor myself and feeling that the odds are kind of stacked against you. You keep editing and trying, and you often don't get the formatting quite right, or don't source properly, etc. And when you make an honest mistake, admins can at times be overly abrupt and rude because they deal with many instances like that in a day, or because they deal with plenty of stubborn beginners that have taught them that being direct is the best policy.  Not all are like that, most are friendly, but it still takes getting used to for a beginner sometimes.  For me, it has all been through trial and error - moments of frustration at thinking it's ""all unfair"" and then eventually seeing that yes, some of it is, but a lot of the rules do help a lot. It is true that Wikipedia now has pretty strict guidelines for editing and has administrators (who basically are advanced users who have been using Wikipedia for years and know its policies inside out) who keep most of the tabs on vandalism, editing errors, etc.  In short, yes there can be a bit of a 'red-tape' feeling if you're just a beginner contributor.  But if you keep at it, you might see (like I did), that the rules and guidelines are helpful and there for a reason, and for the most part are fair and impartial.  

For example, early on I tried to change the top page pictures for articles on some famous actors because I thought the pics were either too old or not good-looking enough.  So I changed a few pages, only to find all the changes reverted by an admin; I was lightly lectured on the copyright laws on Wikipedia and how non-free pictures need to be uploaded by the initial user to Wikipedia Commons, or else the non-free picture must be implied to have a Fair Use as per public domain, like movie posters, etc.  It was only after trial and error that I really got to know how and when to upload properly, and why the rules were like that.  

This is just one example, there are other times where I nearly pulled my hair out just trying to learn and disagreeing with other editors.  But I find that for the most part, everyone does things with a mind for neutrality.  Of course, it's not easy when ANYONE can change their mind or type what they want- so it's tricky at times, and yes I'll admit that I don't always agree with them.  But I think by and large the 'governization' of Wikipedia is more helpful than not.  If you keep at it, you'll find it rewarding as time goes on, I bet. Hmm. Gotta check the deep wiki. Good question. Been a long time and frequent editor on Wikipedia. If the matter is based on reliable sources, then nobody can stop someone from adding such a section, though you’ll have to be careful in your wording as matter will be removed if it even appears borderline attack page/section.",2018-11-25 02:37:17
AskIndia,[AskIndia] Would anyone be interested in a behind the scenes explanation of how UPI works?,215,9rohgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9rohgg/askindia_would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_behind/,72,"Can throw in wallets/credit cards/debit cards as well. I work for a leading digital payments company and think that the entire ecosystem is pretty fascinating. Will be quite a bit of work from my side so will get down to it only if people are interested. Will also cover fund-flows/settlement and how money actually moves.  
  
EDIT: Thanks, guys! Will sit down for an hour or so sometime over this weekend and come up with a post.",southkasanta," super interested I have worked on the backend of an UPI application. 
Trust me, It was really an amazing to project on. Lots to learn. 

Entire ecosystem looks something like this:
Mobile 1 (bank1 app)  <- - > PSP(bank1's payment service provider) <- - > NPCI(gov entity) <- - > PSP(bank2's payment service provider)  <- - > Mobile 2(bank2 app)

To make a transaction happens there are more than 8  hops but it is still too fast. Session management is another important use-case. Once you are signed in to your bank on one phone, you can not sign in into same app through different phone. 

You can download and read the documents from NPCI website. 


 Are you talking about, like YouTube videos and stuff? Go for it.  Also please cover some of the smart card technology of credit cards and how it enhances security. If possible also touch upon Contactless cards.

I would also be interested in card not present transactions and how they are enabled. Here. Have a basic knowledge but would love to know more If you can put a small paragraph on IMPS, NEFT and RTGS for comparing their background mechanisms that would be great too. Chaliye shuru karte hai I haven't used UPI and don't know why we have so many digital payment modes. The BSNL payment portal for example has like 10 different options. How does the layman figure out which one benefits him? yes please definitely interested

&#x200B; Definitely would love to know about it.  yyaa Yes! Yes!!  Yes Absolutely! Very much interested. I don't know anything about it and haven't even used it yet. YESS!!!  Hell yeah! Goddamn. Definitely interested  I am really interested to know how foreign transactions work. Can you an AMA? Or can I DM some questions to you which you can answer?  Hi i am super interested, especially how foreign transactions work. I work as a tech lawyer and do a lot of work on digital payments.  Yes, please.
A write up would be a good way.  If I remember right, its something like.

Client -> NPCI -> [BankCreditor, BankCreditee]

So, when you make a request to transfer money, NPCI makes a call to validate the 2 accounts (or maybe it already has that context, not sure), and then pulls money from source account, then transfers that to the destination account.

Although it doesn't seem like much, know that there are very few countries with such a system in place. Most countries have some systems (which are plagued by a lot of crap) usually bank-bank partnerships / or some private entity that tries to partner with a large number of banks. This is because quite a few (or rather most) of banking systems are still in paper tech / or massive data dumps that just lie there. And apart from this, the APIs of each banks tend to follow very different schemes, hence implementing systems that actually tackle all of them is quite hard. There are large agreements between many banks etc. (I think Bank of America has a pretty big one), then there are private players who do the same (I think wonga from UK has one), and then there are a few examples of centralised ones (Example: China). There are also a few countries where there is pretty much one defacto bank, so it kinda works out for most people like that etc.

PS: One important thing to note that the ledger adjustments and actual money transfer also happens instantaneously. Its not like it is adjusted by NPCI at the end of the day or something like that.

The fact that a government entity managed to do the same, and in a really quick and secure manner, is something to actually be proud of.

There was supposed to have been a V2 of this (which actually came, but is considered a failure because the feature list that it initially promised for V2 were not part of it). But once the actual features of the V2 ( I think it related to stuff like allowing companies to ping via UPI directly, automatic repayments / mandate collections via UPI etc.) That will be a massive power-play which will have a major impact. Yes please! YES!! 

Some questions about CC and DC.

1. https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/21168/how-does-amazon-bill-me-without-the-cvc-cvv-cvv2  How/Why is that ^ possible? Is it possible to do so in India?


2. I have seen that Amazon and other companies take it upon themselves to save our card information to ""make our lives easier"". They also take the CVV. Why are they allowed to do that?

3. A friend told me that cross-border card transactions are a different level of evil altogether. Could you elaborate on this?

4. I have seen multiple people who have no idea about their liabilities that they have for any fraudulent debit or credit card transaction. Where does one learn and manage the situations where shit hits the fan.

-------

On UPI:

UPI has made our lives easier. We don't have to share or make mistakes while sharing the bank account no., IFSC for transactions. I think the most important factor is there's no need for using the failure-prone SMS-based 2FA while conducting UPI transactions. 

Billdesk or ICICI have got one feature related to UPI that I really really like. I wish razorpay, instamojo picked up on that feature. I will add a screenshot here to better explain it).


Coming to the bad/hidden pitfalls of UPI:

1. Grievance Redressal for UPI transactions is shit.

2. The problem of including 3rd party companies is that every transaction is being watched. Further these companies share data or can share data with other companies, sometimes with your permission (PhonePe - Ola). The problem here is most end-users are unaware of the consequences of such data sharing.

3. While an end-user (with multiple bank accounts behind a single VPA on a single app) can select which account he wants to spend the money from but if he receives the money, it is received automatically in the default bank account set in the app. This makes it difficult for the user to separate different bank accounts for separate purposes. Only workaround is to have separate bank accounts on different UPI apps. Is there any idea/plan to allow separate UPI VPAs for different accounts in one app?

4. UPI at this time does not allow/support registered mobile number changes, ie, if you change your phone number registered with the bank account(for which you have a registered VPA on an UPI app) and you want to change the number on the UPI app as well, you won't be able to do so. UPI by design(confirmed by NPCI's twitter account) does not allow the UPI App to change the number. So you have to create a new UPI account with the new mobile number. So all your transaction records will be lost. While transaction records are mirrored in your bank statements, its very hard to discern the mobile, DTH, electricity recharges that you might have done using the UPI app. Also many a times some part fo the recharges are paid by discounts or wallet cash, this adds an additional layer of grunt work while accounting.

5. I have seen that companies like Uber and Ola being on the fence for including UPI payments on their app. Uber initially opened UPI baed payments on the app but then they took it down and now you can't link your UPI VPA to your uber account anymore. I read that these guys were waiting for auto-withdrawal to be enabled in UPI2.0. Also UPI has a lot of failed transactions for cab-payments and the redressal mechanism isn't top notch and some people have been asked to pay twice by mistake. Why does UPI suck so much for time-critical payments like cabs, food deliveries, etc.?

 Please make this happen!! Yes please !! Awesome! Just what I was looking for? I wanted to know more about VPA and are there any limits on how many VPA can be created for an account. Is it possible to create disposable VPA intended for a single transaction? (like in bitcoin)?  I love UPI and would definitely like to know about the internals. RemindMe! 1 week Great initiative, I have always been fascinated by it. 
I mean the amount of transactions it supports,the speed, interoperability, simplicity etc. Is it going to be a major threat to cc and dc companies ? 
Also how costly or cheaper is it than other modes of payment ? Why is there no other system like it in other parts of the world ? Is it that tough to do so ? 
Also what are companies like phone pe and paytm doing in this ? I mean apart from interface what are their contributing ? Yes  Nice! I am interested

RemindME! 1 week ""UPI payment"" PhonePe ? tag me pls RemindMe! 2 days Would love to know more!! It was actually in my mind for a month. Would like to know. I don't like the confusing multiple UPI ids thing though due to multiple UPI apps.

I envy Google Pay/Tez as it has taken the credit of much of the UPI really, at least in the view of an average person, not Bhim or UPI. What do you think of this?

I also think they should've mandated a single UPI id for a single bank account in a non App agnostic way. Sometimes people ask me if I have Tez, I used to tell them I don't but I have Bhim and they can send to it from Tez. Some people don't understand, some people just don't do because they would miss out offers :) Yes please How do I hack UPI? Not interested at all Yeah no. Thanks anyways.",2018-10-27 04:48:01

1. Window tints on cars [Incident ??]
2. Porn ban [Incident ??]

Also mention why the rule was enacted, based on which incident",tHeSiD," 1. Intercaste marriage rule is the dumbest and archaic of them all. 

After notifying the registrars office, couples details including picture is put on a notice board for 30 days and a letter to their residential addresses.

Edit:

2. We live in India, yet you can't drive a vehicle registered in a different state for more than 6 months. why can't they centralise the transportation department?

3. Mobile network - roaming charges if you don't have a special recharge. I can only think this is to make more money. 

I would very much like to know why the RTO isn't centralised and IC marriage rule in enacted.  Pubg ban that May happen soon... Idk why Indians moms worry so much its not the games mistake that their kids play it 24x7 so instead of identifying the cause why your kid is playing so much Pubg or any other gane for that fact  they will just blame the game and say its Ruining my kids life ; your kid will anyway end up finding some other game or some other thing that he/she will end up getting addicted to something else and go on the wrong path if the real underlying problem is not solved  >Window tints on cars [Incident ??]

Even if the common man forgets about it, goons will make sure that you are reminded by appearing on TV. way too popular in Bangalore, can't find a place to go out and just have a meal on that day. I believe it is a holiday that is a capitalist wet dream. Commercialisation ruined it just as it did other days.

Valentine's day has no place in Indian culture because romantic love has no place in India except in our films and TVs. So when these kids inundated with notions of romance take to the streets and public parks, the self appointed guardians of CULTURE will use violence in open defiance of the law to promote their political party to a people that will tacitly approve because sour grapes.


 In urban areas, it's very popular. Majority of young couples celebrate it. we are given a national-level public holiday on this day except for goa - they are made to work extra hours on this day as most tourists expel max semen on this auspicious day in this specific state and the same needs to be cleaned before the next couple jumps in.

most of our young people moan and many redditors groan on this god-given holy day. are you from bajrang dal ? I’m a college student and it’s pretty popular on campus.

I just don't know what else to do.",Throaway607," If your concern is being broke very soon, apply for jobs in all fast food chains that you can name. Apply to all call centres you can google. All the retail stores in every mall in Hyderabad. Call them, email them, go there and talk to the manager and get shooed away till you find someone. Once you're there, then you plan how to make things *better*. It's not the end. It's just a scary beginning. [deleted] From my experience of soliciting jobs in McD outlets: 
Go to any McD outlet, request any employee (preferably at the counter) that you need to talk with the store manager. Ask the store manager if there are any vacancies in the oultlet. Most of the times, they do have vacancies especially in a busy outlet. Store manager will ask your expected salary. Don't quote him a figure (I quoted an over-estimated figure and never received the call from him again). Just say that I am ready to work at the standard rates as per the company's policy. FYI, standard pay at McD is Rs.49 per hour. So, earnings will depend upon the hours you are willing to put in, lets say Rs.49 * 10hrs * 25 days. Meals will be provided in McD probably for lunch and dinner. Some store managers might ask you to wear a white shirt for the 1st 2 days for training. You will require documents like aadhar, PAN, marksheets/certificates etc of your school/college on the 1st day. 

Get into this job only if you are in urgent need. I wasn't in such need, hence I declined after listening to all their terms and conditions. go to malls and walk in every store and ask if they have an opening, your english is good, say them you can speak english. 

or go to fastfood chains like kfc, mc donalds and try. else try dhabas or hotels.  Not what you have asked for.. but my 2 cents:

I think you have to prepare better to move out permanently. Consider going back to your home for time being and prepare a plan. 

I am not recommending you to stay in a toxic home forever. May be set a deadline of 1 month for yourself. In this time prepare for permanent takeoff. Consider opportunities available to you and prepare for them if required..

Stay strong brother ! Instead of going to a completely different state. Try to find something in Maharashtra. It will be much easier considering you will not have any issues with language and such.

I would recommend that you go back and talk to your parents. Take their help and then do something. Construction and hotels are the only jobs that I know that give you immediate boarding and lodging.  Do you have friends in Hyderabad ? check with the hyd local marathi groups there are a lot of them here and would be more inclined to help you Why not Mumbai.   Amazon hiring 24/7 for CS positions, decent salary considering you have no degree. I can refer you. Considering you can speak English well (from your post), you can apply in call centres or any shop as sales guy. But you'll need money till first pay check. If not try construction sites such as Hyderabad metro. They'll provide accommodation.  Keeping in mind the documents you have in hand, I'd suggest seeking opportunities to drive for a living immediately. Ola and Meru operators are in constant dirth of good drivers. You'd get time in between trips to exercise your writing skills if over time you've managed to save up for a cheap/used laptop that you can use to do online content writing and eventually move into that domain.

>I apologize if my post isn't appropriate for this sub.

You're good Karma got you here bro, the occasional holy herb would guide you through these testing times. Boom Shankar! How are your English speaking skills?

I have friends in Tech support. Will see how I can help. Didn't you gather any software development skills for the time you were in college? 

I too droped out of college, but I was able to support myself by giving chemistry tutions to kids. And in my free time I taught myself software development, and my life is back on track.

So you can take that route as well, unless you have other plans. You should really go back to your house. And then try getting a job nearby, get a rented place and then move out. Leaving home this fast without much plans won't do any good. I'm looking for freelance writers for my company. Ping me if you can, and would like to, write Apart from everything mentioned, you can also consider freelancing. You seem to have a good grasp on English. Content writing jobs pay pretty well if you go through the right channels. 

Try applying to WittyPen. Best of luck. :) Did you do it the legal way or just like without telling your parents? I hope you have a great life ahead.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Need career advice from complete strangers.,13,b8u3xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b8u3xw/askindia_need_career_advice_from_complete/,15,"Hello, I am your typical engineer wanting to do an MBA.
As of now I have two years of workex, and an acceptance from a top 10 MBA college (1.6LPM Hojaega in a few years). My father however has his own project management consultancy, and is suggesting I join it.
I enjoy the consultancy bit, and the engineering part, but it doesn't pay as well as a Top MBA job would. So now I am confused, primarily because :
1. Dad's company = My company, plus staying at home (I've had loneliness induced anxiety before)  is a big thing.
2. MBA has a huge loan attached (25L+interest) which I need a lot of time to pay off.
3. Even if I stay home, I'll have to get some specialization in my field of engineering. So more padhai, along with work.
4. I can always work and make the consultancy bigger, expand it. 
5. From various people that I've talked to, once you're making good money, it's difficult to come back and start working for yourself. 

Tldr : Top 10 MBA college vs Baap ka kaam

Edit : Made it to a Top 5 college today.
Anybody else willing to help me make an informed decision?",toitsmort," There's really no way to answer your question. Some people  would tell you to join your father's company because they'd hate working for others. Others would recommend MBA since the financial security that comes with it is important to them (MBA grads can shift from one industry to another without significant loss in pay and hence can manage well during troubling economy and downturn in specific industries). People will answer with their personal biases.

For both the options, there's pretty much the same risks and payoffs involved. You can do mba, fail to get a good job, and then struggle to pay the loan, OR you can get a great placement in big firm and be set for life with steadily growing pay and job security. If you choose your father's company, you'd become like Bezos, or you'd end up bankrupt. There's no way anyone can predict what will happen. 

This is actually the sort of decision that you will need to decide for yourself after considering both financial aspects as well as whether you'd enjoy working in either of the two streams. if you don't mind, as a potential MBA aspirant, I'd like to ask you a couple of a questions. can i comment/dm? I would rather be paying 1.6Lpm than earning it.  There are multiple options you could explore. For instance, join your dad’s firm, explore relevant certifications ( you said project management so I’m guessing a PMP, PSM or ITIL would be relevant), build up experience and then explore a full time or executive mba a few years down the line. As I’m sure you know an mba is more to do with building key business skills rather than learning about finance or marketing topics. Plus whenever you take over your dad’s business a full time an MBA would also add credibility to your CV if you were to seek funding or scout for clients; and also use the alumni network for the same. 

Again- this is just one suggested approach.  >Dad's company = My company

Are you sure? How much authority or power will you get after joining your dad's company? Consider all these before making your decision.

I know a guy who decided to join his father's business after engineering. Later he discovered that he didn't actually had much authority because the dad was controlling everything. Moreover, he didn't get much salary because apparently everything was his in the future so why bother with salary.",2019-04-03 13:45:58

AskIndia,[AskIndia]What's your Unethical LifeProTip?,158,8wc8lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8wc8lm/askindiawhats_your_unethical_lifeprotip/,199,"Let me share the one I know.
If you want to avail free delivery on FK for low priced items make sure to add an extra item to your cart so that it goes beyond ₹500. You can cancel the other item later to get only the desired item.",sagardrokr," Dunno if this is unethical, but if you're struggling with customer service for any company, ask to *escalate* it to their manager. It probably affects their valuation, but it gets the job done. The very word escalate sends chills into the process, and lets the shit roll uphill for a brief period.

Got my ISP to fix my damn internet issues after 3-4 rounds of pointless customer care haggling. They sent a truck and checked all the lines. The irony is I was going to shift to another ISP a couple of weeks after that :P I know only the most obvious tip that everyone knows: you can pay bribes to get out of almost any situation especially if it's govt related. My friend works in Bsnl. Goes to office at 2pm comes home at 5pm. Thug Life.
 If you are in a heated argument with someone or if someone is being rude/loud just say ""first brush your teeth, your breathe is stinking"". My credit card gives 1000 points for making at least 4 (or 6?) transactions of Rs 1000+ per month. Now in a month, I easily spend more than what's required, but sometimes I forget to use the card at all in a month, so they send a message on the last week saying I have to make 2 more transactions or whatever to get 1000 points. So I transfer the money to Paytm or any other wallet which can be used later. My friend used to order items online and then cancel before they were shipped. It'll be refunded in a week, but transaction is made. 

These days, I don't need to do it as generally I'm spending more organically. Also, you can transfer money from Paytm to bank directly and use the same money to pay the credit card bill.

Bonus: Every year, when my credit card fee needs to be paid, I call the customer center and complain that fee is too high and I want to cancel the card. They waive off the fee (although for people who don't use the card much, they do it on certain conditions, they have waived off the fee for me unconditionally, for 2 years straight). [removed] 1.

If you’re a girl, making puppy face with lil bit of crying will get you out of most situations.

Been there, done that. (Tho crying was genuine most of the times) Always carry only a 100 rupee note in the wallet. If you get stopped by a cop for something then show your wallet to him and tell him you only have 100 bucks. He will take it and move on.  Our house is super convulated to locate. We can take advantage of dominos 30 minute guarantee almost 30% of the time. Another non-unethical and useful tip: when ordering drinks like iced tea/cola at outlets like McD and KFC, always order them without ice. They have a separate entry for it in their machines and they'll do it readily. The drink out of the vending machine is already ice cold. Filling half the glass with ice just means less drink for you. It may be another thing if you are planning to nurse your drink for an hour. If you doing that Flipkart will block your account. Don't use that too often.

Works for pretty much every company offering discounts for first time buyers [deleted] TL;DR - Lie to your parents

More like r/im14andthisisunethical but when I was a wee lad, every time I needed my parent's permission for some outing I'd tell them that Amit's (not real name) parents allowed already and Amit would tell his parents that my parents allowed already. My parents knew Amit pretty well so if they knew he was going to be there they'd be like yeah sure. Same for Amit. 

In college, I'd seen so many people with helicopter parents lie constantly about everything. Even about small trips to the general store. ""Why is there so much noise beta"" ""Mumma because I'm in the mess, do you not trust me? Would I lie to you yada yada."" Eh I would lie about late nights out too. While my parents generally didn't have any problem, my mom would worry excessively and not sleep until I told her I got home.

So basically gaslight your parents to have fun.  Use a blocked card for a one month trial thing that companies offer. They can’t charge you if the card is not working. Works especially for things like Apple Music where they give you 3 months free and then start deducting money without asking for confirmation. I don't think it is unethical, but here goes - 

I don't take any work calls after work hours. I let them go to voicemail and then listen to the msg. 

If the msg sounds like they had called me for a really important thing that can't be done without my help - I will call back and try to help them, if it won't take too much of my time.

If the msg says ""hey call me back, asap"", I'm like fuck off. Call me again and leave another voicemail telling me the topic.

If they didn't leave a voicemail - it wasn't that important then. ITT a lot of “non-unethical” LPTs 

You’ve made me so PROD fellow mitron!! When someone says shit like ""main tujhe dekh loonga"", ""main sabko bula ke laaoonga"", best answer is ""jo karna hai kar lena"" or ""theek hai"". We Indians have a tendency of talking big even if we are penniless ( gaan$ mein dum nahin,hum kisi se kam nahin)

AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Otaku (and otherwise) of /r/India, what anime are you watching and why do you like it?",17,am16yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/am16yk/askindia_otaku_and_otherwise_of_rindia_what_anime/,47,"I love anime. I think I can speak for many when I say that it's what I turn to when shit gets dark. Looking back over a decade, I can see that as long as I've been depressed I've had some anime to turn to on the side. 

I've never really become an Otaku though the last year has been tough and perhaps I've been on the path, as a NEET of sorts. Either ways, I felt there would be some here who would empathize.

One of the challenges of discussing anime is that everyone has their own personal list of must-recommends, and not many seem interested in your own lists. I guess it's like YouTube, everyone has their space and curations.

I've just started watching EVA. It feels nice to go back to the 90s for a change. And while I always perceived this as a 'weeb' anime for some reason, I watched a few YouTube videos on why people love it and realized it's sort of about depression as well. Four episodes in and I can see how compelling this show is.
 
The last anime I fell in love with was Samurai Champloo (which introduced me to Nujabes and the genre that evolved to become Low Fi). I watched that show for the music and the smooth storytelling. I wanted to be like Mugen - badass hardened street rat who's seen the world and is wise to it. But also like Jin, someone who has a deep inner calm. And a bit like Fuu, who creates the adventure, and who knows it's about the journey over the destination.

Starting a thread for people to talk about the anime they watch and how it makes them feel. Like, for example, why do you watch shonen anime - and do you feel it's inspired you to make your lives better?

More than plot and animation, I think anime does something for people's souls.",EverydayGravitas," Loved Tokyo Ghoul for a very unique story line,Death Note took me to a different level , recently watched Goblin Slayer and I must say loved the hero.
Big fan of Hellsing too.
 
Liked Rage of Bahamut Virgin soul,Konosuba too

Currently downloaded Tensei shitara slime Datta ken. Yet to watch. Hate the romantic ones. Love the ones with adventure and fantasy in them.

 Hentai

Why? Why not? Favorite Animes in no particular order:

Initial D
Hellsing
Naruto
Bleach
Evangelion
Rah-Xephon
Trigun
Samurai Champloo
Cowboy Bebop
Rurouni Kenshin


Currently watching: One Punch Man Patiently waiting for season 2 of one punch man. Rewatched hunterxhunter recently.  Currently I am exploring slice of life animes. Why? .. 
I like seeing cute girls doing cute things. I have only watched death note, your name, grave fireflies, spirited away. If any other anime is better or even comes close to these ones please let me know coz i  tried watching code geass felt asleep in 1st episode I rewatched Noragami recently to celebrate the manga getting new chapters again lol. It’s such a chill, cute, funny and sometimes really badass anime. I love all the characters in the show so I keep going back to it.
I understand you, though. Anime helps me get through stuff too. Things will be better soon. Just keep believing in it. Just finished watching Violet Evergarden it's the best anime of 2018 for me. Ghost in the Shell and Psycho-Pass 1 are my favorite anime period. One piece is an all-time favorite.

Nujabes was a great artist loved his songs - lady brown, aruarain dance, feather.

&#x200B; Watch/read black clover. Its ver interesting and a fast pacing anime  Started cowboy bebop yesterday.. 8 episodes in. BOI, it's fascinating how I didn't like it 5 years ago ditched it after first episode and now Im loving it and excited to finish it.  Gintama. It has always been my favorite. Started watching 'Hajime no Ippo'. I am not really into boxing or sports but this anime is amazing!  Mob psycho season 2. Before it the last anime I completed was bleach. All are isekai,


Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken - Started it out as I learnt the mc is a slime and powers similar to Kirby. 
Boy i absolutely don't regret it. The most fun wholesome anime I started to like and eagerly wait every Monday for next episode. Pacing is a bit slow but I still love it.

Sword art online 3 - Watching it since SOA1 well love the mmorpg concept and now loving the epic animation quality. Though mis the action in the latest season hopefully the action gets better.
.
Overlord(completed)-Enough heroe animes time for some villainy. Never knew I could watch and enjoy this. Animation quality ok but sorry wise fun and interesting. Couldn't wait for the future seasons so started reading the light novel.

Waiting for the latest season of my hero academia. Not really depressed or NEET, but I like anime. Currently watching Konosuba, Mob Psycho 100, Dororo, Boruto. My favourite is always the one I am currently watching Finished watching Castlevania a couple of days ago. Wish there were more episodes though. Trying hard to watch Mob Psycho 100 S2 and Hajime No Ippo. But I guess my love for anime has withered with time. Watch Yuru Camp for maximum comfy. Warning: You may not want to come out of your warm blanket anymore. Animes and games cover most part of my life... Currently watching MHA season 3... After this will watch Tokyo ghoul : re....

Cleaning our feet before entering someone’s home.  uh, I dunno about the rest of the world but I'm kind of glad that we can wash instead of using tissues after we go looloo  Saving money for rainy days.  Chai Aversion to wastage. 

We buy reusable stuff, smaller portion sizes and upcycle everything we use. A lot can be told by comparing dustbin size of a household of 4 here vs. household of 4 in US :P

Some of it came due to socialist economy and general scarcity. But I know of quite a few wealthy people who live a luxurious life but still don't like wastage and are frugal in consumption. The fact that we are surviving as a nation (for now). Historically we were never a country. The Maratha's spoke a different language than the Tamilians, Kashmiri people looked different than the ones from Nagaland and Gujrati people ate different food than the Odia people.

We went through a tonne of tests by fire after our independence. There was the Babri demolition, Kargil war, Mumbai attacks and most recently the Kerala floods.

The fact that our nation can support a minority of free thinkers (Yes I'm aware of the recent arrests). I view these people as the parallel culture within the country.
Even after the Lankesh and Dabholkar murders I personally knew people who were outraged. No matter how handful the minority is.. it does exist.
It seems like a bullshit point to mention this parallel culture but this is what is keeping a little hope burning inside me.
The most recent example I came across was the Kerala relief thread on r/India. I honestly got emotional reading the thread.. Where a guy donated a significant amount to the floods..
I'm not saying we are better or worse than anyone for doing so. I'm just pointing out the fact that there is at least a handful of people who are enough to spark some hope.

sometimes I wonder about the decisions that were taken by those who built the nation.
When Sardar Patel and Nehru fought to include a lot of independent territories in India. Or when Bhagat Singh stood at the gallows,  Or what went on Pritilata Waddedar's mind when she attacked the cafe..
We could've ended up in dead end chaos,but I sense that we are not there yet.

We might fall out of line some day, we might disintegrate into really really small nations that will be at war for eternity.
But I trust the parallel culture to find a way through. Friends, Family and strangers all are intent to help you. Also, if you do good, people around you appreciate it. Gotta love that

Not once do I ever feel awkward asking anyone for his phone to call or for time. Never has asking someone directions made me uncomfortable. Also, they take a personal interest in giving you the right directions to any place. 

Old people rock if you talk with them carefully and give an interesting turn on things. 

Interest parents take in their kid's studies is also something I admire The way Indians drink water from a bottle. We dont touch our lips with the bottle so that anyone can drink it.

Attention to detail when creating Reddit threads.  Dental hygiene: rinsing mouth after eating food.  Taking care of family.  Eating with your hands, You have total control over the portions that you are putting into your mouth compared to having food with a fork/knife/spoon where the portions are too less or too much . Some of the negative traits outlined in the other thread have a positive flip-side.

E.g.: Lack of privacy = Always having somebody to talk to. 1. Eating with hand, everything.
2. Managing chaos of life.
3. Adjusting everywhere.
4. Generally helpful if asked nicely. Not that other don't but. I feel Indians are hungry to if someone treat treat nicely or ask.
5. Genuine smile, specially in rural areas.
6. The Great Engineer in every family who have Jugaad for everything. Sharing, and mehmaan-nawaazi. Leaving shoes outside the home The ability to go anywhere on the planet and adapt to the environment. Also the ability to take our castes, religious bigotry and hatred to foreign shores. I was raised to help someone no matter what condition you were in. 

Also, no foot ware inside home and using hand to eat food. 
Spoon is good and all, but eating with your hand makes you conscious of your hygiene.  Saving our money! India is a very savings oriented country compared to Western nations which are more consumption oriented. We can excel in chaos, because we live in chaos all our lives. We're so used to things being non systematic. 

1. when we're late, we can rush and not panic and do things quickly, because we're so used to that. we're in rush all the time. 

2. we can drive in Indian traffic. its not an easy thing to do to go through the traffic which doesn't follow any rules and is more like brownian motion. 

3. we study a day before exams throughout college life, we know how to deal with deadlines and know how to prioritise things. Real life is more like that, having to excel at some of those chaotic times, and less like the American or other education systems where you continously perform at a moderate level. 

4. Our relationships are also chaotic, you marry a family, not a person. There are responsibilities from all sides, managing them is not as simple as in other countries. 

I can't think of more points but I'm sure there are many, we live in perpetual chaos, and can excel in chaos better than others. 
 *complement  नज़रों की शर्म। We have developed the food culture properly.  We take serious efforts to make our food tasty with Masala etc. The western people just eat that in basic form(meat with basic spices) .  We are doing it better.  Forming genuine friendships and relationships with the people around you. 


I think we do it better than the other countries, most of us probably have friends as good as family.   Reverence to books. A sense of family that makes us happier than we have any right to be given our economic and social situation. Philanthropy.



But in a narrow way  The way we treat other people. (I know there are horrible incidents now and then). That sweetness will melt your heart. There are some absolutely super niceness with all Indians.  I really can’t think of any. I feel terrible!

But on the other hand people living in India itself seem to give zero shit about following any traffic rule whatsoever. I have even come across people who on being asked to put on the seat belt reply with 'There's no traffic police in this area, so it's alright'

Isn't the entire point of having traffic rules to avoid accidents and major delays in transportation? And yet everyone seems to be completely oblivious to this and then start cussing at random people with their arse seated in the car wondering how it happened in the first place. Literally no one is exempt from this phenomenon - rickshaws tuck themselves in everywhere, bikes try to slip between vehicles, almost all car owners leave little to no space between consecutive vehicles.

No one seems to grasp the concept of staying in their own lane, if people were caught breaking the signal or speeding above the allowed limit everyone would get stopped one by one - it's just a crazy shit show. I have had several occasions where I had to personally point out to the traffic police themselves that vehicles are breaking the red light while I was crossing the road. Am I really expected to be okay with this?

You can say that many youngsters are to blame, but I don't see any elder people following a lot of rules either. It's only when someone goes through a major accident themselves, even after which they will follow only certain rules selectively so as to avoid harm to self.

I am looking for a more constructive answer than 'Because you can bribe the traffic police' I am also not looking forward to any of those 'You need to man up' bs comments. This is an entirely separate topic altogether.",beyond9thousand," > Is there any particular reason as to why Indians are so cautious when it comes to breaking traffic rules when they go and live abroad?

Enforcement. No way to bribe out of the situation. The fines at some places can be very expensive. You could lose your license. And Indians don't want to screw up their cushy life and get deported :P  Multiple reasons  
  
- Minimal punishment - The lowest traffic fine is just Rs 100 and it's the same for most of the common traffic offenses. This is just a little more than the cost of a litre of petrol. A person who owns a vehicle can surely afford to throw that money away, if caught (which so happens to be once in a while). The fine should be something that leaves a big dent in one's pocket. I believe the traffic fines should be made at least 10x the current amount so that people think twice before breaking a rule.  
  
- Corruption - As if the low fines weren't enough, people bargain with the cops and make the amount even smaller. I recall reading somewhere that a college student was on his way back from an exam and all he had was his hall ticket and pen. He had no helmet and no money and the cop took his pen. I was once caught speeding at 57 kmph (50kmph is too low a limit on the empty sections of bangalore ORR) and the speeding ticket was 300. The cop said he would let me go if I gave him 200 (and later came down to 100) without the ticket, but I insisted on the ticket. After a stern look he printed the ticket and voila, along with speeding came dangerous driving and rash driving. I reported this to the *socially active* bangalore traffic police on twitter/FB and even tagged various traffic DCPs, but there was no response.  
  
- Poor enforcement - The number of vehicles on the road are significantly more than what the traffic cops can monitor and keep tabs on, especially in metros. Many a time, the cops just let people get away with it because stopping them would disrupt the flow of traffic and cause big jams. This happens a lot in Bangalore.   
  
- Lack of infrastructure - The resources available to monitor and fine the people are very minimal. There are few speed detectors here and there, but they are also limited in the sense that they can fine only vehicles registered in that state. Some junctions have cams installed to check for various traffic offenses, but hardly do anyone get fined. Even after fines are issued through these, there's no way to monitor that people are paying these fines, until they are caught in person. There was an incident last year where a guy was caught with traffic offenses amounting to over a lakh. He was doing 140+ every day on the hyderabad ORR.   
  
- Ignorance and chalta hai attitude - Many people don't even know what the traffic rules are. They just see what others do and do that. At a red light, all it takes is one guy to jump, and a lot of them would follow. Many of them don't have driving licenses or just paid the agents to get a license for them without taking a test etc.   Indian licenses usually don't allow indians to live and drive abroad. They work for small trips, but if they want to drive for a longer term, they have to finish the theory and driving tests abroad. I'm actually going through this right now.  

The biggest issue with Indian driving is just education, and that is exactly what is fixed when people live abroad.  Who's gonna tell it to us? Driver training and licensing is a morbid joke in our country. We lose millions of our brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, friends and family members, all because we give tools to apes without training them first.

There are hundreds of driving schools all over the nation, but what do they teach? 10 days or 15 days is enough for you to know how to handle a vehicle, not nearly long enough to know how to handle the vehicle safely with thousands of other motorists on the road. Lack of enforcement basically. We have some of the best laws in the world but almost non existent enforcement. 

 Most Indians are oblivious to most other rules in their own country - why should traffic rules be an exception? Because it's extremely easy to get away with breaking them. What do you mean ? Everyone breaks traffic signals everywhere. ",2019-02-25 03:43:56
AskIndia,[AskIndia] My passport renewal application got flagged for RPO inquiry because I missed the police verification 10 years back. What problems that I am looking at?,63,aoq0pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aoq0pr/askindia_my_passport_renewal_application_got/,16,"I got my passport on tatkal 10 years back. But before the police verification could be done I had to fly abroad. We did not have the verification after I returned back to India and eventually I completely forgot about it. I also never saw any notice being sent to me about this. I traveled multiple times in the last 10 years but never had an issue at the immigration desk at airport.

Few days back I went for renewal with no address or name change. It seems it got flagged because of the verification issue and now I have to visit RPO next month.

What kind of issues that I might face? How do I prepare for this inquiry? Is there a possibility that my passport may be denied? ",blrbud," Doubt anything serious will happen. You perhaps will have to do a fresh police verification this time. 

Source : My ass, but that's the most likely scenario. Something similar had happened to me. It wasn't a big problem, I had to give a letter stating that due to some personal exigency I couldn't get verification done last time, kind of like an apology letter and they said that passport this time will only be issued after verification is completed. I had to wait like 10 days to get the passport.  Don't know what will happen but be very polite to the officers there even if they annoy you. Had same thing. I was apparently issued regular passport without police verification and it was caught during the final step of the renewal application process. 

The officer who reviewed the application asked to write a letter about my whereabouts for last 10 years and asked me to get a sign from the Assistant Passport Officer who was the head of that PSK and get it scanned and added to my file from a TCS employee. I went in to APO's office and explained the situation, he signed the letter without any further questions and asked me to explain to police the same thing if they ask about it. The police didn't ask during verification and I was issued passport just fine. take a good lube when u go to the RPO next month. one never knows. Passport office have some very senior and honest people. personal experience with New Delhi passport office, just be polite and don't try to use jugaad. Since sushma swaraj, passport is taken very seriously, so keep your paper in order and be present there.  Fresh police verification will happen. This has happened with me too. I got a letter from RPO and it appeared to have a mild threat that my passport may be revoked if my police verification isn't done. I had to visit RPO and get a new verification initiated for myself. 
I had to write apology letter something (those people with type writer outside RPO took 100 rs or so and wrote it). Take enough money with you to pay a fine if they impose one. Should be a couple of thousand atleast.  Show them a couple of pink notes. It'll get the job done. /s",2019-02-09 14:58:23

AskIndia,[AskIndia] I found out that one of my friends is an Heroin addict. How can I help,71,a8ipdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a8ipdj/askindia_i_found_out_that_one_of_my_friends_is_an/,32,"I received the information that he has become addicted to Heroin and Tramadol. He also mentions that one of his veins broke; can't recollect it now but it appears to be one of the major veins that starts from thigh and runs all the way down the leg. I don't know anything about what I've written. I am just an occasional user of weed, mostly home grown in my backyard.

I've received this information about him in an email. He's a long lost friend of mine, a good one and he reached out to me as it appears he's all alone now and even his family disowned him.

I am planning to meet him in person shortly and see what I can do. Can you guys help me?

First time I've joined this sub, I do remember seeing de-addiction section on the right but I don't now. Can you guys tell me what it entails? Hospitals/Rehabilitation centers, duration of treatment, approximate costs. It would help if it's in WB OR AP (Vishakhapatnam/Hyd/Vijaywada/Tirupati or even Chennai).

I've seen in one of the episodes of ""Homeland"" the protagonist is administered an African herb called ""Ibogaine"" and according to the show he was able to recuperate quickly. Any information on this also helps. I am mostly planing to bring him to me through the treatment unless he has any specific objection. If possible I am not averse to flying him to any place (i.e. if it's in Africa) that can offer some radical treatment.

Am a bit short on time atm. Need to run few errands. Can you guys help in anyway of information? Thanks.",UUUU__UUUU," heroine addicts are too dangerous to handle when they dont receive their dose. be careful. there should be rehabs in Vizagapatam and it is best to meet a psychologist for the same. Take him to a rehab center. Heroin isn't an ""aadat""; you need professionals to de addict [deleted] Go to a psychiatrist asap and then check him into a deaddiction center. Stay away from private ones as they often unlawfully detain patients and use torture. Also since you are not a family member it might be difficult for you to seek treatment for him. It would be better if he has a family member to accompany him. Consent for treatment has to come from him unless court mandated.

Good luck I don't know your education qualification. And if it's not doctor, please do not try to use any of the alternate medicines. Specially **Ibogaine** it's an hallucinogen and psychoactive. If you don't know what other drugs, he has taken it could do non-reversable damage to him. Yes Ibogaine has some deaddiction properties, but for that you need someone with proper training to administer it. 

Here's are the few steps you can take now:

1. Contact Doctor if government hospital, it would be best. (Other redditer or Doctor from here can help)

2. Inform his family.

3. Do not try to handdle this situation alone, take someone with you. As addict tend to get violent and emotional. 

4. Do not be a doctor and give anything that is suggested on internet. 

5. Tell everything to doctor. Tell doctor what kind of coktail he is taking, as well as how much dosage and duratin he has been taking.

Like others has said. Don't give money:



P.S- Keep us updated.

Edit: Formatting Like any addiction. Most of the addictive behavior is due to social problems. With Heroin it's a bit different but still the same. However the potency of heroin to hock users is very strong. What your friend needs is a safe and welcoming environment, people to talk to, a job to keep him occupied, He needs to be placed under constant supervision. Build trust with him. Consult a doctor to get him on buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone. If you want to help him be there for him most addicts start using because they see no hope in real life and Heroin becomes a good escape. The euphoric high they get is something that will keep forcing the person to go back aka chasing the dragon, hence he needs to be occupied all the time. Most heroin addicts will relapse if left alone so get him surrounded with people people who don't talk about using heroin. 

It is very tasking if you take up this job but as a true friend you should reassure him that if he is willing to quit you will stand by him always.  https://deaddictioncentres.in/rehabcentre/green-valley-foundation/

Check above site and maybe call some of them to find out what they have. I heard about Ibogaine in some podcasts (Joe Rogan/Aubrey Marcus), I think there are some centers in Mexico but no idea about anything in Africa.  >veins broke

Not an issue, it is manageable.

>family disowned him

Most probably because he asked them again and again for money, and eventually they had to disown him.

>deaddiction

What is basically done is, that the patient is given weak opioids which prevent full withdrawal and then these are tapered off. This can't be done with heroin, other stuff is used. And also in the meantime the patient is kept somewhere he can't get cocaine/heroine.

>ibogaine

No such thing in this world. There's nalaxone, which is used to save lives in case of acute heroine overdose, and naltrexone, used to help in rehab.

Also your friend may need good nutrition, addicts don't eat well.

  
 Asha Hospital in Hyderabad is an option, it’s a psychiatric hospital also help with addictions. We admitted my cousin there for some mental help, and I’ve seen their facilities, they looked impressive. Maybe call them and check.  this reminds me the plot of 'resolution'. Same scenario to be honest.

I hope your friend gets well though. Uska dealer kon hai Radical treatment centres can be found in Africa.  But they are literally radical and involve physical discipline and borderline torture if not torture. If will probably get him rid of his addiction but he may be scarred.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Multilingual people of r/India: What do you think is the easiest and most difficult Indian language to learn?,23,a79xl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a79xl0/askindia_multilingual_people_of_rindia_what_do/,45,"Saw that post by the white girl and I thought I'd ask.


I understand that most of us will only speak languages spoken in our states, but I'm sure there are some of us that have more different perspective.",CaptainPoverty," Mallu here... Can speak hindi, marathi, bengali and telugu.

Malayalam and Tamil are very difficult. Marathi would be relatively easier for a native Hindi speaker - very close alphabets, almost the same. I am reasonably fluent with Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Hindi. So I can reasonably follow a conversation in most parts of India. Except Kerala. Malayalam is somehow beyond my reach. Native Bengali speaker here. Can understand spoken Odia without any issues, clueless on the written part. Assamese shares the same script as Bengali, so can understand written Assamese. Spoken Assamese is pretty hard to follow for me. I'd say these two will be the easiest languages for a Bengali to learn. Due to substantial exposure from North Indian immgrants, knowledge of Hindi is pretty common too. 

The languages I'm fluent in, in the order of fluency are Bengali, English, Hindi. Can speak Kannada, Tamil, Telugu & Hindi. Also can understand Malayalam, which is definitely the most difficult to learn. Easiest can be a bit of miss or hit. Its easier for Kannadigas to learn Telugu and Tamilians to learn Malayalam and vice-versa. Easiest Gujarati. Most of us have a fair bit of idea already and it is similar to Hindi. 

According to pronunciation, as far as my knowledge goes Marathi is the toughest. Some of the letters are unique to it (even though it shares most of Devanagari with Hindi)


PS I speak Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati and English. And a little bit of Spanish  Odia here. Grew up in north India and find Hindi to be the easiest one. Can understand and read Bengali fluently without having put any effort. Pretty okay when it comes to speaking. Can understand a bit ofTamil and I think ot is the hardest one though there is still a lot of sanskrit in there tamil, its a totally different family language, if you learn hindi other north indian languages should not be too difficult Santhali, Kurukh, Ho, Khasi. It really depends on what languages you already speak. If you're fluent in an Indo-European language, it will be easier to pick up other Indo-European languages than it will be to pick up a Dravidian language. And vice versa. 

For instance, the most common challenge for native speakers of Dravidian languages is that Hindi does not have a neutral gender. Everything is male or female. Plus, verbs change based on the object's gender. It takes a lot of rewiring to get used to that. I speak Punjabi, hindi, bengali, telegu, English, French, and marwadi. Easiest to learn for me was Marwadi (school friends) and hardest was Telegu.  Native Tamil/Telugu Can speak German Kannada 
The only way to learn or speak Tamil fluently is by studying it at school or relegiously learning it an institute. Else it’s a hard language and again if you started working and there is no reason for you to write Tamil. It’s difficult to come back to the writing fluency, cause writing and speaking and literally two differing languages. All of them are difficult! If you picked them up as a child, it's fairly easier. As an adult, learning a new language sometimes puts the brain in an overdrive. Why do many find Malayalam difficult? It doesn't even have conjugations unlike other Dravidian languages. Ex-Moose here who was born in North India. I understand and speak Hindi and Urdu and can read both of them but cannot write Urdu because of lack of practice. If I practice enough, I will be able to do that. To make even worse, my Urdu vocabulary is non-existent.  


My neighbors were Bengalis and I don't feel Bengali is tough enough to not understand if you know Hindi/Urdu. Same with Marathi as one of my roommate was Marathi in the first year of engineering.  


Also. I spent 4 years in South India and didn't learn any Dravidian language. They are tough but my ignorance to learn the language was the main barrier for not learning it.",2018-12-18 18:28:44

""Where is your native place""

""Where are you from?""

These are common questions but I have no answer to it. I grew up in a different country, had my schooling in a different city, have my parents from two different parts of Kerala and have my (recently) permanent address in a different city.

I could say I am from the city I live in and have my family home in, but I've not lived here more than a year and know nothing about it. I could say I'm from the city I was born in , but again, I know nothing about it. When festivals happen here, I see them for the first time. I don't have any local friends.

I could say I am from the metropolis that I spent the largest chunk of my life in but then I am not Kannadiga.

I could say I am from the foreign country I grew up in and had my childhood from but then LOL that country doesn't give anybody citizenship. And I don't want it even if they paid me for it.

The more I think about it, the stranger the question of where you're from becomes, if you, like me, have no fixed roots. Where are you from if your parents come from two different cities? Where are you from if you spent many years in Bangalore but feel no affiliation to one city over another? Where are you from if you don't speak the local dialect and language of the place you are from?

",UngilUndy," I just mention my permanent address. I don't consider it home but it's the easiest answer for people to understand and it's the right answer for legal purposes. This is a good one. There are always people who don't belong to just one place, more so these days, but this has been the case for decades, it's not that new a concept. So if you analyse the question a bit further - it's the motivation behind the question not the question itself - is what we should be looking to answer.

If the question is nice and curious ""Where are you from"", and it's because the person asking is warm towards you and want to know you more - and of course that's probably for them to find ways to relate to you closer, and to you know, to get along better. In that case, you should answer what works best. 

Lets assume your parents are from Palakkad, you grew up in Dubai, and then lived for a while in Kochi, did university in Chennai and living in Bangalore. If a guy from Karnataka asks you where you are from, you should say your background is Kerala but you have been living elsewhere. If the guy asking the question is from TN, emphasis your background is Kerala, but you lived in TN. If the guy asking the quesiton is Malayalee, answer is kinda same, but you can be specific, that you are from Palakkad but been living elsewhere most of the time. The culture at your home is probably what you are culturally / background-wise - and that's probably what your parents brought with them. But for everything else, you are flexible - you are good person with a lot of life experience and can relate to all types of people and backgrounds. It's a good thing. You NOT poorer by not having a set place, but you are richer because of your various life experiences. From here around is my answer if anyone asks. ~~^(dehli se hu bhenchod)~~ I'll tell you some of my own details to help you determine where do you actually belong from.

&#x200B;

My father is a Bengali. Native : West Bengal. I did my schooling from Mumbai, graduation from Kolkata, Post graduation somewhere in the North (anything beyond Maharashtra is North FFS). So if anyone asks me where do I belong to, my answer is always I'm a Bengali but I permanently reside in Mumbai. So yes, you could mention it the same way. I'm a Malayali but I reside in XYZ city. So yeah I am a tiger from the terai grasslands located in the North eastern part of Modern day Uttar Pradesh .My habitat destroyed and my mates killed ,i will have my revenge in this life or the next . Home is where you live. You can say that you're from the metropolis you grew up in. If someone asks if you are a Kannadiga, just say no, I'm not. I’m guessing you grew up in the Gulf, based on your post. Same here. Was born in a random town in TN, grew up in the Middle East, attended college in TN and now I live in Pune. 

“Where are you from?” never fails to stir up a mini identity crisis. Where are you from? From where I lived since I was a kid till I become 20.


Doesn’t matter where I was born. Where I spent most part of my life matters in my case.  I usually say my parents are from ""enter name"" state but I grew up in ""enter name"" city. Simple. I have spent most of my life in metro but native place usually refers to your father's hometown (grandfather's home). My father had to shift to different cities every 5-10 because of job and we visit native place during festivals or special ocaasions only. I usually ask people if they have time for a drink, because it will take that long to explain. 

born in the gulf - oh so you're arab - no

parents from india - oh so you're indian - you could say that, but need a visa to visit my folks these days, and barely speak the languages

lived/worked in US - oh so you're american - i suppose, but no family or ties there

livingworking in Brazil - wtf are you doing here - just chilling bro.

Where are you from - somewhere on the planet is probably the closest answer. Wahin se .... I think this question goes back to where your ancestors are from. In the past _most families_ remained in the same geographical area so it was easier to answer. 

Now we have the nuclear family structure, freedom to travel so it's much harder to answer. Vishal, wassup bro?",2019-02-22 17:01:58
AskIndia,[AskIndia] Why is Math taught in India in a hotchpotch manner?,25,ahw9tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ahw9tx/askindia_why_is_math_taught_in_india_in_a/,22,"In USA, the Math education typically follows following sequence: Pre-algebra -> Algebra -> Pre-Calculus -> Single Variable Calculus -> Multi variable Calculus -> Differential equations -> Linear Algebra -> Other advanced Math courses.... 

It seems a pretty logical sequence of Math education to me, on the other hand, the Math education in India is divided on the basis of Class/College_year and topics from each Math subject are thrown in to make a soup of it. I think that studying a single subject in one go is much better than studying it in small chunks over many years. ",LongDraft," I remember it as slightly different, but comparable to the US methodology:

Basic Arithmetic and Basic Geometry in  Std. 1 to 4; basic algebra, slightly advanced geometry, introductory linear algebra in middle school with introductory statistics in Std. 5 to 8; trigonometry and introductory calculus, introductory probability and slightly advanced statistics with introductory matrix mathematics in Std. 9 and 10; advanced linear algebra, differentiation and integration, compound probability, introductory statistical distribution sets, irrational number theory in Std. 11 and 12.

This is for the ICSE board circa. 2004-2006.... The progression may have been there but our teacher never taught the why's of math. Probably because thats how they were taught themselves.  it was same as us when we were taught math. Because our education system is fucked and people who design the curriculum have their heads up their arses. Answers your question mate? since the concepts are closely related. its hard to differentiate between subjects.  I remember studing Math in pretty much the same order as OP has mentioned here. But what sucks in India is the quality of teachers. I remember hating math till 9th Standard, and I started liking the subject later on which I could attribute only to the change in the teacher.  > I think that studying a single subject in one go is much better than studying it in small chunks over many years.

This is debatable since there are memory retention systems which ape this staggered/split-up approach. 

Its a technique which is suggested by many experts. Not sure if Indian system was based on that intentionally but it ended up like that for a reason, probably practical/anecdotal evidence from the educators/board, etc.  It's the same here, what are you talking about? Everything in india is taught in a hotchpotch manner. 

We are, in many ways, an apathetic nation. Well, Indians are of the mindset learn maths even if you're not going to pursue it in future till 10th. We're taught basic of advanced maths which makes us like 'Jack of this trade'. Funny once when I asked what's the need of learning a particular topic from my teacher and he said, so you may be able to teach your children maths one day...

Anyways CBSE has reformed greatly in this department and from next session on, Maths section would be divided into [BASIC and ADVANCED for 10th standard students](https://www.timesnownews.com/amp/education/article/cbse-10th-board-exams-massive-reform-introduced-for-class-x-mathematics-2-levels-for-students-from-2020/345337) I'm a middle school math teacher in USA my school goes pre algebra, algebra, geometry, then algebra 2, then it is up to the student if they want to go into calculus and beyond when they get to high school",2019-01-20 18:11:28
AskIndia,Any blockchain developers here? Looking into getting into blockchain development [AskIndia],23,b3z818,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b3z818/any_blockchain_developers_here_looking_into/,12,"I am a full stack developer and seriously considering getting into blockchain development. I would appreciate any advice on how to get started in blockchain development, what are the current technologies that are being used in real world for blockchain, specifically Enterprise blockchain. I have seen videos implementing blockchains in python, node and solidity etc, but most of them are just proof of concepts and I am not sure if they are being used in real world. Any help is greatly appreciated.",FixMyEnglish," Currently there is not much material easily available online to learn about blockchain tech is what i felt. I had started to implement a simple wallet in nodeJS backend, react frontend. I was able to implement bitcoin litecoin and basic ether transfer for ethereum. I am on my way to learn solidity for creating smart contracts. 

If you want to learn basics, implement a bitcoin wallet and you will learn the basics. Move to ethereum then for learning about smart contracts then you can go for EOS. With the knowledge of these coins you will be highly valuable in the market. Interested! I followed [these](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFEVlZG2l2AUrWUXIJu5V1-TEElXZKYVH) tutorials to learn basics of block chain...
The second instructor is from IBM who has developed the HyperLedger Fabric Framework.
 Any reason why you want to get into blockchain? From everything I have seen and companies I have interacted with, blockchains have been a failure in terms of implementation and people are moving away from it. I know some of the largest companies in the world have not been able to really get value out of it and most people I know who have tried it have just burnt their hands. It is one of those over hyped techs that is still searching for a problem. Yooo happy that some people in india are actually interested to learn in new and upcoming technologies.

Okay for starters it's really difficult to learn this because there are no fucking proper courses or teachers and yes u will find a lot of proof of work concepts rather than legit products. It's a developing technology so yes it will be hard to learn about it.

Having said all that Blockchain still has potential because the big four accounting firms believe its potential for transactional and insurance purposes are way more secure than traditional systems.

Try learning about the R3Corda network. Many companies are trying to have a centralized version of a decentralised network verified by a ledger.

Also learn about the actual Blockchain core part rather than the crypto currency gimmick. I implemented a simple blockchain in Java a while ago. Sadly, not a lot of resources available to learn from:/",2019-03-22 09:59:07
AskIndia,[AskIndia] Tips for a new car driver?,60,a4gqaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a4gqaa/askindia_tips_for_a_new_car_driver/,62,"Bought an used car last week and I'm practicing my driving right now. Can I hear some tips for a new driver like me?

Also, what are some of the helpful accessories that I can get installed to make my driving experience fun and better?

I have a hyundai grand i10 magna (2017 model) if that helps.",dhildo," Since you are starting to drive, please make sure you are aware of your surroundings while driving. The more information you have, the better decisions you can make.

1. Make it a rule to check the mirrors before doing anything. (You know this but might still forget to do it. This should come as an instinct)

2. As one other guy said, use gear2 in intersections and speed breakers.

3. In slopes, while climbing don't increase your gear. Keep it as it is or lower it if need more pulling power at lower speeds. If you're stuck in a slope and need to move up, put 1st gear -> keep clutch point -> then move ( this will make sure your car doesn't come down)

4. In intense traffic, you don't need to use accelerator. In lower gears, keeping clutch point and releasing is enough for your car to move. ( You'll get used to using clutch point)

5. In the beginning, you will feel intimidated to overtake sometimes and get stuck behind vehicles or you'll stop so that someone else can join your lane, when this happens (or not) people behind you will spam horn, please ignore it. Once you get comfortable and confident, you can know your limits to make better decisions.

6. It takes time to get used to your car's dimensions. You won't know how much space to leave infront of your car to not get hit and it'll be difficult to know whether the left extreme of your car may/may not hit something. You need to know where your tires will be also. All these things comes with time no need to pay special attention.

7. Watch videos on what to do in case of emergencies. What to do when someone hits you?
What to do when your break doesn't work?
What to do when your accelerator gets stuck and is infinitely accelerating?
What to do when you got a puncture tire?
How to use your tool kit?
How to start a car when ignition doesn't work and someone has to push from behind?

8. Learn to use your headlights properly. Having high beam will practically blind the guy coming in the opposite lane.

9. Be aware of your left side. Since lot of folks will overtake you in the left (Which is not wrong in dual or tri lanes). People will cut into main road from side road without looking at anything. Be aware of crossroads in highway.

10. Don't make any sudden movements which might make someone else crash into you.

Lot of things are there but everything will come with practice and experience. Four years back my driving instructor told me ""you're worthless and it's no use teaching you to drive"" and here I am driving perfectly fine in all conditions ( intense traffic, crooked roads, highways, hills)

 Some tips from my experience: 

1. Wear your seat belt and make sure everyone in your car wears seat belts, even at the back. It may seem like a simple thing, but can save lives.


2. To practice driving, start out early in the morning (around 6 am) and drive in the city. Make sure you are perfect with driving in the city before you drive on highways. 


3. The most important thing in city driving is stay in the middle lane always. Only before a U-turn, change to the right most lane. So many experienced drivers make this mistake and always drive in the right most lane and suddenly change to middle lane at u-turns, causing traffic jams.


4. Don't be afraid to go out at night. Remember to always use low beams in the city. 90% of drivers use high beams in the city which blinds you at night. If possible, wear anti-glare driving glasses to counter this. 


5. Don't get bullied by tailgaters. People behind you sometimes force you to go faster by tailgating and honking. If you don't want to go fast, change lanes and let them pass. Never get angry at your fellow drivers, be calm. 


6. Always properly adjust your mirrors properly to eliminate blind spots before you drive. Don't set your outside mirrors for getting a rear view, adjust them for a side view. Use the inside mirror for rear view. 


7. Use your indicators even when you change lanes. Even when no one's behind you, don't skip the indicators when you turn. It must become a reflex. 


8. Always be prepared for what could happen in case of a minor or a major accident. Never flee the sight of the accident. If damages are big, go to the police, file FIR and claim your insurance. Don't fight with others. 


9. I don't want to be rude but 2-wheelers are the biggest idiots on roads for car drivers. Most of them don't look while turning and you must be extra careful around them. 

10. There's a rule of precedence for pedestrians. You should always let them cross the road first. 

Some useful car accessories: 

My must have accessories include mobile phone holder (if you use Google maps more), reverse parking sensors (with camera if you want to spend more), fog lights (especially if you live in the North), 12v phone charger, small trash bins that fit in door bottle holders.

Always keep a glass cleaner bottle, some microfiber towels, soapy water in your car. 
Make sure your windshield washer fluid is filled with a proper washer fluid concentrate.

Also buy a dashboard camera and a rapid tyre inflator. These are somewhat expensive but they will pay off every time you use them. 

edit: Tyre pressure is something we usually don't check or pay attention to. Always maintain recommended tyre pressure which can be found inside driver side door jam.
Always inflate your tyres when they are cold. 

Edit 2: Watch all videos in this channel, they helped me a lot. https://www.youtube.com/user/acomvillerayconduite [deleted] Always second gear when turning at intersection. Secret tip from my trainer some 10 years ago. 1. Even when you become a seasoned driver make sure never to overtake at turns. Wait for a straight path before you overtake. I have seen many people commit this mistake and the result is most likely very fatal.

2. If it seems there is a problem with your car, start the hazard lights and slowly keep going towards the left most lane. Whenever you think you are in a position where your car is a danger to you and others. Use hazard lights.

3. In India you will have to specially take care of bikers. They can emerge from anywhere. Also, if you feel there is enough space for two wheelers let them go else don't give them enough space.

4. Keep distance from trucks and never drive behind them if you have to maintain a larger distance then usual.

5. Don't accelerate very fast specially in traffic. Many a times such fast acceleration will lead to you bumping into the one infront of you or the one behind you will bump into you.

6. Invest in a dashcam.
 The following diagram shows two vehicles A and B. Traffic flow is from
the left of the picture to the right.

                                   Traffic Flow ->
       ===============================================
				  +------------+
				  |     A      |
				  |            |
				  +------------+
	    +---------+
	    |    B    |
	    +---------+
       ===============================================

You are the driver of B.
A is some other vehicle, and is stationary for whatever reason.

In this situation, do NOT pass A at full speed. Slow down and turn your head to the left to look for pedestrians crossing the road in front of A. Because of A, they would not have seen you before starting to cross the road, and many of them believe that the road is safe for crossing and do so with full speed and confidence.
 Always honk the hon on a blind curve. India is the land of morons who will try to overtake on blind curves. Also there are certain road etiquettes which you must know - [Team BHP](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/64236-road-etiquette-how-not-drive.html). Also learn what to do when somebody hits your car. If you drive in hilly areas, there are other [Rules](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/technical-stuff/13595-tips-required-hill-driving.html). Keep safety as your number one priority, always wear seatbelts. Just one advice, don't use high beams unnecessarily, and in cities they are not even needed mostly. I know how many times I have been blinded and have escaped accidents just because of this simple thing. Don't know exactly how comfortable you are. Here are some tips for beginners on Indian roads including some unconventional one.

1. On city streets, the *middle* lane is best. The left most lane is typically packed with parked cars, pedestrians, slow moving cycles etc. OTOH others can overtake you on the right lane.

2. On 4 lane street, drive **on** the center line. Forget about lane rules. There aren't any.

3. Never, ever take a turn from the middle lane/middle of the road. When you know there is a turn coming, get to the closest lane first. If you take a turn from one lane across (either to the left or right) someone is **guaranteed to crash into you**. 

4. Try to drive straight in a line. When you reach someone blocking you, no sudden turn. No sudden *movement* even in your own lane. Slow down. Check mirrors. Turn signal on. Then change lane.

5. The power of the 'L' marker. No one will blame you if you drive slowly in your lane. In fact others will appreciate it. Don't worry. As long as there is space, others will overtake you. They may honk once or twice. Don't bother. Of course you will be overtaken on both sides. So to repeat point 4, no sudden turn.

6. Just because you have turn signals on, doesn't mean you can swiftly change lanes. Change lanes slowly. So that anyone behind you get's some time to react.

7. On bumper to bumper traffic, where you are moving only by 1 meter per move, you don't need the accelerator. Keep in first gear. Just slightly release the clutch. The car will start moving. Hold the clutch again cut power to the wheels.

8. Practice parking. You will need some time to get a feeling of your cars size. See how close you can park to the curb. 

9. When parked, don't suddenly open your door. A cyclist will come out of nowhere and bump into your open door. Again, mirrors.

10. Practice hill start. Find a stretch of road that has a mild slope. Stop on the middle of the slope going uphill. Then start moving again without backsliding too much. You will **have to** learn this. 

11. Practice in wide city streets. Don't be afraid. Go in the early morning. Don't practice in narrow lanes near your house. Those are way more difficult for beginners.

12. I am not going into highway driving right now. Among accessories, parking cameras and mobile holders are nice. And an aux cable.

 First dont be on reddit if you are driving.. No blind overtakes = Multiple lives saved. 10 feet from next car upto 25 kmph
15 feet upto 40 kmph
20 feet upto 60 kmph 

Okay I made up those numbers but you get the gist... The distance between you and the vehicle you follow should increase with speed and the size of vehicle in front. Find open places near you to practice.

Feet should be position so that your heal is placed at the brake and you angle it sideways to accelerate. Your impulse reaction would be braking a d not accelerating.

Practice driving backwards it is something that takes most time to perfect and also helps you in parking once you have mastered it.

Understand the use of all the car mirrors. Mainly focus on various blind corners (behind the tail lights).

Try to gently move into a gear with your stick shift rather than forcing into a gear. Your gear box will remain fine.

Other things shall come with practice which won't be a prob coz you will drive a lot.  There are plenty of idiots on the road. Don't become one of them. Always be courteous and respectful of others on the road, even if you happen to cross paths with an a** hole. One day, someone else will return your respect and that day you will be thankful for being a gentleman. Follow best practices on the road and keep yourself, your family and others safe. Always remember driving a car does not make you invincible. Go through the Q & A in the following link:

[http://transport.telangana.gov.in/html/llr-question-bank.html](http://transport.telangana.gov.in/html/llr-question-bank.html)  1. Beware of 2 wheelers. Bikers and scooty folks will merge suddenly from left.
2. On traffic signal, don't stop in middle of cars in a way that there is space on both side of your car. Bikers will try to squeeze and scratch your car both sides. Stop closing space left or right side.
3. Get a dashcam.
4. Assume there is always someone in blind curve. Sometimes its driving in wrong direction.
5. Get polaroid with minimal shade. They handle beams of others car very well.
6. Let rash drivers go if they are trying to overtake you. Blocking them increases their insanity at the moment and they drive dangerously.
7. Drive safely even if someone is blowing horn behind you to push you. There was a similar question asked twelve days ago. You might find some useful tips there: [https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a0kmka/learning\_driving\_from\_tomorrow\_what\_are\_some/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a0kmka/learning_driving_from_tomorrow_what_are_some/) Slow down but do not go off the road if an oncoming vehicle is approaching in front of you (driving on its wrong side).

Assume that everyone on the road is an idiot except for you. Anticipate them to make the worst possible moves and drive accordingly. * Practice parking at home a lot, become a pro at parking, so that when you find spaces in the real life, you can do it in a matter of seconds. I've seen so many people owning cars for years who can't park properly and will keep struggling for 15 minutes. Practice all common scenarios, especially parallel parking, and also perpendicular parking. Always park in reverse. Look at some youtube tutorials.

* Learn about the blind spots of your car right now. You should know the limitations of your view. The most important one is the blind spot on right ORVM, and then left ORVM.  Don't use your hand as indicators.  Here is an actual tip to help you learn better. While you're learning to control your car engine / clutch and breaks. Start by using them without shoes / sandles on. Driving barefoot or with socks on will help you understand the vibrations and feel of the clutch, accelerator and breaks way better. Whatever car you use. This also helps you adjust to new cars faster  . Please learn to use the upper/dipper lights properly. 


. I have the same car, it can squeeze through traffic easily. Don't do that. It just worsens the situation for everyone. 


. Respect zebra crossing and avoid lane changing without indicators. 





About accessories, I had changed my horn as nobody moved to the stock horn. 


How much did it cost second hand?  When my parents taught me to drive, they'd always say - any idiot can drive fast, it's being able to drive at slow speeds, up hills and in stop and go traffic that takes skill. 

Like many have said, learn to use the handbrake+accelerator to climb up a hill. Given our traffic, that will come in very handy. 

 One simple advice which has stuck in my head: ""while driving, don't be nice. Be predictable""  There are a lot of legally correct dead people. Even if you're following all the rules, be aware of others on the road. Your respect for road rules aren't gonna ensure your safety when others are being reckless. Always wear seat belt. most of car damages while taking reverse, please take care of that (if you dont have rear camera) And all of the points are covered by previous users. Something my dad tells me: A good drivers uses his brakes. A bad driver uses his horn. This doesn't apply to blind curves though. :)

&#x200B;

Also, something I learnt on my own: Do NOT use your clutch so much. You'll wear it out soon. It's a bit expensive to replace. Team BHP has plenty of resources on this topic. Some I like -

Get a dash cam the good one Invest in a dash cam.  How much did it cost? Just want to know Overtake when you've clear vision. Use low beam in cities & high beam on highways. Switch between high & low when you do not have clear vision during nights. This will also helps the other rider to understand whether you're giving a way or overtaking.

Always use indicators while changing lanes during day & night (especially).

",chaprasibabu," Relevant story. 

My bestfriend was working for a tech giant (hint :- Anti national online shopping) and he met this girl who seemed like any other random girl you come across at workplace. 

Anyways, they both started chatting casually over WhatsApp, and she was on a leave for a day or two, so my dude casually texted to check on her which went on deaf ears of her. She comes to the office next day and raises a complaint to the manager that he's harassing her for no reason, and upon checking her phone it sent shockwaves. She deleted all her chats (as in replies sent by her) to show that he was constantly texting her times and times. She even went as far as deleting her call logs which threw him in the bad light. Luckily, my dude had backup of all the texts/call logs so he stood his case and she was thrown out of the company. 

P. S. :- I forgot to mention that she urged him to delete all the chats/call logs the day she was on leave so that they can start afresh.  i faced this. had to resign since walmart is now a major stakeholder in my company If your company is willing to fire you on an anonymous complaint that too of something that supposedly happened years ago, you do not wanna work there. I would fire the whole HR department. My face is my defense. That should prove no females were involved with anything I did. I'm a nice guy. Sexual misconduct kelie bhi female contact prerequisite hota he. Mere paas toh vohi nahi he.ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ **I didn't do anything.**  


A newly hired female colleague reported me for a sexual assault to the company. Falsely. I, with explicit and multiple consents by the ways of asking her specifically , had went till 2nd base with her one day after getting a little drunk. She proposed me for a relationship. I refused. She got offended and decided she could just ruin my career for her ego. After all, she is permitted and now-a-days even cheered on, for doing it. Women are after all fragile, innocent and gullible creatures who are constantly assaulted by boys like me who are all, without any pre-judgement and as a matter of fact, savage monsters.

Company decides to terminate me within half an hour of when she approached them. No questions asked. No statements taken. Just informed of *the decision* 

Sitting at home and writing this while the parents believe I've taken work-from-home kind of arrangement for a month since I missed them so much that I travelled back 3000 kms to spend some time with them. And I wait for the end of this month when I'll receive a lousy severance-package kind of compensation thinking about what the actual fuck just happened to me, still in disbelief.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.",IAmMohit," #[**Part 2 of COVID-19 megathread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fkttm7/coronavirus_covid19_megathread_news_and_updates_ii/)

Please post new information in that thread. Guys pls share in your groups that it has nothing to do with chicken. Cases in Italy went from 3 to more than 200 in just three days and they're yet to find out how it all started. I'm skeptical about India having only 3 cases, I hope and pray that's the case. There's also no update on the virus here in 2 weeks.

I hope the government is taking necessary steps keeping this in mind and people are cautious and aware amid all this protests and the mess that the government has created. Wanna hear a fun fact? Uae closed down all schools for 4 weeks.


Despite this, Indian schools across the country are still holding their board exams. In this, 200-300 students are stuffed into halls with a meter of space between each student's table per each hall. 


That's right. 200-300 per school/Hall since students from many schools congregate in one hall


Sounds fun right? Well, an Indian school had a student with a case of corona. Oh, and the students at the exact age where one goes through these exams. Meaning that since he/she went for board exams.....

Creating an artificial sense of security by under-testing betrays the short-sightedness and lack of understanding of elementary psychology of the administration. 

Sorry for being an alarmist, but people NEED to be afraid. The current living generations haven't experienced anything like this yet. Read on twitter:

People, especially the poorer, will need very strong support from government and society to survive this economically. People coming back from corona hit countries are creating ruckus at T3, Delhi.

[It seems the US has begun animal trials of a possible vaccine.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-uk-vaccine-researchers-12423290) NO ONE has tested positive at Kolkata airport. That was false news . They are suspected cases and not confirmed. One other serious issue that no one is talking about is the board examinations and coming ""entrance examination season"". If a student or students are carrying the virus there's a probability that many students can get infected. Eventhough it's not a woresome situation now shouldn't the concerned authorities make certain decisions regarding the matter? . As we are in sorts of the preliminary stages isn't it necessary to be ready to take actions like postponing the examinations??. These examination centers and schools can be a place from which virus can spread like crazy. Just bringing this up as no one here seems to say anything about the matter. All over the world universities and schools are sending the students and teachers into an early spring break (according to the western school not the Indian ones). So if the virus transmission get going fast the people in charge should consider and answer the students.... It'd be better to suspend holi celebrations.. Government should make that statement may be. India temporarily suspends visas to France, Germany & Spain nationals

Incorrect. *Novel Coronavirus* disease named Covid-19.

Coronavirus is a generic term that refers to a group of virus, and they primarily cause respiratory disease (virus is a semi-living organism that hijacks a living cell to replicate itself).

Delhi’s first Covid-19 death confirmed. 69-year-old Janakpuri woman succumbs to the illness at RML Just so you all know China had the largest quarantine, about 60 million people were asked to stay inside their respective houses. Hence China has successfully overcome the adverse condition. Still few people are infected but it's not as bad as few weeks ago. This will mostly come down to whether people would listen to the authorities and be honest about their hygiene. I don't believe complete lock down is necessary but if it takes a complete lock down to fight this disease and stop it then it has to be done. It remains to be seen whether people would accept such strict measures, especially those who work in daily wage set-up and small scale businessmen. Stocks are utter shiat but conditions could get worse since America and European countries are pretty much getting screwed over. On top of that this is the exam season, exam halls can be a hive for disease transmission and this in turn can infect others as well.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-may-declare-emergency-as-america-shuts-down-amid-coronavirus-fear/articleshow/74617978.cms Does anyone think that the government is severely underreporting the number of infected people? Putting some deaths in perspective 

1266 people have died in Italy. 
Of the patients who died in Italy, 42.2% were aged 80-89 years, 32.4% were between 70 and 79 years, 8.4% were aged 60-69 and 2.8% were aged 50-59 years and those aged more than 90 made up 14.1%.

The mean age of the dead is 81 years. Out of all who died who were over 80, 2/3rd had existing heart and lung conditions ANI is reporting total number of cases in India is 93.

So is the ministry of health website.

Edit: Its 107 now The man found positive in Vashi, 59 years old, is a Philippines national, while the Kamothe resident (40) had travelled to Dubai with the group of 40, and the Kalyan patient, a 37-year-old, had travelled to France and the US.


Civic officials said all of them were undergoing symptomatic treatment at Kasturba Hospital. ""Everyone is confused about how to differentiate between the symptoms of Covid19, Flu and common cold. They all seem similar. We’ve put together a chart after sourcing info from @WHO

My guess is they're only reporting positive cases with travel history. Infection through community transmission aren't being tested and counted.

(15 Mar 2020 at 8:50 PM) I've been in India for more than 3 weeks. No symptoms. Canada suggested people to come back, but there are less people sick here in India than in Canada. I have really flexible dates and my visa is still valid for a while (since I am already in the country).

Should I stay here (Goa: not planning on moving around) or you think I would be safer out of India as a foreigner ? I feel like travelling would be against the point of limiting travels.

Edit: Before India (Feb 23rd) I was in Sri Lanka for a month.

Edit: Leaving the 18th, the travel insurance are covering it. Thanks to mostly all for the insights. [Shit that went down in Italy.

In light of this, can I ask if anyone knows about our supply of this drug? As it's a malaria drug and since we produce so many drugs, I'm sure India manufactures at least a reasonable amount of it, I'm just curious as to how much.

>**Is it possible the warmer weather may bring relief?**

Some observers have pointed to the fact that Africa has relatively few cases of Covid-19 and that this may be a response to hotter conditions there. The virus cannot take the heat, in other words.

Most scientists counsel caution, however. “The disease has only just arrived in Africa and it is far too early to tell how it will behave there,” says Woolhouse. “We will just have to wait and see.” Would you say it would be better to stop hitting the local gym or call fellow House Maids for Cleanup and Cooking and rather DIY or would you say it's too early and that would be an overreaction?

Together with 50+ volunteers, we have mapped the outbreak of the Coronavirus for more than 2 months (previously our map was on a different URL). But we are getting more and more cases and are having trouble with coverage.

* We need help with covering India and would like to ask you to join our fight in this.

Otherwise, you can also just use the map for browsing.

In India, there is not much spread as of right now, but the rate increases, the spread will go out of hand. So many students giving major exams like boards and upcoming entrance season; it will be a fest for easy transmission. We need to take quick steps if the spread rate increases. Schools must remain close, and other adequate measures should be adopted. > Kerala state health minister KK Shailaja said the fresh six cases include the aged parents of the three who arrived from Italy and residing at Pathanamthitta, who turned positive early this week.

So we are starting to see 2nd degree infection without direct travel history. I suspect we are not too far from mass community spread.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8112777/Italian-urges-UK-lockdown-amid-coronavirus-pandemic.html anyone know how much does the test cost in Delhi? What exactly happens when you go there? Do they  keep you in quarantine even if you don't actually test positive but only have the symptoms? every hospital in my locality and around gets full each year during malaria or seasonal outbreaks. People lie outside on floors, for weeks, and eventually gets treated- well because there is only one doctor. That too, if you are lucky. Many positions in hospitals are lying vacant. 

I wonder what would happen when Corona decides to give a visit here. [It’s high fever, dry cough and breathlessness, that you really really need to worry about.

2) Who conducts the tests? How many are being tested daily?

3) What are the local reports from doctors/nurses? 

I can see the general panic / outrage rising, and we may not trust the government numbers, but we do need good decentralized information to know what the situation REALLY is and how to deal with it.

I feel better when I hear first hand reports of Healthcare workers going around and checking in every household in some of the towns in Kerala - but I feel completely blind to the situation in the rest of the country. 4 new positive cases of coronavirus reported in Maharashtra: 3 from Mumbai and 1 from Navi Mumbai.

All children tested & quarantined for 2 weeks as a precaution](https://twitter.com/AmanKayamHai_ET/status/1234758069843660802?s=20) This busts a bunch of myths that I have seen people posting here:

> **Claim: ‘It is no more dangerous than winter flu’**

> Many individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But this week, a WHO expert suggested that this has not been the case with Covid-19. Bruce Aylward, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country’s response, said the evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.

> **Claim: ‘It only kills the elderly, so younger people can relax’**

> Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.

> **Claim: ‘Face masks don’t work’**

> Wearing a face mask is not an iron clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can still penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is the main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly five-fold protection versus no barrier. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re just walking around town and not in close contact with others, wearing a mask is unlikely to make any difference.

Again businessmen taking advantage of the people and the officials not taking adequate actions to prevent it. In China although in the beginning it was not taken as seriously as quite recently (they started to go ham around Feb and Jan ending although the virus was discovered around December) they contained it by providing all the people with free masks and gloves. The new reports say that around 95% of the spread was contained due to this action undertaken by the government. Although not adverse as china, the prices of the gloves and sanitizers must be reduced. It must be made available to all and also when selling masks and sanitizers their quantity must be regulated. Otherwise if people start buying and hoarding them then its stocks will finish up quickly and all the people won't get it.(I am facing the same situation as most of the pharmacies around my place has run out of the masks and sanitizers.). Also if you don't obtain N95 masks it's fine, just obtain that 3 ply makes for time being (if the shortage of N95 exist, it's not as affective N95 however it will work fine.). Also maintain your hygein and follow the standard procedure. Where I am, it's in pseudo-quarantine. Stay safe all... Worst time to get a cold huh. I am wondering how come only 34 cases in India so far??? Anybody have some idea???? All these warnings and people still don't obey anything. People are celebrating holi like it's completely normal in my university. There are large gatherings like conferences with people coming in from all over India.

A very good article explaining the possible cyclone we are heading into. One of the suggestions is to to really stay away from the elderly but not sure how possible it is in India. What I honestly believe, is thay India might be going down the path of herd immunity in at end because we don't have that much health infra to take care of everyone What is the current situation now in India? Will the situation escalate in one week or will it dying down and life will be back to normal? I’m struggling to understand how the Govt is making decisions of travel restrictions, bans on malls etc or how to proceed after March 31st if we aren’t testing cases properly. How do would they have an idea as to what phase of the spread we are in? https://www.umaryland.edu/news/arch...tial-spread-and-seasonality-for-covid-19-.php

Researchers at the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and the Global Virus Network (GVN) predict that the **novel coronavirus (COVID-19) will follow a seasonal pattern similar to other respiratory viruses like seasonal flu**. They base this on weather modeling data in countries where the virus has taken hold and spread within the community.

I'm  astonished at the ignorance of people saying India is doing really  well, because there are only fewer cases compared to other countries. To  get a real picture, compare the numbers of infected related to the  number of testings we have done. Look at this [table](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/covid-19-testing/).  It's 6 days older now. South Korea, a country that has half the  population of Maharashtra, has done more than 150.000 testings as of  now. Italy (population of 60 million people) has done almost 50.000. China has tested almost 500.000 people in Guangdong (population of 113  million people). What about India? No numbers.  I'm sure it's below 5000... So fucking low considering we share the border with the country this virus originated from.

I don't want to scare anyone, but this thing is going to explode really  hard in India without us even knowing. In fact, I'm 100% sure it already  is getting everywhere and anywhere. The only state in India with the  ability to tackle this issue is Kerala (and maybe Delhi). The rest of  India, especially states like UP and Bihar, will suffer beyond our imagination. Many people (mainly old poor people with no resources) will die and we'll never get to know if they had this virus or not.

There's only one positive thing in India regarding this virus: we are  population of relatively young people. Our immune system should be  strong enough to resist this virus, but what about our elders? This country is not ready for this shit. Our health system is not ready for  this shit. We are not ready for this shit.

And yes, I don't even want to talk about the impact it'll have on economy. It will make you suicidal. BREAKING: Spanish prime minister declares state of emergency due to coronavirus, puts country on lockdown

>Dr Tsering Angchuk, the Medical Superintendent in Sonam Norboo Memorial Hospital (SNM) in the city of Leh, received three patients he suspected of having contracted coronavirus in late January.

>One patient, a 54-year-old man from the village of Phyang, was admitted on January 27.

>“He was having breathing difficulties and running a high fever at the time of admission. All these symptoms fit with the criteria of coronavirus,” said Dr Angchuk.

>Dr Angchuk immediately sent a letter, seen by The Telegraph, to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) in Leh.

>The letter, titled ‘report regarding the patients who show coronavirus-like symptoms’, instructed that samples should be immediately sent to India’s only coronavirus testing facility in the city of Pune.

>However, the hospital authorities refused to send samples arguing it would be impossible for coronavirus to have infected anyone in Kashmir.

>The 54-year-old’s symptoms gradually worsened and he died on February 5. 

>The hospital authorities recorded that he suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis and died from pneumonia. However, the district tuberculosis officer in Leh, Dr Nurzin Angmo, said the deceased patient was never medically diagnosed with the disease.


>Misdiagnosis of the cause of death in India is extremely common and less than one quarter of deaths are medically certified, according to the Registrar General of India. 

>Speaking on condition of anonymity, health workers in Kashmir said the misdiagnosis of deaths was common and would extend to coronavirus.

>“We have never worked on that [medical certification] and hospital staff have never been trained to ascertain the correct cause of death,” an anonymous regional health official admitted.

>“You will see hospitals record the mode of death as a heart attack rather than its underlying causes like hypertension,” echoed an employee at SNM Hospital.

>“These incorrect methods can have implications on estimates of coronavirus deaths also.”

>Doctors believe the hospital authorities refused to send samples because they didn’t want to create panic but that an outbreak in Kashmir is only a matter of time, thanks to government inaction.

>Fearing inaction at his hospital could lead to coronavirus spreading, doctors leaked Dr Angchuk’s letter to the public. On February 27, the hospital bowed to public pressure and began admitting patients displaying coronavirus symptoms – 140 patients have since been quarantined and are awaiting test results.

The claim about there being no community transmission so far - the selection criteria for ministry states "" 

Case Classification*


Suspect case 

A. Patients with severe acute respiratory infection (fever, cough, and requiring admission to hospital), AND with 
no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND at least one of the following: 
 a history of travel to or residence in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in the 14 days prior to 
symptom onset,

 or 


 patient is a health care worker who has been working in an environment where severe acute respiratory 
infections of unknown etiology are being cared for. 
. 

B. Patients with any acute respiratory illness AND at least one of the following: 
 close contact with a confirmed or probable case of 2019-nCoV in the 14 days prior to illness onset, or 


 visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in the 14 days prior to 
symptom onset, or 


 worked or attended a health care facility in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms where patients with 
hospital-associated 2019-nCov infections have been reported.""



There is a clear selection bias in the sample. In simple words, if you test for only people who've had travel history/ contact with travel history or if you're a healthcare worker, we will treat you as suspect case, your entire sample will have only such people. You can't make a statement that there are no unconnected links without actually looking for them. 



The selection bias also extends to testing symptomatic patients ONLY. There is abundant data that there is asymptomatic transmission as well all across the world. These people are not being tracked or reported.

That's roughly the ratio they have seen in other countries that have been testing.

**Using this logic India has at least 750 infected people**. It is probably more because testing isn't as aggressive so far.

Their client is still not allowing it explicitly. He says they have got many emails from the client management addressed to all employees including the contractors in India - they have said everyone can work from home but this only applies to their own employees and contractors in USA. 

They are not even directly addressing the India team about their fate - my brother said after all with much distress and sadness - it seems Americans do consider their lives to hold the highest value and not anyone else working with them.

- At what stage of symptoms are you advised to visit a doctor? How high a fever for example?
- Where to get tested? Do all big hospitals have facilities to test for coronavirus? 
- What kind of doctor do you have to see? Do you just walk up to the reception of a hospital and ask for a coronavirus test? Italian tourist's wife tested positive for coronavirus at Jaipur Hospital.

[source ](https://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=682606) One of my colleague who travelled to SE Asia a month or so back was called by the authorities and asked to get a check up done at the hospital. He will go tomorrow. Small things like these restore my faith in our preventive measures. Our messwala who serves us food is coughing since 3 days i am really scared and hoping it will be normal cough. Students who got admits from US universities are getting emails to reconsider / nudging them to not attend Fall 2020 programs and apply for deferrals from the universities.. Hello, How do I react to finding out a friend is leaving on a vacation trip to Rajasthan with her family? Highest number of cases are there right? I am pretty sure she and her family will not self-quarantine after coming back. I have wished her Happy Journey and have asked her to clean her hands regularly and to stay away from crowded places. 

P.S:- We have canceled our own trip to udaipur next week, because we have immuno-compromised family elders.  With that in mind for me her trip seems neglectful of danger to her own family. Maharashtra has 10 Positives (8 from Pune, 2 From Mumbai)

https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ Any information whether they're postponing competitive examinations like JEE, NEET or HSEE. I am coming to India from Dubai to write HSEE in Kerala on 19th. Would I be restricted to the mandatory 14 day quarantine? https://youtu.be/nV0tQ1kllvY  

I watched the Press Conference by the Ministry of Health, here is the briefing:

-	There is **no Community Transmission**; all the cases that have been registered are cases of Local Transmission (only the family of the infected have been infected too). 
-	Masks aren’t necessary; self isolation and personal hygiene is a must. 
-	Ministry didn’t want to speak about the death in Karnataka. 
-	The Italians that are being tested with HIV+ drugs is just a experiment, the doctors tried it. The concerned authorities are studying the case.
-	No comments about doubling/tripling of cases: The authorities are focused on prevention, raising such question is speculative.

___

My opinions: 

-	I don’t buy the “no community transmission” thing right now. An average Indian comes in contact with so many people on daily basis. S/he could’ve infected others. 
    - Self isolation will be the adequate step if s/he knows that s/he has the symptoms. Before the s/he knows about the symptoms, it would be treated just as a normal “cough and cold”. The person will go to work carrying the infection and spread it. 

-	The MoH averted the question about doubling/tripling the number of cases. I think MoH is trying to avoid panic that would be caused. Can anyone tell me if it's advisable to travel to Bangalore from Mumbai. It isn't particularly urgent but I just want to understand the risk Is it time to stop hitting the gym? 2 more cases in Khed, maharashtra - [https://twitter.com/MumbaiLiveNews/status/1238294106087944193](https://twitter.com/MumbaiLiveNews/status/1238294106087944193) I don't understand how come there isn't a single reported case in MP. I know someone who worked at paytm delhi and also attended the gala. He was feeling unwell and went back to his hometown in MP.   [https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) 

from the article:  
If you have deaths in your region, you can use that to guess the number of true current cases. We know approximately how long it takes for that person to go from catching the virus to dying on average ([17.3 days](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/parameter_estimates/2019_novel_coronavirus)). That means the person who died on 2/29 in Washington State probably got infected around 2/12.

Then, you know the mortality rate. For this scenario, I’m using 1% (we’ll discuss later the details). That means that, around 2/12, there were already around \~100 cases in the area (of which only one ended up in death 17.3 days later).

Now, use the average doubling time for the coronavirus (time it takes to double cases, on average). It’s [6.2](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/parameter_estimates/2019_novel_coronavirus). That means that, in the 17 days it took this person to die, the cases had to multiply by \~8 (=2\^(17/6)). That means that, if you are not diagnosing all cases, one death today means 800 true cases today.

tl;dr there are more cases then being reported cause that many tests aren't being done.

Not only are you defeating the purpose of masks, but also causing inflation in price and reduced availability in hospitals. There's an audio recording being circulated in our college whatsapp groups about a month long country wide lockdown. The girl in the recording says that her father works in ministry of health or some shit and it'll get officially announced within 5 days. Any legitimacy to this ? What's March 31? Why is everything on lockdown until March 31? What happens after that? Won't virus spread again or is it like tentative date. Is cleaning mobile, parcels with dettol enough to disinfect them? Can anyone tell mehow busy are domestic terminals on Mumbai and Delhi airport these days? Are there additional protocols for domestic flights too?

The numbers are +919999672238 and +919999672239. 500 samples have been tested in March and they have tested negative for community transmission. More data is coming by tomorrow. These samples were from patients with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. Also these people are regular people from the community with no travel history.

God knows what is ground reality here in Mumbai. I am really really worried for my elder brother. He works in Infosys and within an ODC (Offshore Development Center) - these don't have a WFH option at all because of client agreement.

And Infosys is just shirking away from their responsibility at this point - people who do not work from ODCs have been given WFH for sure, but Infosys is not even considering for WFH at all for the many many employees who work from their ODCs. https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/coronavirus-pakistan-reports-41-new-cases-taking-tally-to-94-1.70417811

I persoanlly feel no, it isn't, but i need some public support to convince my family. How many are we testing each day? Why is govt. hiding the testing numbers? Why isn't media reporting this? My take is situation is already bad - very bad, but if it is reported, economy will take a hit and govt. doesn't want that. Although, it is inevitable. How come India such a fewer case of the virus reported? I was reading this article [Top 5 Questions on Coronavirus. Are Indians immune to COVID-19?](https://www.iturnimaginationtoreality.com/top-5-questions-on-coronavirus/) and in that, it is mentioned that India only has 39 cases reported. 

Whereas so far there 107,490 cases have been reported so far in the world. 3652 deaths have already happened because of this virus.

I hope that India is not sleeping over this. 5 cases in Pune. Confirmed on times. 

Today most recently 1 confirmed on whatsapp (until a newspaper confirms the source) A doctor from the worst affected area in Italy shares her story. Now remember, this is Italy's richest region.

>Why? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity – more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down, the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100, or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left?

>On Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room, like what is done in war. This will only get worse

>And finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people, starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients – 40, 45, 18, are coming in for treatment.

If you are, how is it going? I read in Mumbai Mirror that the cases in Mumbai are from Andheri West and that they were traveling in the same place as the Pune couple that was infected.

[Source](https://mobile.twitter.com/Vijayabaskarofl/status/1240250048639668224) A lot of people here think that India has in fact been in stage 3 for some time.

Is there any data from hospitals showing e.g unexplained number of flu cases or anything that could possibly validate that at all?

(Note: I am purely asking about actual data. Even I agree we haven't tested enough. That's why I'm talking about any ""circumstantial"" evidence.) From the patients who have recovered what has been the average period for recovery? Guys, there haven't been any new confirmed cases in India since those 3 in Kerala, which was ... about 2 weeks ago? I'm kinda suspicious. What's going on? I don't think it's likely that it would infect people and then lie dormant for weeks. This is serious. I've never gotten an off on any of the festivals including national holidays. But this time, I've been getting WFH for the last 2 days and will continue for a week. Even people who came to office today, cafeteria was closed since it involves risks. 

When my employer gives WFH, shits serious. Declare national emergency now [deleted] If everything they told were true in the press conference, it actually feel, though late, but India is doing good. I just hope that they revise the testing criteria and test anyone with symptoms. They still denying community transmission if going to bite us hard in the future.

EDIT : For what it is worth, the press conference today was actually very uplifting, if all the data was correct. Let's give it to guys working tirelessly from the onset of the cases. Also, *end mei toh sab mei hospital hi aate hain, tab kisiko nahi aata yaad kuch.* Considering the speed at which the numbers are increasing in India, it is difficult to believe that the virus took a leave of one month in February and is now back to acting like expected in March. This country needs a National Lockdown ASAP, otherwise it'd be too late. A few ago I posted here that I have developed mild symptoms and it got a bit severe today. I called the doctor for test, he denied saying I hadn't been to any affected countries, so I am not in the priority. This is so fucking unfair, like there are 3000 something cases in Germany and you still reason it out with that shitty criteria. Sucks.

A very interesting article on how Kerala is tackling the issue. Makes me wonder whether our other states are capable enough, if it spreads. A Paytm employee who just returned from Italy in Gurgaon has been tested positive for Covid-19.

TimesNow is reporting it right now. The Hyderabad case turned out to be negative. Can someone update it? A serious reflections from a Italy Endemologist, Dr.Silvia Stringhini: 

From Dr.Silvia Stringhini, Italy:

1/ I may be repeating myself, but I want to fight this sense of security that I see outside of the epicenters, as if nothing was going to happen ""here"". The media in Europe are reassuring, politicians are reassuring, while there's little to be reassured of. #COVID19 #coronavirus

2/ This is the English translation of a post of another ICU physician in Bergamo, Dr. Daniele Macchini. Read until the end ""After much thought about whether and what to write about what is happening to us, I felt that silence was not responsible.

3/ I will therefore try to convey to people far from our reality what we are living in Bergamo in these days of Covid-19 pandemic. I understand the need not to create panic, but when the message of the dangerousness of what is happening does not reach people I shudder.

4/ I myself watched with some amazement the reorganization of the entire hospital in the past week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activitieswere interrupted, intensive care were freed up to create as many beds as possible.

5/ All this rapid transformation brought an atmosphere of silence and surreal emptiness to the corridors of the hospital that we did not yet understand, waiting for a war that was yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would ever come with such ferocity.

6/ I still remember my night call a week ago when I was waiting for the results of a swab. When I think about it, my anxiety over one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I've seen what's happening. Well, the situation now is dramatic to say the least.

7/ The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. But now that need for beds has arrived in all its drama. One after the other the departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace.

8/ The boards with the names of the patients, of different colours depending on the operating unit, are now all red and instead of surgery you see the diagnosis, which is always the damned same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia.

9/ Now, explain to me which flu virus causes such a rapid drama. [post continues comparing covid19 to flu, link below]. And while there are still people who boast of not being afraid by ignoring directions, protesting because their normal routine is""temporarily"" put in crisis,

10/ the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.

11/ Cases are multiplying, we arrive at a rate of 15-20 admissions per day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the E.R. is collapsing.

12/ Reasons for the access always the same: fever and breathing difficulties, fever and cough, respiratory failure. Radiology reports always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All to be hospitalized.

13/ Someone already to be intubated and go to intensive care. For others it's too late... Every ventilator becomes like gold: those in operating theatres that have now suspended their non-urgent activity become intensive care places that did not exist before.

14/ The staff is exhausted. I saw the tiredness on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already exhausting workloads they had. I saw a solidarity of all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask ""what can I do for you now?""

15/ Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we can't save everyone, and the vital parameters of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny.

16/ There are no more shifts, no more hours. Social life is suspended for us. We no longer see our families for fear of infecting them. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols.

17/ Some of our colleagues who are infected also have infected relatives and some of their relatives are already struggling between life and death. So be patient, you can't go to the theatre, museums or the gym. Try to have pity on the myriad of old people you could exterminate.

18/ We just try to make ourselves useful. You should do the same: we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share this message. We must spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy.""

20/ I finish by saying that I really don't understand this war on panic. The only reason I see is mask shortages, but there's no mask on sale anymore. We don't have a lot of studies, but is it panic really worse than neglect and carelessness during an epidemic of this sort?

I am afraid things can get worse in India given how densely populated Indians are, and how social distancing is an alien concept for most of the Indians. Informative interviews I found on bloombergquint.com. 

Biocon MD, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw.

- Laud government efforts. They are rapidly responding to coronavirus threat. 

- Capacity building in diagnostic centres, isolation wards, ICU beds, ventilators must be the focus. Private sector needs to be roped in a much larger way. 

- We have limited diagnostic kits because of high demand across the world. 

- Rapid screening tests (within 2 hours) can be used for quick testing as opposed to current testing which gives results in 24-48 hours. US CDC has shared gene sequence of the virus. Based on that, it is very easy to setup quick diagnostic tests using PCR method. 

- The Rapid Screening tests give out false negatives when viral load is low. So, their use is limited for mass screening only. Confirmatory tests have to be more sophisticated. 

- The testing methodology can be scaled up rapidly (if the government allows) because there are many biotech firms across the country with these capabilities. 

- Number of Indian companies producing the anti-viral drugs required for treating this virus. Current inventory levels should last for 6 months at least based on estimates.

- We need to be in a state of preparedness in every aspect. 
 

MD Metropolis Healthcare, Ameera Shah

- Large scale testing has helped S.Korea to keep mortality low. India should follow same model and not do delayed testing. 

- Government should work on participating with private sector as soon as possible.

- Government tried to get its own kits made in the US. But they will take time to get approved.

- There are 7 companies who can supply the globally approved testing kits in India right now. There is increasing demand globally for these, so we have to order them sooner rather than later.

- Preliminary identification of logistical aspects of diagnostics have been identified in private sector. But there is no action on finalising those aspects yet. 

- Infrastructure is ready with us for scaling diagnostics.

- Number of queries coming in from worried patients is alarming. 

- The confirmatory test is called PCR test. This technology is considered gold standard in virology. 


Apollo hospitals MD, Sangeeta Reddy

- This is something on a massive scale that the world has not seen before. 

- Communication about the disease and social distancing needs to be very strong to the mass public. 

- Ability to collect samples from home will minimize the movement of individual. 

- Government has done fantastic job so far on communicating with private sector.

- Across private sector, beds are being identified for isolation and treatment. Health care services sector is ready if situation escalates. Though they have not been authorized to treat yet. 

- The growth curve has to be flattened as soon as possible. 
- Expecting announcement about sample collection of suspected patients from home in a day or two. 

-The likelihood of many more infected people out there is very high. Anyone who had fever, cold cough must isolate. These are very critical measures and we still have some time to flatten the curve. 

- Government has offered to pay for treatment. Insurance companies have been directed to pay via Mediclaim too. Government must be working out these policies behind the scenes. 

- We had conversations about stopping routine care in smaller units, so they can be converted to 100% dedicated units. We will also buffer understaffed government facilities. 

- Sanitizer and masks are truly in shortage. They are to be judiciously used. 

- Masks to be disposed off carefully by anyone using them with symptoms. 

- If you're travelling on a bus, disinfecting your own area will help a lot as the virus stays on stainless steel for long periods.

Note: Data concerning India is not considered in the analysis but it is still helpful in explaining the gravity of the situation. Can anyone confirm if any measures are taken by the UP govt? There was supposed to be a meeting today. I don't see anything wrt schools/colleges/workplaces.

Edit: Schools and colleges will be closed till 22nd March in UP, also  448 new isolation wards created. I don't think that's enough though, lets see.

Can they fire ppl to counter that in case of a lockdown ?  
I still don't hear any office being closed in India ? I am bit worried about myself now.i have feeling like fever but mild fever i dont have any problem with fever but cough i have cough now.

Everywhere people are suggesting to practice self isolation and social distancing, while IIT Palakkad is still running. The Institute is a new IIT and is working from two campuses, one in the site of their permanent campus, and the other in the campus of Ahalia group, which includes multiple hospitals as well. The institute has formally suspended classes, but has left the decision of leaving hostels to the students. In such times of global pandemic, the IIT Palakkad administration is pushing the responsibility of student safety onto the students. They have claimed that the hostels are safe, even when faculty and staff are coming from outside the campus (all faculty and staff are living outside, since the institute is new). Also, the people going to ahalia hospitals are also moving past the IIT hostels. It is rumoured that the director has said that the virus wont affect young people, so no need to be worried of any student getting infected {Rumours, no proof}. The research scholars have also been officially told that they can leave if they want, but most of the supervisors have said that they should be here as this time is perfect for research without any distractions. When the Kerala government is doing so much to defeat this contagion, IIT palakkad might end up as a black mark on the record. [The official notification sent by the institute](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xeS76yrfT6uaBPleZvDT5_bqR5qBv6FN/view) says that the students can decide what to do.

These fucks don’t care about the country! It’s always only about themselves and their personal interests > **India yet to share genome sequence data**

> China isolated the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from a patient and shared the first whole genome sequence data of the virus with the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) on January 11. This allowed scientists from across the world to study the genome data to know more about the virus origin and develop diagnostics.

> As on March 4, 23 countries, including Nepal, Vietnam and Cambodia, have shared 159 genome sequence data. At 65, China has deposited the most number of genome sequences followed by the U.S. (16), Australia (10), Japan (9) and Singapore and South Korea (eight sequences each).

> However, till date, India has not shared even one genome sequence data.

> Even in 2015 H1N1 outbreak when 42,592 cases and 2,990 deaths were reported from India, the full genome sequence data was not shared with the WHO reference laboratories or deposited in public databases.

Wtf??? Are they lazy? incompetent? selfish? stupid? Or all of these? Statistically speaking, for a population of 1.3B we are handling the crisis exceptionally well, rather too well for comfort. Merely 30 cases is way too low. I feel that something is amiss. Delhi government has called for shutdown of all schools and colleges of Delhi but the main confusion is whether this rule applies to students of Delhi University, JNU, Jamia, etc too since they're under the central government. Can anyone please confirm regarding this matter? 


(To be honest, if it's not applied to these other students, it's completely illogical and insensitive as they're also residing in Delhi. Can't see the logic in not including them)

Edit: Delhi government is to be applauded for these preventive measures, the subject in question is the Central Government. My family thinks the virus is more likely to damage non veg people than veg people

Just heard the 11th March episode of Joe Rogan Experience podcast featuring Michael Osterholm, internationally recognised expert in infectious diseases and epidemiology. I’ll provide the links here:

It’s very very informative and I would like to briefly highlight some key points that Michael told:

-	**Surgical masks are of a little help**. **N95 masks are effective** but there is no need to worry if you practice isolation. 
-	It is **not** an old person’s disease. Yes, the fatalities are high in that age range, but people between the age **40-60**  have to be equally cautious. Avoid public contact is the best way to prevent the spread. 
       -	**People having underlying** health problems should **AVOID public contact**. 
       -	Michael also mentions that surprisingly, people below the age of 19 are have developed no symptoms even if they were exposed to the virus. Additionally he gave statistics about China, where only 2.1% cases of the people under 19 were affected. They get infected but do not get sick. 

-	The act of breathing can get you infected. 
-	Hand sanitizer do help. They are a must. 
-	Incubation period is 4 days. 
-	The virus shows asymptotic transmission. 
-	Heat won’t really help. 
-	Do not expect vaccines anytime soon. At least, 1.5 to 2 years is needed.

I have a bad feeling that this is not going to age well. The real joke is I see this thread being downvoted every few refreshes Here's a message from Bill Gates from 2015:

[The next outbreak? We are not ready](https://youtu.be/6Af6b_wyiwI) What i believe is that community transmission has already begun in our country. The virus itself takes 7 to 14 days to show any symptoms in its host. So all those people who passed the checkup at airports ( checked with an IR thermometer as far as i know) might already have been carriers of the disease. Also the fact we are testing at a far slower rate is the reason why so few cases have been reported. 
I think the government already sensed that community transmission has begun in the country so they are reporting as little cases as possible so there is no panic and our hospitals dont get saturated with people ( which  in Wuhan lead to unnecessary deaths). The mortality rate of this virus is not that high , so young people who get infected will do fine by with normal Medicare and treatment. How smart this move was, only time will tell. It is already flu season so educated people who are a bit under weather are self quarantining themselves at their homes.
The immediate cause of concern is the holi festival, which sees massive gatherings in the hindu belt, and can be a hunting ground for this virus. 
The next 2 weeks are going to be the turning point, those who were infected and didn't show any symptoms will start getting sick and fear will set in, and the mob mentality in our country might wreak havoc on the healthcare system if shit gets out of hand. The only thing that can save our country right now is as little panic and paranoia as possible , and a focus on healthy practices like washing hands and maintaining safe distance from people who look visibly sick. I hope the whole country is put on lockdown for atleast 20 days. But thats unlikely Arre yarr meri gaand fatt rahi hei!!!!!!! Active cases 69 now ^nice I am soooo pissed off at how the Indian Government is handling this pandemic right now. I cam back from Kolkata on March 8th. Since then I am having dry cough and diarrhea.

Some Key Points:

1. In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the **most ambitious, agile and aggressive** disease containment effort in history.
2. Achieving China’s exceptional coverage with and adherence to these containment measures has only been possible due to the **deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action** in the face of this common threat.
3. China’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic ...  **decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real**.
4. **Much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China**.
5. For countries other than China: **Immediately activate** the **highest level** of national Response Management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approach needed to contain COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures;
6. For the international community: Recognize that true solidarity and collaboration is essential between nations to tackle the common threat that COVID-19 represents and operationalize this principle; Travelling to Bangalore this weekend by flight.

Some guidance from IOIBD regarding COVID-19:

*What are the current recommendations for IBD patients related to COVID19?*

Many patients have already asked us if they should stop their medications. Medicines such as mesalamine (brand names include Asacol, Apriso, Balsalazide, Lialda, Pentasa) are all safe. It is always a good idea to get off of steroids such as prednisone/prednisilone, if this is possible. Thiopurines (6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine) and tofacitinib tend to inhibit the body’s immune response to viral infections. The thiopurines take months to leave the body. Thus stopping these will not help in the short term. The biologics we currently use to treat IBD such as anti-TNFs (Cimzia, Humira, Remicade, Simponi), ustekinumab (Stelara), vedolizumab (Entyvio) are generally safe. At present we do not recommend stopping these medications. Moreover, the effect of these medications stay in the body, in many cases, for months. We will keep updating these recommendations as more data become available.

So the Dubai tour group from which people keep testing positive, how come those cases are still being found? One by one? How long has it been since then? 14 days plus I believe. The incubation period seems extremely variable. If anyone has any insight into this please share. when do symptoms usually appear? And what about asymptomatic cases, how will anyone dream if they have covid? Assuming I have not come in contact with anyone directly, but travelled six days back by a domestic flight, with all precautions and did not touch my face even once, what are the chances I may have it? Both the destinations don't have a single case till now. I'm extremely worried, as I show no symptoms but due my anxiety keep imagining them. This is tough time for anyone with anxiety issues and all the negativity in this thread doesn't help. I'm not saying it's bad to worry and panic at this time, but since there is no clarity on community spread, can't say anything.

How true is it that it may be widespread here? No one is reporting unusual pneumonia cases, so that's some hope right? I have a feeling we have contained it better than other countries, but all the scepticism about it is getting me extremely worried. Any positive news would help.

>high temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19, respectively, even after controlling for population density and GDP per capita of cities. One degree Celsius increase in temperature and one percent increase in relative humidity lower R by 0.0383 and 0.0224, respectively. This result is consistent with the fact that the high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of influenza. It indicates that the arrival of summer and rainy season in the northern hemisphere can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID-19.


So, good news. A male, with recent travel history to India confirmed with coronavirus in Santa Clara County,US. What we see in India is just the tip of an iceberg I feel. The ministry says that they have the capacity to run 2500 tests a day now, yet there have been only some 6000 odd tests done in over a MONTH! Doesn't make sense, what are we waiting for? it's been known that virus can spread from asymptomatic people as well. Also, does anyone believe that there hasn't been a single case of community transmission? With our popular and hygiene practices it's basically impossible. [deleted] Everybody stay safe out there

As an indian, I'm 100% certain that the amount of heart wrenching shit that will take place amidst the impending outbreak will be much more horrible I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist but India's actual numbers must be in 1000's. Our testing criteria only tests for people who have foreign travel history and their direct contacts. Not taking into account the primary source of spread(community transmission). Add India's population density, hygiene standards and lack of medical infrastructure (52 centers for 1.1 billion people, assuming only 10% of people get it and only 10% of them require medical assistance/tests, it means each center will need to serve 2 lakh people). Plus a good number of Indians are either smokers, suffer from diabetes or are extremely unfit/obese. 
Today the government denied that India has seen no community transmission, how is this possible? In a country so jam packed where people spit/cough anywhere, not a single case of transmission from a person who has not traveled outside to another person? 
I don't want to create panic but must people have been lulled into a false sense of security, for something like corona virus India is the worst case country(including few other south east Asian countries and few African countries). 
In a few weeks, India is going to be a shit hole, if a country like Italy(better infrastructure, hygiene, less population density) is seeing 200 deaths per day(and the virus has not peaked), imagine the number of deaths in India when it peaks. And no the summer won't save you, it may/may not slightly decrease the intensity at which it spreads, but nothing more. 

> one chance at life.

> born in India. This fucking country has to go on LOCKDOWN. But the political class with the corporate industry is trying to crawl over it without any decisiveness.

Common folks are panicking without knowing the full extent and adversity which will be caused by this pandemic - which is, in reality much more than what they think now. Let's not celebrate Holi this year with water and colours as it may act as a medium by which the Coronavirus can spread among people. India just has 2 COVID-19 cases as of now. Let  us not play Holi this year, and let's be cautious. Unless home isolation for anyone with mild respiratory symptoms is implemented in a couple of days, the hospitals are going to be swamped. 
30-40 year old patients with completely white out lungs are being admitted. 
This wiil be my last post. It shall be deleted soon. 

1. Hospitals are the amplifying points at this point. 
Watch this [this](https://youtu.be/C-wf_cC0Kek) to know how. 
We don't have a system for surveillance of infections in healthcare staff in India. 

2. Government backed home isolation is the only option at this point. 

3. Take care of yourself. Do not protect yourself just from covid-19 but all forms of injuries and diseases. Hospitals won't be able to take new cases in 2-3 weeks. 

4. Government has not taken proactive steps to prepare hospitals. 
  i. Elective surgeries should have been reduced by now.
  ii. OPDs gradually curtailed.
  iii. A separate section or building for receiving patients with respiratory symptoms. 

5. Expect high rise buildings to become disease hotspots. 

6. Even with best measures, there would be more than 100,000 casualties over next 3-4 months due to covid-19. And over 300,000 due to strain put on the health system by covid-19. 

7. There are high chances of simultaneous outbreaks of other diseases like cholera, typhoid, malaria, dengue, swine flu. 

8. It will be a tough year

9. Expect resurgence in cases by the end of the year. Also expect to find the real long term consequences only by the end of next year.

10. Beware of Gilead. 


All the best everyone. 
Hope you and your loved ones make through this year. 
I probably won't. It's Holi time. People would be visiting tier 2 cities from metros, especially cities in Bihar, UP, Jharkhand. If the virus spreads there, that would truly be a disaster. How India is hopelessly unprepared to fully understand or tackle the Coronavirus (COVID-19) threat..

COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease, which can spread through aeroisis, which means that it can remain suspended in the air. It can also be spread through fecal matter, urine, and other bodily fluids. In fact, it is so highly infectious, that there were reports of an entire apartment building getting infected because of a single infected through shared ventilation. The events of the Diamond Princess lend credence to this. Presently, India's measures to deal with COVID-19 have been below par. Though India has surveilled and tracked down people who returned from Wuhan to India, it has not expanded its testing beyond that, especially now, when countries are beginning to see local H2H spread. 


COVID-19 is also particularly dangerous because of its long asymptomatic period, which can last from anywhere between 7 to 24 days, some have even been asymptomatic for 30 days. During the asymptomatic stage, the virus can be transmitted to other people.


In fact, scientists have stated that the asymptomatic stage is actually more infectious than the symptomatic stage. It is possible that this virus is spreading throughout India and we are not directly seeing it's effects because either most of the people who have it are currently asymptomatic OR people are dismissing the initial symptoms such as cough and fever as normal flu symptoms. The symptoms are also accompanied with respiratory distress, which then later result into pneumonia.


The problem with COVID-19 is not really its fatality rate, which is currently speculated to be 2%, the real problem is that almost 20% of the cases develop severe pneumonia which requires ICU treatment and ventilation. It does not take great imagination to foresee a scenario where thousands of people with this virus would require hospitalization, which would completely overwhelm the health services of our country. Such a scenario could result in a Wuhan like situation. 


Currently, South Korea and Italy are engaged in zealous testing for the virus, and the more they test, the more cases they seem to find. I think India is no where close to be doing the amount of testing required which can grasp the true scale of COVID-19 in India.

Therefore, it is my request to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to make an audacious attempt to try and test all the non-bacterial pneumonia cases which have developed in India over the past 2 weeks for the COVID-19. I believe that doing so will illuminate the real extent of COVID-19 in India. Amazon won’t dock warehouse workers for missing shifts during coronavirus crisis Chinese electronics company Xiaomi donates tens of thousands of masks to Italy, and quotes Seneca: ""We are waves of the same sea, leaves of the same tree, flowers of the same garden"".

https://twitter.com/arjunsethi81/status/1237928847582081024?s=19 Thank god BCCI made a sensible decision by postponing IPL till April 15. Quarantine : learnt a short story on this word. Back in the day, when plague was rampant in italy, there used to be an island, poveglia, where those affected were left to die. Sometimes, they would be burnt alive. There used to be an island at the front of poveglia, where there used to be diagnosis of the patients, and they would be kept here for 40 days, before they would either improve, and seek their way back to mainland italy, or be sent to die, in poveglia. The word quarantine originated from the word ""40"" in italy. 
Poveglia still stands today, as one of the weirdest places across earth, with its history taking an even bigger turn for the worse with a mental asylum, where the doctor conducted lobotomies on live subjects, and died falling off a building.

Damn. Two concerns:
Why are Indians refusing to get tested or be in quarantine? I have seen few stories till now where officials had to force people to get tested.
And why is our go to response for such a thing involves not eating meat?
I suppose there is a strong sense of deep lying guilt in Indians about our indulgence with meat. This [article](https://www.cnbctv18.com/healthcare/what-icmr-said-on-coronavirus-today-on-masks-testing-capacity-and-more-5481541.htm) says that we have the capacity to test 60-70 samples per day per lab. We have 52 labs. So, that should mean 3120-3640 tests per day.

This [press release from ICMR](https://www.icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/whats_new/PressRelease_10Mar2020_10AM_IST.pdf) says that we tested 5372 samples (3828 suspects + 1544 evacuees) in all by 10th March.

The article above also says that we have tested 6500 samples in all by 13th March morning, so let's say end of 12th March.

These numbers aren't adding up. If we are capable of testing 3000 something in a day, why did the numbers increment by only 600 per day between 10th and 12th? Also, I can't find any source reporting testing numbers after 13th.

Can we report the number of samples tested at the end of every day in the google doc? Something like:

* 10 Mar - 5372
* 11 Mar - No data
* 12 Mar - 6500
* 13 Mar - No data
* 14 Mar - No data Open Source Ventilator Project: https://medium.com/@brucefenton/we-need-ventilators-we-need-you-to-help-build-them-30805e5ee2ea

1) My Son who is in India (US citizen) on visa, what happens to his validity. 
2) I am suppose to travel to India to join them (Indian Citizen) next week, what is the meaning of ""May be Quarantine"", is it self one at home or in the hospital ? When would these travel restrictions be lifted, is there any historic data of something like this happening and then the final restrictions being lifted.

I was supposed to travel to Delhi on Friday (USA via France) and I've just canceled my flight, feels so bad. Guys I'm travelling to Hong Kong this weekend for couple of weeks, will I be quarantined on arrival? Father in law had a layover in Germany on March 3rd then arrived in Delhi. He's a US citizen. His flight back is next Tuesday. I read about a quarantine if people have visited Germany after Feb 15th. Is a layover (2h) considered a visit in this procedure?
Will he be quarantined?

I am in the middle of a job search before this began. I don't have a job as of now (sorta fresher).

It was difficult to get calls before all this began. I was wondering if I should be focusing on improving my resume during this time or dedicate as much time as before in applications.

In a way how is the hiring scene in the corporate world? History of Pandemics:

https://i.redd.it/bfhqm2t6mcn41.jpg This might seem selfish but I don't care a lot about this virus infecting me (I am younger so lesser rate of mortality, and as I am in a rather isolated college campus so lesser chance of infection, probably a stupid reason) but I am actually scared for my parents.

> * 12 new countries have reported their first cases & there are now 21 countries with one case only. ""The actions these newly-affected countries take today will be the difference between a handful of cases and a larger cluster""

> * **""This #coronavirus is not SARS, it’s not MERS & it’s not influenza. It is a unique virus with unique characteristics.** Both #COVID19 & influenza cause respiratory disease & spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose & mouth of someone who is sick""- @DrTedros

> * **""However, there are some important differences. First, #COVID19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza. With influenza, people who are infected but not yet sick are major drivers of transmission, which does not appear to be the case for COVID-19""**

> * The second major difference is that #COVID19 causes more severe disease than seasonal influenza. While many people globally have built up immunity to seasonal flu strains, COVID-19 is a new #coronavirus to which no one has immunity""




> * **""Globally, about 3.4% of reported #COVID19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected""**

> * ""Third, we have vaccines & therapeutics for seasonal flu, but at the moment there is no vaccine & no specific treatment for #COVID19. **However, clinical trials of therapeutics are now being done & more than 20 vaccines are in development""**

> * ""These differences mean we can’t treat #COVID19 exactly the same way we treat flu. But there are enough similarities to mean that countries are not starting from scratch. For decades, many countries have invested in building up their systems to detect & respond to flu""

They go on to talk about how panic buying and hoarding of masks and medical equipment is creating problems for front line health workers and putting them at risk. Encourages the governments to come forward and help meet the shortfall by giving incentives to the industry. Some good news.

* Haryana

* Chhattisgarh I don't believe we're at less than 100 cases. I think the only reason for that number is that the labs are selectively testing people. Community spread must be on by now. What's the source behind the news of no. of cases in MH increasing to 31? Last I checked it was 14. please state source. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that is not happening. Earlier this month, CDC scientists reported that the rate of symptomatic infection among a patient’s household members was 10.5%. The rate among other close contacts was 0.45%

That suggests that aerosolized virus particles are, at worst, rare in real-world conditions.

*\*facepalm\** Hey guys, totally self interested question, sorry about that.

 Im a 23 year old guy from the Netherlands backpacking through India at the moment and was originally planning to stay here till the end of may. I am now in Secunderabad near Hyderabad and plan the following weeks to mainly stay in northern mountainous state of Himachal Pradesh, something which Im very stoked about. Do you guys have any idea wether it would be wise to head back soon? 

Some things that worry me:

-  It maybe being wise to fly back while I still can, perhaps I wont be able to in late may or before that If I wanted to if the country becomes too apocalyptic to make it worthwhile. An apocalyptic Netherlands seems better than an apocalyptic India. 

-  If shit really starts hitting the fan here, there might be violence against white people, probably because of slumdog millionaire and the recent delhi riots I have this stereotype in my head of India being a country quite prone to this type of xenophobic behavior

-  If I am one of those outlier young people who get a serious case of corona my odds of surviving might be significantly higher in the netherlands (btw, does anyone have an idea what the likely fatality rate of this virus is for healthy men around 23?)

-  Travelling through India the coming    months being very selfish, inconsiderate behavior, because I might infect a bunch of more fragile people

Sorry if this sounds irrational and alarmist, feeling fairly reactive right now after a terrible night on a night train. Perhaps you guys can supply me with some nonreactive wisdom.

https://scroll.in/latest/956567/covid-19-kolkata-man-falls-ill-after-drinking-cow-urine-bjp-leader-who-organised-event-arrested?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=public I don't think people are taking this pandemic seriously. If it actually spreads through the masses which is very easy in our country, we are looking at 20-30 million deaths in India? There are lot of idiots running around saying ""it's just the flu bro, why are you in panic?"" in US, same attitude I have seen in many Indians saying kuch nahi hoga. These are the ones who go around transmitting virus to everyone and there would be an explosive growth in hospital admissions leading to shortage of beds. Not only this selfish assholes ruin medical care for people in genuine need, also, people who need medical care or ICU for reasons other than corona virus will not be able to get the much needed care. China has 4.3 beds per 10,000 whereas India has only .7.  Still, China literally sacrificed an entire province to curb the growth and still not yet contained completely. In India, we are fucked . Ideally, the government should've put all the possible resources to screen the international passengers and should've increased the testing centres significantly, not 57 for a country of billion people. USA CDC is distributing 1.1 million test kits this weekend, I honestly don't know what is our capacity. Put an additional tax for covid19 screening for international passengers, get the swab samples even if they are not symptomatic before letting them in the country. This would be possible only if we had scaled up like South Korea, guess that's not going to happen in million years. Because, for India, community transmission is not containable at all. A daily wage laborer will not sit at home for flu symptoms quarantining himself for 14 days. If he does, he will die of hunger rather than the virus. The government dropped the ball big time here.

u/IAmMohit BIG QUESTION :

So my college announced 1 month holiday. I will have to go home to Hyderabad from Bangalore. I do not have any kind of symptoms.

So, question being, in terms of Corona safety, which should be my preferred mode of public transport?

Bus, Flight or Train?

Good news. Till yesterday evening, 11500 samples were tested. I suggest adding info from articles like this into a google spreadsheet(ideally it should all be in one google map for the entire country). There have been two or three articles of this nature each with its own flowchart. Indian media is so inept. They have a stupid looking flowchart and they don't collect all the data from multiple cases in one place.

Wear it whether sick or not. Government should invest in mass producing masks and give it free to citizens. It will work out be lot cheaper than managing an outbreak. 

Don't get me wrong - masks in this situation are not to prevent entry of virus into uninfected persons but to prevent exit of virus from infected persons into the environment. 
This will cut the problem at it's source. Instead masks are being banned for public consumption! So far all the cases in India which are tested positive either have travel history or contraction due to person having travel history.

Hell will break loose if we identify positive case without source of contraction. [deleted] My friend made a live counter for all of us to keep a track of COVID-19 cases. Hopefully, someone will benefit from this. Stay safe, and stay indoor.

https://twitter.com/karanbirtinna/status/1239014869002670080?s=19

slight possibility he could be lying, he was with 2 infected people and ate with them India for me can be the next big centre of this virus. The cases can shoot up really high and we can really be in a helpless state given the population, density of population, the general hygiene of a majority of the population due to living conditions etc. 

Our government for a normal country is doing a decent job, especially states like Kerala is doing extensive checking and awareness programs and we have also gone I to semi shut down of big cities but really going the next step and shutting down a city like Mumbai looks next to impossible so it's a real challenge until people really corporate. sadly with all the awarness programs we might not be able to reach 30-40% of the population , which is ~300-400 mn, the population of United States. 

The one thing I really hope can save India is possibly our natural immunity to viruses. We are born and brought up in really difficult conditions in terms of air and water quality and the exposure lot of viruses and bacteria. This in someway I believe can improve our immunity. No scientific proof but I have seen Indians including myself go to United States live for years without ever falling sick even once while not even taking a flu shot whereas my colleagues there fall sick annually even under such conditions so this is one thing I have hope on to save us. I know it might sound stupid but sadly my biggest hope is stupidity now because not sure we can reach everyone in India to understand the criticality of the virus.

For those who understand please follow the rules of cleaning your hands, safe distancing etc etc. 

Let's fight this and hope for the best. [removed] The country where I'm in put out a mandatory leave for all schools for the next 4 weeks, yet Cbse us holding board exams.

India is conducting only about 90 tests per day. There is absolutely no doubt here that the number of infected people is much larger than advertised. Do not believe the number advertised, practice social distancing at all costs, get enough supplies so you only have to go out every week or 2weeks to buy food/supplies.

H1N1 cases have started showing up, once hospitals hit their limit people with mild preventable cases wont get admission which will start leading to preventable deaths. The problem here isn't just Corona, but how it's impacting everything else along with it. Quite unreasonable but Can we suspend all International Flights ?

Welp if it starts to spread (which most probably it has), India is pretty much screwed.... However the climatic conditions in India do not favour the survivability of virus (at least that's what I have read and from my cousin whose a doctor). But it's better to start quarantine at the earliest before it goes Jack shit crazy. Anywho... stay safe at affected areas and follow standard procedures to combat it.... Also as media paints it, it's not that deadly. I mean if u get it u woundn't die instantaneously (if detected before it transformes into pneumonia).... Life is not going to be the same anymore. Every flu like symptoms will be seen with suspicion. Going out in public with flu like symptoms will probably start drawing people's ire and induce panic. Hospitals will be overwhelmed with patients with Flu symptoms even if it is not Covid-19. This would mean hospital beds for other forms of diseases will take a hit and people with other diseases will also suffer. Not looking good at all. A big FU to the mask hoarders. Masks are actually required by people who have symptoms so that they don’t spread it to others. Wearing a mask won’t save you from an infection if you don’t practice proper hygiene or keep touching your face with your hands. This is the conduct of an indian ambassador in Iran

Yes, we must be vigilant and follow the basic hygiene guidelines as specified by WHO. But banning and cancelling everything is not the solution.

The elderly definitely need to be extra vigilant, especially those who have travelled abroad recently but spread of panic by saying that ""We are fucked"" is not going to help.We can't afford to shut down everything especially when our economy is already weak.

Hello all,

I see one of friend has returned from UK to India and his apartment dwellers have asked him to stop using his own maid, cook and helper services ,inspite of his through check in the airports and not showing any symptoms.

Too many docs in India prescribe antibiotics and thereby weakening the immune system in, especially urban areas. This disease primary victims are mostly from urban areas. That is one more reason to be concerned. This sub is ridiculously overreacting and trying to fault anything and everything state and Central govts do regarding this.We has  Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala couple of years ago which is far deadlier than Coronavirus and the Govt took impeccable measures to control the outbreak with the region and minimise deaths. Same with the likes of Swine Flu etc .

I am sure the Govt(s) and Health departments know what they are doing . They also actually have real-time experience in outbreaks like these unlike western nations. 

Afterall we face up disasters like cyclones and floods and Epidemics almost every year in India. So this isn’t going to be any different because there is a world wide epidemic. So frankly as an Indian if comes to the  worst we just have to go through it like all the disasters we always do.

And finally Just because Europe has shut down doesn’t mean India can or will shut down. India is a country with more than 400mil who live behind poverty line. How is it dying through sartvation for these people (by staying at home) better than suffering coronavirus. 

Edit :


Honestly people if that are worried should stay at home instead advising  everyone else to stay at home. You can’t expect rest of India to be locked up in quarantine or wear masks in Public.

It's unfortunate, but I guess that's how it is for a lot of situations in India when dealing with the police. [deleted] Call 100 immediately and tell them you are being pressured by  [Ofiicer name] to hand over phone for illegal search. It's high time people start using dash cams. Imagine all the shit that would be uncovered. No. Tell your friend to stop watching loli hentai. Something similar happened to me twice in Bangalore. The first incident, I was walking along with my friends returning from a restaurant in Koramangala. It was almost midnight. We were split up into a group of two. Two policemen on a bike stopped right in front of the first group asked my friend a few questions like: 

* Where are you coming from?
* Where do you stay?
* Which city are you from?
* Where do you work? 

After inquiring about this he was still not satisfied and asked him to come closer. He then went on to search his pockets, thinking he might find some drugs or something. He then told us that to go straight to your home and walking like that in a middle of the night is not allowed here. 

I was furious at the whole situation. I knew that they don't have the rights to do such a thing but at the same time I didn't want to make a scene. So I let that go. 

On the second incident, the same thing happened, this time in HSR. We were waiting for an Uber at midnight. And here they came again and asked: ""What are we doing here?"". Luckily, we had a white guy with us (an employee from the US) so they were hesitant to ask any further question and told us to leave the area and hurried away. 

I don't know man how to feel about this.  Not a lawyer but of course no. [removed] If you get stopped by police at night or in middle of somewhere, first ask for IDs. They can be impersonators too. Secondly being polite in conversations is the best way to not hurt their small dick egos and wade your way out through it. 

And constables do have the smallest dicks..sorry egos. I had two constables in plain clothes knocking my door at 6 in morning. They started inquiring about my bike, asking for RC card. I asked them for their IDs. They told they are night time patrol party. I still insisted on IDs. They took the photo of my bike and went away. After few mins they bought a patrolling van with two dressed policemen. The point of contention was my bike not have number plates. Then they started telling me we will impound the bike and after showing all the relevant documents like RC card, insurance, driving license etc they went. All the this time the two constables where behaving as they are the SP of the district. They can ask, but you don't have to comply. They can seize the items on your person if they're arresting you, but they need cause or a warrant to actually arrest you. Once arrested, you can't be held more than 24 hours without being taken to a magistrate. 
In my view, if you haven't done anything wrong, you should never turn over your phone to police just because they ask.

You can learn more about your basic rights at nyaaya.in I was once asked to step out of a cab and was frisked and question. Have always wondered if they were legally allowed to do it. And if no, what's the best thing to do other than being politely adamant about a fuck no. Even tried asking a lawyer once, still got no answer to this.  Yes they can search a person without warrant.(does no one here use google :p)

*not 100% sure*
They can also make you handover your phone.
But if it’s locked, you can say you forgot your PIN and deny them access to it. (at least in US, this is perfectly legal)
Although, Indian police being indian police, may give you a slap. किस्मत हो गांडू तो क्या करेगा पाण्डू ! माँ चुदी और क्या, दे दे फ़ोन. It's kinda off topic but relevant. 

I was sitting outside of our apartment along with a friend around 1-2am in the morning. We were just cracking jokes and taking jabs at each other, and mind you we were not disturbing anybody. So, a few minutes later, two cops pull up and start asking questions such as 

Where do I live? 

Who do you live with?

Which flat? 

Owner or tenant? 

After answering all their queries, they asked me to leave just turn around and go home, but they followed my friend till home.  You are not obligated to hand over anything to a police officer, there are even laws on how much each police rank can fine a person for.

However, India doesn't operate under laws. If a policeman wants to hurt you he probably can and also get away with it. The justice system is slow, often corrupt and expensive.  Look. Officers of the Peace are your friends. 

Second, they are bound to observe civil liberties, and balance the public trust.



Third, it is your duty to know your civil rights.

The dialogue b/w an Officer, and a citizen proceeds on the basis of these basic civics.

If you're not endangering public safety, they must justify why they want to confiscate your personal items.

AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Folks who have lived outside the country for a while, which is the best country to migrate to currently?",16,agi0qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/agi0qb/askindia_folks_who_have_lived_outside_the_country/,32,"I keep hearing random cons from people. For e.g.

* UK - Brexit will cause job losses

* US - Trump's supporters will kill you

* Australia - Racist

* Canada - Not enough money",hiaastha," I can something about US as I have stayed there for 3 years.

&#x200B;

1) College Towns are generally the easiest places to live in in the US. Generally multi-cultural and very easy to stay. 

2) Biggest Con- Real Estate. Depending on where you are moving, you may have to pay an insane amount for rent. 

3) I have travelled extensively in the mid-west and east coast through small towns and big cities and personally I haven't faced any severe form of racism. Stereotyping yes and overall curiousness about the country and its people but nothing severe. 

4) If you are moving anywhere outside the country the biggest advice I can give you is that learn to live like a local and pick up local customs and habits but do not lose your cultural identity in the process.  I have done my college from the States and have worked in Australia for some time, so can share my opinion about these two countries.

1) US  - Getting work authorization in the United States is more difficult now than ever before. The conditions for qualifying for the long term visa grant is now more stringent. That's all.

2) Australia - I didn't face any sort of racism in Australia, either professionally or personally ever. Majority of Australians are friendly blokes. I used to visit a lot of small towns in the outbacks for work related reasons. Such towns have relatively lower literacy rates than the bigger towns such as Brisbane , Sydney etc. But even there I never faced any racism in any form. My guess is media gives to much coverage to negative incidents (such as racism, rapes, lynchings etc.) thus building the negative perception about any country for that matter. 

 I have lived in USA for 15 and a half years now. I live in a deep red (Trump supporting) state. I do not agree with your potrayal of the situation that Trump supporters are out to kill foreigners. I haven't really faced any safety issues after Trump's victory that can be attributed to him winning the election.

Generally speaking in order to move to United States you have three options. 1) come as a student and after finishing your degree, if you can secure a good job move to a work visa and then eventually get a green card. 2) Come to United States on a work visa sponsored by your employer who everyway sponsors your Green card as well. 3) you get a green card through a sponsorship from an immediate family member who is a US citizen. Options 1 and 2 mission before are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve. Part of the problem is the Trump administration has increased the scrutiny of H1B visas manifold. The other problem is there's a tremendous amount of wait time for specifically Indians after the employers sponsor their green card application. Currently it is projected that Indians who applied for green card in 2018 under eb-2 or eb-3 category will have to wait 70-80 years to get the green card. This green card backlog was not created by Trump administration. NZ is nice.  Trump supporters won’t kill you, no such thing is happening. Check out r/askanamerican, this concern has been addressed there.  Japan is good, if you can learn the language. I am a student here. If you keep looking for cons, you will start finding them...


Uk is definitely a no-no if you aren't looking for a very specialized advancement oriented traveller. If you seek advanced knowledge, go uk. But move out for employment.

US, a perspective other than IT crowd is, its not that safe. Gun crime is high. If you own stores, keep gun and pray nobody comes to loot you with gun. Citizenship is next to impossible. 

Canada, students are poaching jobs. Life is bland. And thand... Ufff.

Australia, recently they are refusing visa to relatives left right and centre...

Germany, language is pain in ass.

Italy, too pendu. Poor returns. Also, language.

Spain, cousin to Italy. Decent money.

Belgium, so far lucrative but expensive.

France, good if into highly trained industry. Train to Britannia was gold buy now, London walo ko kaise milne jau? If you have enough money. Monaco is perfect.  Anyone has an idea How is the job scene in Australia like for software engineers ? Are there enough opportunities for them like in India ? Currently I am Living in USA for around 2 years now and honestly it depends on your state and locality. 
Don't go and follow the stereotypes 
Not every rednecks who support trump is a racist 
Not every black hood guy is a bad person 
When someone is creepy you will easily get a vibe. 

In my opinion if you have to move to USA :skip Nevada or Vegas maybe chose reno it's an amazing place 

Orange county if you have money 

Don't think about moving to ny lol 
Maryland is close to Canada 
Dallas is mini India 
Can't think more now 


So if you are scared move to Dallas a lot of Indians are already there  You're not fit for any country because the way you simply generalize the entire country in few words is naive.",2019-01-16 13:38:18

It means that the original note bearing this number was printed defectively. So, this note was printed to serve as a replacement for it.

That was anticlimactic. Yup, those are fake notes originating from Israel. The fake notes originating from Pakistan and Bangladesh have a crescent moon in its place.

Good luck comrade! You can use it as a wildcard. Star marked five hundred rupee notes presently in use will no longer be legal tender from midnight tonight, that is 13th November 2018. 

This means that these notes will not be acceptable for transactions from midnight onwards.

In many countries daily press briefings are held to inform the people about the state of preparedness against COVID19. Questions are asked by the Press.

I want to know about availability of PPE for doctors, nurses and health staff.  
I want to know how many hospitals, ventilators, ICUs are ready.  
I want to know if COVID19 testing will be made accessible and affordable.

I want to know who and how the food and medical needs of the migrant workers are being addressed.  
I want to know how farmers will cope with this distress.  
I want to know how women will escape domestic violence trapped in their homes.  
I want to know what is being done to enable trans persons and sex workers to survive this period of lockdown.

/s It's shameful when even members of my own family tell me that, ""Yes! we will light the diyas. It will be fun."" I do not understand why people cannot see through his events, PR moves and incompetence! I am with you .... I'm proud of you OP. And your questions are definitely valid at thid point and so for the citizens of the country aswell. It's just frustrating at this point. My brother is a 3rd year resident doctor and he told me that their is no proper safety/precautions for them. They are being provided fucking plastic sheet vest for treatment smh. And he is in government hosiptal. So leave the conditions in private hospitals. I talked to him after our ""beloved modiji's"" live. And he said to me that instead of doing such chutiyapa why he is not providing us test kits, protective gears. Why it has been so delayed. As if they didn't expected the virus to come in our country. Everyone did! Why isn't he doing anything about the migrant workers?? Why our home minister just vanished at this point. Lighting diyas or banging thaalis isn't going to change anything. Keeping the ""morale high"" is a different thing. Do that if you are capable of controlling the situation and all this as side things. But their isn't much progress and it's very concerning. How many test kits are only reserved for VIPs. Doctors are working like slaves right now and not much facilities are being provided to them and don't even talk about the patients. *BC, galli mein Havan karenge 9th ko* - Bhakts meanwhile. Honestly, you just have to dig for it. Various sources report the lmeasures being taken and the hospitals being opened, reformatted, etc. I'm sorry OP. Mai to mobile ki fleshlight jalaunga hi vo bhi poore 9 min tak. The answer is pretty much - nothing has been done. India is headed for massive doom considering how bad the social distancing was in feb and march. If the US and Italy are any examples...the numbers are going to look worse for India. They need testing and wuhan style lockdowns for April to be able to control and treat the sick. These recent corona virus antics of Modi aren't mutually exclusive to OP's post. Both have their purpose. Placebo is a real thing just in case people have forgotten. Clapping slowly Many of the things you want to know are released here-

This is a symbolic thing, stop expecting answers for everything and survive the pandemic. If you find out, let us know. Our leader wants to know your address. For consultation purposes. wowww 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻kudos to her Very true 👍 I have only one question to people like these who would you have in modi place in the crises than? File an RTI or something [deleted] It's okay bro after the next couple of weeks we will be asked to wear new clothes and Post pics online. > I want to know what is being done to enable trans persons 

Can you elaborate please by what you mean by ""enable"" trans persons? What is disabling them to survive as compared to the cis gendered persons?

EDIT: I see a lot of people taking time to downvote my comment but no one bothered to answer my question. To clarify, i agree with the overall sentiment of the post. But i dont see the relevance of this specific point. Someone care to enlighten me? [deleted] All of the information you've asked for is available. > ""Look at the number of 'I's in your post. It's not all about you, you know""

-- Some narcissist First of all, it's a free democracy and nobody is forcing you to do any task which is not a necessity to tackle the situation!
This act is and always will be an option for you to perform, there is no ringmaster who will arrest you for not doing so!
But that does not mean, you go about doing some shit which will worsen the situation of this spread of Covid-19 under the name of democracy and free speech! There are laws for a reason and we must abide by them! jugaad Clowns should be invading to justify their ringmaster. Watch the drama... It's not mandatory to do so... Would have cared about this but the fact that the woman who tried to postpone the death of nirbhaya convicts said this, I can't sell my consciousness just to look cool. While the rest of the country would be lighting a candle in the balcony, I will be on my bed watching something exciting on porhub and jerking off. After 9 mins at least I will have something to show. Dear All,

https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/centre-seeks-sc-direction-that-no-media-should-publish-covid-19-news-without-first-ascertaining-facts-with-govt-154601 Well thanks to the mullahs we have even more positive patients around who won't be around for these Nation motivating events in the future... I wish the government (PMO department. They have the muscle to get all the data) hired people on payroll whose sole job will be to increase transparency and improve trust factor between the govt functioning and citizens. In this case, they can show a dashboard of PM cares donation and areas of usage intended/ actual money spent. Or, how is government allocating resources to tackle the mess or where does the money go from all the excise duty hikes or how much money has been spent on shit stuff (like statues) or how much money has been spent on bringing back Indians from other countries or how is pm cares different from pm relief fund.. 

Hire me PMO. I can setup a team track items of national interest. I can create awesome dashboards and visualise data points which is easy for Media and citizens to understand. I can really get behind the Numbers. A team of let’s say 10, and an annual salary impact of say 2 cr will be drop in ocean for you guys and this will go a long way in repairing some trust.",2020-04-03 23:41:28
