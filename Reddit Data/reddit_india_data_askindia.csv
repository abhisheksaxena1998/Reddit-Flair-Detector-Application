This is a very good initiative and deserves appreciation. 

Some suggestion:

- The current format brings attention but is not suitable to stimulate a discussion because of the wide variety of topics listed. Reddit works because each thread is about one topic (roughly put), and it attracts those who are interested in discussing that particular subject. 

- Instead of collecting everything in one single thread, I'd rather that the mods split them by topics into separate threads. 

- Personally, I feel the ""community policing"" model of reddit in general is failing because of vote manipulation by vested interests. (This initiative is a good example for this). 

- As such, I feel the mods here should be bolder - don't just help with the policing of the community but be more active contributors by becoming editors (or nominate or elect members from the community to be ""editors"").

- The task of of the ""editor"" should be as it is in any modern publication or media outlet - sift though the 100's or thousands of moderated content submitted everyday and highlight content that the r/india community should be more aware of, discuss and debate. 

- For this, the mods shouldn't be afraid to have more than 2 sticky threads on the front page. (In fact, personally I'd be comfortable with up to 5-6 stickies every day.)

- Thus stickies by community ""editors"" and the generally community contributed upvoted / debated content on the front page should make things more interesting here and also help more in creating harder to manipulate community with better content.

------------

Edit: On more thought, a simpler approach initially, could be to link to the relevant topic threads  here directly instead of linking to the news sources directly. While it would mean we have to click twice to read an article, but it would also stimulate discussion on the topic and address part of the problem I originally highlighted.

My grandparents are farmers in Andhra Pradesh.
He harvest 25 acres of land. In the past decade itself, I have not seen a single rice crop being harvested properly. There are at a stage where even in rural areas they need to buy rice.

When there is a good crop, the prices are down. 
They sell at 25kgs for ₹600-800. While in Delhi I buy at ₹2500/-. I can't understand this gross miscalculation. Farmer isn't getting it and we as a consumer paying more than thrice of it.

Coming to Auto sector, ""Maruti"" doesn't produce world class products in India. Taking an example of Swift model. There are many differences in Indian version and overseas version. So, if the sales slump in domestic market they can't even push it to overseas. It's a high time for these companies to produce high quality products. 

This government doesn't even know basic economics. How will they? They don't have even one person who has a sound market knowledge.
Giving loans to people like Neerav Modi and making him flee. While giving a free hand to income tax officers.

Irony.

Situation will only get worse. Don't worry. > The liquidity crunch has become tighter because it’s no longer as easy to do business. AIM Nonwovens sought refunds of Rs21 lakh for the Goods & Services Tax...

This bit boils my blood. The tax you have to pay is due immediately, but your input claims are never accepted on time, especially if it is a large amount. Idk if this idea is dumb but i think our cultural economy has so much potential and it's obviously being under utilised.

Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",abbawaddadu," Actually, corona virus is a great excuse for bjp to blame all their economical problems on. Now, for the next few years any question on economy will be diverged to blame corona virus. Like, how they blame 70 years of congress for most of Indias problems. Well written thoughts. 

This Corona Virus outbreak is a Godsend for this government to bury all their misgovernance and failures in economic policies in deep. 

When we recover from this virus, still they can continue to blame on the Virus until next General Election announced, and during that time the Islamic Monster will suddenly appear from BJP closets.

Yet Minister of State of Finance Anurag Thakur says ""no impact on Economy"". Nirmala doesn't care as she doesn't invest in stocks. Modi is fakir aadmi. Unsurprisingly chaddy gaumutra drinkers dont have any come back to this kind of facts.

Not only has yes bank failed but with Supreme court order on Vodafone AGR dues, this is likely to cause over 20,000 crore of NPAs on top banks, including SBI and IndusInd. It wont be surprising to see another bank fail and get saved by cashpayers money.

Moreover Vodafone a large international company failing due to GOI greed will be death knell of foreign investments into India. Imagine a govt so careless they allow such a large company such as vodafone to go bankrupt due to utter stupid policies. This govt has managed to destroy one of the most promising sectors telecom into a duopoly.

Even liquid funds are crashing hard as even GOI defaulting cannot be ruled out at this point. Lot of RBI money has gone into cleaning up the mess created by DeMo, GST, saving private banks, etc. While other countries are announcing several billion dollars of corona relief, there is nothing really left in terms of relief to Indian citizens.


During recession, you need actual economists like Manmohan Singh and Raghuram Rajan steering the ship, not war mongers like Anurag Thakur and Nirmala tai.

The sad thing is the govt will piggyback on the corona virus reason for the next 3 years for all the economic downturn- and trust me bhakts will buy it. I follow Indian markets for work and stuff.
Your govt has been giving tax benefits and stuff to the stock markets for some years now at the cost of a deficit budget.

Now in the face of a pandemic, things are go to shit.

Knowing politicos as they are, they will probably put up a smokescreen and try to distract over some useless stuff.

The only thing India has going for it roght now economically is that the crude oil has crashed while domestic rates have still been kept up through taxes which should help their budget

Edit: oh yeah and i forgot about the gst and demonitizibg debacle. That threw a cog in your machine too I believe it's a feature not a bug. Desperate insecure people are easier to manipulate and brainwashed towards blaming their misfortunes on whoever govt wants - minorities, migrants, opposition, etc. Clueless and Arrogant. That's the deadly combination out to destroy our economy and our lives. There is no 3d or 4d chess with this administration headed by Modikaka. They are incompetent, incoherent and incapable. Bhakts will not change. Source, My bf is bhakt and even after all this, he is still supporting BJP. I am damn sure , once this corona gets over , they will plan to build some big god figure statue to thank on how it saved us from corona.. and waste more money

Centre now doesnt have to invest time to divert people .. they now have corona to hide all thier poor performance and nonsensical decision making ..

On a main note , any suggestion on current market investment ? if at all one decides to enter when markets are down ? > Unsurprisingly chaddy gaumutra drinkers dont have any come back to this kind of facts. 

But soldiers are fighting at the .....err sorry the health care providers are risking their lives to battle this chinese made virus (which btw is a Chinese chaal) and you are asking such questions thereby demoralizing the country.

What you should rather be doing is to clap or bang your thaalis at 5 pm on Sunday during Janata Curfew (which in the interest of nation is going to happen after MP floor test - as congressi and commies are hand in gloves with these Cheeni people.

And yes - the Govt is fully prepared to handle such or more emergencies.  And dare you resist Corona cess (like Kargil cess) which will be surreptitiously introduced like excise tax increment on fuel and increase in GST on certain products and 5 folds increase on platform tickets. It speaks a lot about our economy when India’s 4th most popular bank faces problems like this. Yeah, I'm not m expecting any improvement in the economy until 2027. Even if we have the sense to vote in a non BJP govt in 2024, it will take them a few years to repair the damage What recession?

If one does NOT accept the existence of a problem, then the problem does NOT exist.

see.

/s I see lot of trolls and  complaints,  can we have productive alternatives to this for 2024 and above ? Mera Desh Badal raha hai Ulta chal raha hai Dogger modi I agree with what you said. Just mind well, using a language like ""Dear Sanghi morons"" only divides us further. I support no party. But, from my observation I feel everyone around me cheers for a political party as if they are Football clubs. Hooligans have a very different mentality, the more you alienate or single them out, the more moronic they'll act.

Problem is - we keep a party accountable not the position, not the entire body. We don't try to regulate and hold public forums to make sure right steps are being taken. Since fandom drives votes (or hacked EVMs), people who want progress can't do shit.

It's hard to fix, but unity and making everyone understand the big picture would be your first step. Not saying ""moron"" :)

If you ever managed large number of teams. You'd deal with under performers, critics, cynics, go getters,  etc - driving a change in such an environment requires openness, collaboration, incremental education and then subsequent lifts. Once those processes are in place, you feel that those that aren't contributing (cynics, people that are negative, etc) realize that their opinion isn't right and they shut up automatically. I think that's what our country needs right now.

You bring those ""morons"" in your community. Ask them to help work with you on a cause, test it incrementally and then move towards what works best. Everyone walks out happy. Denial is bad thing atleast they could accept things have gone bad At least we are not being run by scam artists.
Economic development > economic growth
I hate how you all are willing to go back to the scam era of India. Downvote me all you want. You just support the  evil gandu family. I hope you love your dreams of nepotism. Rip me out all you want, the truth hurts. It's not just Indian government. The whole world is not prepared for such an incident. I personally expected the economic bubble to burst for two years now. This time it happened due to a pandemic. The repercussions will be extreme and as usual the big businesses will be bailed out by the banks and government. 

The only solution for us Indians would be to -
1. Pay off all debts
Move from a debt economy to a savings based economy. The ones that our grandparents followed. 
2. Decentralisation
Power and opportunities should not get concentrated in big cities. There is pollution, population, lack of resources and chaos. We need to distribute industries and opportunities across towns and villages where people will no longer have to move to the city for a job. You are a fool if you think governments have anything to do with this pandemic. All governments of the world at puppets of the corporations and bankers. Grow balls and think critically. Vodafone related deal is not related to GoI greed, it started from 2007 with Hutchinson Essar, both Congress and BJP governments have maintained same position. It has something to do related to transaction made in tax heavens being liable to taxation if business is in India. 

I know some people don't like Modi or some people don't like Pappu, but understanding the situation is also important.",2020-03-20 08:25:32

I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",ringtring," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  ",2017-04-22 12:19:09

BJP doesn't know the way out of this because they've always lacked intellectual capacity. 

Their best bet is to ride the wave of polarization or hope the economy just bounces back on 'animal spirits' of India Inc Not going to lie. I knew this would be unearthed sooner or later.

Hell for the amount of toll we pay everytime we drive out of the city, we should be cruising on Autobahns at this point. 

Instead we spend thousands of bucks on RO cleaning ""drinking water"" (which is taxed again), and now we spend thousands on air purifiers for clean air. Seriously, what the fuck. 

We pay a shit ton of taxes and we get nothing. Where does the money go? This shit impacts you on a daily basis. Why aren't you angry? And even if you are, why does it only manifest itself as anger against Pakistan/Muslims/Lefties/Villain-of-the-day?

EDIT 2 : i have come to the conclusion that most of you find the fact and reason that i voted for modi hard to swallow.Yes i admit that i made a mistake when i thought he is a Guju and he might have a business plan for our country.Turns out he did have business plans but only for Ambani.It was ignorance on my part when i thought the 2002 incidents were not Modi's fault.Most of his other policies were not well thought and anti Muslim.You can all blame me for voting for Modi and still be chin deep in shit or Give reasonable contentions that might help.i personally don't like the idea of voting for Rahul.But now if i had to,i would choose Rahul over Modi.But wouldn't it be better if congress chose a new PM candidate like Tharoor.I have a hunch that Modi will not be around for long.Aggressive sophomaniac piece of shits need not reply.",SATAN08," It's too late now... don't you think? Dude imagine it's just the first year of his second term; and so much has happened. 4 years are still remaining I'm scared as fuck. Stop crying for daddy.  We wanted a suppository from decisive leader modi and he has been giving us doses like demo, gst, balakot CAA and now this. You will take this diblopment and keep voting for him or the next cattle bothered in 2024 while crying about how there is no other choice. Fuck you. Go back to WhatsApp. ""Rode the wave"" my ass. You knew this was coming. And believe me, you will be voting for Modi again in 2024. Sorry, brother. Modi has just about started with you and Shah is still lubing up. Yogi and others are in line too. You don't get to leave now till you get your vote's worth. Enjoy! ""I think Rahul Gandhi is stupid so I will vote for a party of murdering bigots""

Some of ya'll really dont have a sense of depth Manmohan Singh is 87 years old. If I were in his place, I would have shown middle finger to Indians and gone to some foreign country. We don't deserve him. You made it happen. 

Everyone knew it, BJP would enable this eventually. Still, people like you vote for him. 

But, good on you that you realized. “We didn’t know this was going to happen?”

Sorry, ignorant morons like you are the ones who enabled all of this to happen in the first place. 

You voted for development and casually chose to ignore incidents like 2002 and now you’re ranting about this? Good luck. It's Dr Manmohan Singh, not Mr. 😒 Are you from the same constituency as narendra ? Since you want a logical answer here it goes. 

India is a massive country which makes slow and steady progress. We move slowly and that is because we have a lot of inertia. But once we start moving, it is difficult to stop us. We didn't move our asses for close to 2 centuries to send off the Brits, but once we got together, it didn't take too long. This characteristic of ours carries on and is seen in our parliament. Bills take too long to go through and there is opposition from every group (logical because everyone has their own perspective). But once the discussions are done, implementation becomes easy. 

And this tardiness is hated by our generation. We need things to move fast and lack patience. So when we saw UPA going slow with the bills and everything, the hope of a strong leader who can hasten things was sold to people. And we lapped it up. However, we forgot that Indian politics runs on fake promises. We were given images of Gujarat's development, but few even bothered to check whether Modi was the guy who did it. (Fun fact: He wasn't). Thus, our newfound hope, Modi become the PM who would deliver us unto the New India. Nobody paid attention to the 2002 riots or maybe they thought he would have learnt from his mistakes. But lest we forget, it is the RSS that holds the reins now. 


I am okay with you if you voted for him in 2014. If you did vote for him in 2019, you better get off your arse and protest like there is no tomorrow for you fell for the rhetoric of patriotism.

Edit: Congress can do whatever the fuck they want (like sticking with Pappu). Similarly, you can do whatever the fuck you want. You can go protest or spread the truth about this government or work for the development of the society. The choice is yours. Even an Ape is better than Modi as the PM as long it doesn't make the citizens kill each other. How about Shashi tharoor? Rahul Gandhi is not a retard. Narendra Modi's problem is not that he is a narcissist. His problem is that he is a terrorist. Anyone is better that Modi. Especially Rahul. He would actually listen to others such as MMS. People who voted for modi for the second time are the worst. I would give the first time a pass because he was promising development. The second time only thing he promised was this and that's why they are the worst. They knew what he stood for they knew how crooked and dumb he was rafale, demo etc all happened the first term. They only way these people could get worse is saying stuff like Rahul is bad. You guys choose modi after you knew what he did and what he was capable of. Everybody knew this was going to happen especially in 2019. Everybody knows what the rss is. Everyone knew about the 2002 riots. And everyone knew all the bs about Rahul  was just pr. And you believed all that and still do. His quote ""History will be kinder to me than the contemporary media and the opposition parties in parliament"" has never been so damn true. Let's be realistic. He is very old. There are many talented people in congress too. I sincerely hope tharoor's rebel against gandhi family succeed. Not that Rahul gandhi is all bad. But BJP has made his such image so that it is very unlikely for public to support him over few years. He should accept it and keep low profile for few years. Voting for Modi in 2014 is forgivable but not in 2019. If you voted in 2014, then you should be fine. Koi lautaa de mere beete hue din ! Btw Manmohan Singh's term was the highest on corruption. There were new scandals every day. I don't know which one was worse.

Congress let all their minister loot the whole country. Now they victim-blame all the time. They could have done something good, but they didn't. They are the reason for their demise Modi is our only hope peoples of India ... He is your saviour this man has the power to liberate the country from the 800 years long slavery by those foreign powers ... This is your only chance to ride the wave and demolish the empire of those growing powers and bring back the ancient and long gone glory of this nation and it's people.... 
।। नमो नमो ।। We could have Arvind Kejriwal as our PM but nobody voted for him.

I know he was not perfect. But he improved a lot over the years with experience. Most importantly he is a decent person at heart.

More of us should give young politicians/parties a chance rather than voting based on religion.",2020-02-26 10:42:06
Policy/Economy,Central Government has failed to even approve COVID19 diagnostic kits.

It seems the govt is clueless about even providing testing kits clearances. How can you expect such a clueless government to provide the best response for a fast spreading pandemic?

Modi era has made me definitely more philosophical. Only when a judge from SC gets a lot of their money stuck due to de-monet. I think between SC and Modi, the latter is still wiser at the moment no matter what your standings leanings are. You might not agree with demonetization. But SC (judicative!) making the rules (legislative!) about national anthem is just unacceptable. The government (Modi) might have executive orders with temporary effect.

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

In the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence.",decipherseattle," They did the same thing in 2018, when crude oil prices fell, they increased taxes on petrol and diesel.

Since the strategy worked so well before, of course they will try it again. Chutiye hain, they are only trying to help out their financiers, corporate donors.

**India Can Become Powerhouse Economy If Policies Managed Well, Says IMF** 

 ______ 
If economic policies are managed well India will be a powerhouse economy, IMF
has said

**Washington: **

India can become a powerhouse economy if policies are managed well and reforms
are supportive of inclusive growth, a top IMF official has said.

David Lipton, the International Monetary Fund's First Deputy Managing
Director, also expressed hope that India's growth will be reflected in poverty
reduction statistics and eventually in a measurement of metrics of inclusion.

""If policies are managed well and reforms are supportive of inclusive growth,
India's economy could become a powerhouse economy. It is already, I think the
10th largest, but with the population and the growth rate there's more
potential,"" he told news agency PTI.

""I've said there's more to be done. There are further reforms both in terms of
consolidating the budget situation to ensure that there's never an incident of
doubt about fiscal finances in terms of making the banking system more
competitive and dealing with the legacy problems of NPAs (non- performing
assets),"" he said.

He said the important job was not just to recapitalise, but to change the
governance and change the competitiveness so that banks serve as a positive
force by allocating credit well and being a driving force in the economy .

__ Comments

Asked about IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde's remarks that she does
not expect any major economic reforms in an election year, Mr Lipton said:
""It's always a difficult to make policy during election years.

""We certainly hope that there can continue to be a progress, but it's really
the judgement of the politicians, the government about what can be done when"".

This mass exodus of migrant workers is what happens when a government is myopic to the point of blindness. A proper plan could and would have prevented this. A proper stimulus package planned in advance, and not one quickly put together in reaction to this, should have been there. This mass exodus has many, many, many problems surrounding it. For one, can you imagine people turning into nomads overnight when food and water that's usually available everywhere is missing thanks to a lockdown? Can you imagine, how these men, women, and children are supposed to *walk* hundreds of kilometers in absence of public transport? It's beyond cruel what the Centre has compelled these already oppressed groups of people to do right now. These migrant workers will also (many already are) face the brutality of lathi-happy cops. With state borders locked, they will essentially remain nomads, unless proper arrangements are made for them.  And, worst of all, these migrant workers, who don't have the luxury to wash hands for twenty seconds with soaps (can't afford soaps, can't afford to waste what little water they have), how are they supposed to remain safe from the pandemic? It's also equally likely that they make take the coronavirus along with them to their villages. And let's not forget that rural public healthcare is already in shambles. Those rushing to fellate the prime minister for his ""brave"" and ""strong"" step do not fucking understand how this lockdown has already disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

Lockdown should have been done giving enough timeframe and means to people to reach their home. Instead it was done almost over night and hence these problems.

Policy/Economy,Opinion: BJPs policies have alienated a large section of Middle Class Hindus,136,f15kgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f15kgm/opinion_bjps_policies_have_alienated_a_large/,55,"One of India's Election Commissioners, Ashok Lavasa, in a brilliant [recent ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-difficulty-of-being-honest-prevention-of-corruption-act-ashok-lavasa-election-commission-of-india-6188078/)article  wrote,""People are generally good; they are also generally timid"". And I think it defines our middle classes perfectly.

India has always had an aspirational middle class. This middle class is largely moderate, driven by ambitions of economic prosperity and social stability (just like the middle classes of any other country). They want to be socially and economically upwardly mobile, resent overtly divisive policies with uncertain ends and are busy in their lives (thus the timidity).

Now, the point of a democratic society is democratic changes (a.k.a gradual changes). There's a reason we're regarded as elephants and China's as a dragon. We praise China for what they've done with their economy but hold dear what we have i.e our voice.

Modi Govt seems to be constantly stirring the pot with radical policies. This has started affecting the lives of a common Indian more than ever, and negatively too. Modi supporter or not, demonetisation, for example, in hindsight, is uniformly chided for being wasteful and avoidable.

Middle and lower middle classes will now increasingly start disassociating with what this govt stands for. The CAA crackdown, kashmir situation but most importantly the incompetent handling of the economy will soon have them looking for viable alternatives. A BJP, which for the longest time stood for economic liberalisation, corruption-free politics, efficient governance - atleast in the minds of the educated - now stands exposed with its vitriolic campaigns and its ineptitude to handle nuanced issues like the Kashmir problem. 

I see a political vacuum forming soon, and a desperate search for alternatives by the upwardly mobile middle and lower middle classes and an opportunity for something new.",Sulh-i-kul," > A BJP, which for the longest time stood for economic liberalisation, corruption-free politics, efficient governance - atleast in the minds of the educated - now stands exposed with its vitriolic campaigns and its ineptitude to handle nuanced issues like the Kashmir problem. 

Anybody who's followed the history of the BJP has always been aware that the BJP stands for none of what you've mentioned. 

Hate and vitriol have always been their identity, backed by protectionism, corruption, and incompetence. They were pretty smart in messaging during 2013 and 2014 with promises for jobs and economic growth. Now their ineptitude has been exposed and they veil has come off. No wonder this isn’t what people voted for. progressive & liberal in the office/onsite jobs/internet/school/college , archaic and conservative at home.  This is the average middle class household, being ""educated"" doesn't help. India's middle class is very conservative and believes in bigotry. I don't think think they are even close to being moderates. Perhaps not. Take a look at this comment on another thread.

> I talked to a friend who had worked for a BJP think tank, he told me BJP people aren't stupid, they polarize because his think tank and other companies have literally done data analytics stuff to show it works. They submit reports subtly suggesting keeping these policies running in nice white binders professionally typed out in English and with impeccable grammar to Amit Shah, Fadnavis, Modi, everyone. It's literally cause and effect. These guys are calculative thinkers, they don't care about religion and cow either, whatever makes them rich and keeps their friends happy. If the majority somehow starts becoming atheist overnight, BJP will literally start singing about eliminating religion tomorrow. I honestly want to blame the people for being so fucking dumb in the first place.

There are several votebanks in operation for BJP. There is the core RSS votebank, the Modi votebank, the development votebank, a newly minted SC/ST/OBC votebank and so on. The development votebank is fast disappearing, true. And probably turning into an anti Modi votebank. But the rest are new, believers in **what Modi has been doing since 2014** and they remain steadfast.

End of the day, the total anti BJP voter share in India is higher than BJP's vote share, all put together. But there is no one to bring those votes all across India against BJP. There is no leadership, no unity, no clear strategy. I like your optimism The fundamental truth that I have learned about Indian politics is that it is dependent not on ideology, policy or party allegiance but largely on cult of personality. We have had people like Bal Thackeray who was never elected to any position but controlled the politics of one of the largest states and one of the most important cities of the country for decades. Gandhi's,  Jaya Lalitha, MSG, Mamta Banerjee the list goes on and on. 

Modi has created a cult of personality for himself that even opposition candidates are fearful of attacking him directly (rather than trading barbs with Amit Shah or BJP MLA's). Until an opposition party with cross national muscle has a leadership figure who can cultivate a cult of personality around himself to oppose Modi, there will be no real power vacuum at the national level.

Congress is dead behind Rahul Gandhi, no other opposition party has a nationally relevant figure. Future I could see is with AAP/Kejriwal who has moulded himself into the archetype of middle-class Indian man, but AAP have years if not decades of work ahead of them to build a national party rather than a regional one. Lauda kuch nahi hone wala. This country is full of chutiyas. BJP will win again at the national level because Congress has shat the bed. I so hope somehow Kejriwal sir does well in Delhi again in the next 4 years and he can form a good opposition to the Nazi Sanghi squad. Middle class in India is tiny percentage of population. BJP knows they can take them for granted They had this great opportunity after revoking 370, win the confidence of people there, bring stability. Instead they installed a dick of a governer who is bullshitting and their ministers from other states giving statements that they will go and buy lands there.

CAA is still debatable by NRC is throwing at the fan above you

In no time, local news channels flashed celebratory headlines and even recalled that the same credit ratings agency had downgraded India’s outlook to negative only last month.
Far from trumping our eastern neighbour, we are not even close to them when it comes to international credit ratings. On a scale of 1-21, we rank 16th, while arch-rival India ranks 9th.

>In the latest review, Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s outlook to positive, which simply means that the country’s economy is moving in a positive direction. But it didn’t increase Pakistan’s credit rating, which remains at B3 –  the level it has been maintaining since June, 2015.
>India, on the other hand, stands at Baa2 or seven notches better than Pakistan on Moody’s scale.

https://www.samaa.tv/money/2019/12/no-pakistans-credit-rating-is-not-better-than-indias/amp/ Actually I read an article where it was mentioned that places where some kind of political turmoil subsides and things begin to calm down, there is a sudden increase in foreign investment opportunities. The example of Egypt was given in the article, that right after Arab Spring or Hossini Mubarak was voted out and the coupe and after all that, Egypt became very lucrative for foreign investment. Pakistani here, been following our economy closely so may be able to shed more light on this.

Moody is not saying that Pakistan is a better place to invest than India or that Pakistan's economy is better than India's right now. 

What it is saying is that its outlook for Pakistan is positive while its outlook for India is negative. This means that, according to their assessment, India's economy will be worse than it is right now in the future while Pakistan's will be better than it is right now

How is Pakistan doing this? Pakistan has had some strict policies, which the general population is hating because all imported goods are now much more expensive, life is harder for us right now. However, through this policy Pakistan has drastically lowered exports, which has 'improved' our trade deficit. 

Pakistan's current government has many similar policies which are targeting macroeconomic indicators to strengthen the economy. Our previous government was artificially inflating the rupee (the rate was around 100pkr per USD) by selling its dollar reserves and buying rupees. The current government stopped doing this and let the rupee reach its actual value. The rupee went from 100 to 150 per USD in the matter of a few months, but it is now stable and slowly starting to improve

On the other hand, Indian government is doing stuff like demonetization and fudging economic numbers to make itself look good. Moody basically looked at the way both countries are being run and assessed that Pakistan is improving because they are willing to take hard decisions to improve the economy, while India is, uh, doing other things Investors in Pakistan having a blast Kashmir masterstroke coming home to roost. 

Most Indians don’t realize what a Pandora’s box that has opened up. 

When the MEA says that the greatest defense obstacle for India’s progress is its unresolved borders that bloat the armed forces, and then the same government unilaterally decides to massively change the status quo without taking into account external threats, and ends up making it so that now China claims all of Ladakh(South-Tibet) and is constantly upping the ante on neighboring countries like Nepal to take up border issues with India, not to mention the uptick in incursions in the North East.

So now India is bleeding resources on self inflicted wounds while the adversary gets to sit back, focus on building internal strength, and cry foul about the human rights violations that tarnish India’s image and economic desirability. 

Indians can act like the repeated bashing’s in premier western publications are worthless but all these add up to form public and investor perception, this will have long term consequences and they are already coming to fruition. You keep saying Go To Pakistan. Everyone is going there... Is this the same Moody's that gave CDOs with subprime mortgages a AAA rating? Ofcourse, who doesn't like to be shot in their head once in a while.",2019-12-03 23:44:27
Policy/Economy,"Delhi Government today raised the minimum wage to highest for any state in the country, after SC ruled in their favour. Almost 3 times as much as UP. Will immediately benefit 55 lakh workers.",283,dooafc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dooafc/delhi_government_today_raised_the_minimum_wage_to/,102,"Delhi government had tried to raise the minimum wage in 2017 but this had been taken to court by a number of associations of employers. High Court ordered against the hike in 2018, which was then appealed to Supreme Court. 

Delhi government then constituted a Minimum Wage Advisory Committee in November 2018 that finalised the wages. This amounts to Rs14,842/month for unskilled workers, which was submitted before the Supreme Court. The SC has now accepted Delhi Government's proposal. 

Comparison with some other states:

> Delhi ₹14842

> Haryana ₹8827

> UP ₹5750

> Gujarat ₹8190

> Maharashtra ₹10411

> [National Minimum Wage](https://thewire.in/labour/delhi-minimum-wake-hike) ₹ 4,576 (recommended, but not implemented ₹9,750) 

Of course Delhi has a higher cost of living, but I can't imagine other cities like Lucknow being 3 times cheaper. Therefore other state governments also need to look at their wages and revise them. 


> A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Aniruddha Bose, in an order passed on October 14, permitted the Delhi government to bring into effect its draft proposal to revise minimum wages of unskilled labourers to ₹14,842, ₹16,341 for semi-skilled, ₹17,991 for skilled workers, ₹16,341 for non-matriculates, ₹17,991 for matriculates who are not graduates and ₹19,572 for graduates and above.

> In an affidavit filed on August 26 this year, the Delhi government said it has proposed the revised minimum wages taking into consideration “the average prices of food items and clothing component and other prescribed percentage of other components i.e. housing, light & fuel and education/social obligation”.

> https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sc-allows-aap-govt-to-revise-minimum-wages/article29817076.ece

Delhi had earlier removed more than 1300 contractors from working for the government because they were not paying the prescribed minimum wage.",kash_if," Whoa! I just realized how much less I was paid for my job. Internship is still a loophole Question: Do the employers actually pay such minimum wages? Not just Delhi, in any place. India has minimum wage? It is a good step. Although many unskilled workers' work is not documented and is paid whatever the employer feels like one would agree to work on. 

Currently, in NCT Delhi daily wage worker/ contract based/ dihadi majdoor / construction labors are paid around 300 rs /day for 10 hrs of work. 

So not much is changed however what has been done is commendable. Curious - how much merit is there to concerns of labour intensive businesses migrating to other states? This sounds good on paper. But **it is a good step if and only if the government has factored in whether the business industry can afford the additional cost.** This is why it is important to talk to the industry too. Otherwise, the industries will just move their factories to other states causing a huge job loss in Delhi. And the businesses who remain will be forced to increase their price to be in business making everything for the consumers in Delhi costlier. 

This will probably end up as a costly learning experience to the inexperienced AAP government - **if you side only with the workers it's communism, and if you only support the corporates it's capitalism**. And both these models won't work in India. That is why it is important to talk to both parties to understand each others problem, and then create policies that address them.

-------------

**Edit**: As an example of considering a lot of things when making a policy - free education for all sounds like a great idea. Until you factor in the reality that you then have to create jobs for all these educated people. And you would also drive down the cost of labour with so many educated people seeking jobs. This is why education in India (and other countries) is deliberately affordable to only a certain section of society or to the exceptional (scholarships). That is why education is only free up to the level our economy can accommodate (currently at school levels, as offered in government schools). This is why it is important to talk with every stakeholder when making a policy. Hopefully AAP has done this.

-------------------

For those interested, [Minimum Wages For States Across India](https://www.simpliance.in/minimum-wages). It's a good move. Depending on how strictly they are followed it can have direct and indirect effects on the wage curve. And I think the indirect effects is what the companies are scared of, because it cost them more. So they will try to find loopholes or have undocumented work done. Wow, I was paid 15,000 bucks for 6 days a week, 8 hours a day and I had an MA in psychology. Depressing as fuck. Also, we pay our maids way less than the minimum wage in Maharashtra, looks like. why won't they vote for them first free travel for women in DTC now this Highest in the country? I think Kerala has a minimum wage of 18000 , correct me if iam wrong I don't understand why this is such big news, the central minimum wage for unskilled labour in Cat A centres has been 15,184 per 26 calendar days of 8 hours each with 2x for overtime since April and it's expected to be revised again this month.

These rates are religiously followed by Central govt/PSUs for contract labour. The Delhi govt. is not even matching this figure.

Edit: the rates have been revised upwards since October 1, 2019. >	Comparison with some other states:

>Maharashtra ₹10411

I would literally have to fire half my staff if this was ever actually enforced. 

Regulations should be made based on what's plausible and enforceable. These 'best case' regulations are fucking stupid. It just encourages people to do underhanded shit. Now see industries shift from Delhi. 

Atleast this will reduce the pollution. [deleted] Kejriwal and Bernie Sanders are so damn similar.

Kejriwal raised it to around Rs 15k per month
Bernie wants to raise it to 15$ per hour My only disappointment during the election was that AAP didn't gain a foothold in other states in india.

Policy/Economy,Moody’s lowers India’s GDP growth forecast to 5.3 per cent in 2020 on coronavirus implications on the economy.,59,fk0dx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fk0dx5/moodys_lowers_indias_gdp_growth_forecast_to_53/,3," Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday lowered India’s GDP growth forecast for 2020 calendar year to 5.3 per cent, on coronavirus implications on the economy.  

 February projected a 5.4 per cent real GDP growth for India in 2020. This too was a downgrade from 6.6 per cent earlier forecast. 

 “A number of governments and central banks have announced countervailing measures, including fiscal stimulus packages, policy rate cuts and regulatory forbearance; however, the effectiveness of policy easing will be blunted by measures to contain the outbreak, and policy space is constrained for some sovereigns,” 

 Moody’s said oil price shock adds to growth and fiscal pressures for exposed sovereigns. “A period of lower oil prices will further weigh on the economic and fiscal fundamentals of oil exporters, while mitigating the trade shock for importers.”

He was in control only because he controlled the police and media. The courts were also controlled by him and thus no real justice was possible. 

Ring a bell? Read on. 

He ruled only for the vested big industry and land owners. They made policies and he simply was their puppet. Farmers were in distress and yes you also had farmer suicide but the Tsar didn't care because his sycophants told him he was the best Tsar ever and that the Economy and people were in great shape?

 Ding ding ding. 

Now in 1904 and 1905 began a series of mass democratic protests, all inorganic and a will of the people. Did the Tsar listen to them? No, he ignored them at best and at worst unleashed his army and police on unarmed masses murdering them by the 1,000's. 

You have made the connection haven't you. 

As this was all making the Tsar look bad, a group of fascists called the Black Hundreds, supported by the police came up. Like the RSS today they were a fascist mob who used the support of the state to silence dissenting voices by violence. Now go read about them and you will see that they mirror the RSS exactly. A summary from Wikipedia. 

>The Black Hundreds were also noted for extremism and incitement to pogroms, nationalistic Russocentric doctrines, different xenophobic beliefs, including anti-Ukrainian sentiment[4] and anti-semitism.

Replace russocentric with Hindutva and anti Ukrainian with Bangladesh and semitism with Islam and you have the exact same Ideology. 

Whenever a peaceful protest came up, these thugs will show up, murder the peace loving protestors while the police turned a blind eye. 

This is exactly the same as India under the Fascist thug Modi.

Policy/Economy,Narendra Modi is damaging India’s economy as well as its democracy,195,dn9up5,https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/10/24/narendra-modi-is-damaging-indias-economy-as-well-as-its-democracy,79,,News24x7Live," But voters are voting for BJP. If they are happy to get shafted, what can we do? Bharat mata ki jay!!

                                 -- argument khatam Demand for a complete democracy and stable economy is anti-hindu and anti-india. Isn’t it’s too early to say this? /s I have seen more critical news from The Economist and New York Times in past 1-2 years than any other Indian news outlet. Economist especially is going bonkers in recent times. Someone legit told me ki ""gst ane se efficiency itna badh gaya that vehicles are making the trip faster. Hence less trucks needed. "" 

My husband asked him, ""toh fir personal vehicles main bhi demand kam kyu hua.""

Silence on the other side. Government bus increased in Maharashtra directly by 5rs up from 25 to 30 after the results. Not just narendar chodi, but also the majority of bigots in India who support him/vote for him and defend his actions with baseless logic. 
They are equally to blame. This guy is illiterate, probably hasn't seen the world from the perspective of us redditors, and is just like an outlet for their bigotry along with rss propaganda. He tells people what they want to hear. He sells people what they want. People buy what they want. 
I think it's time we face the fact that not just this one guy, but the majority of the Indian population is fucked up in the head and *THAT* is what we need to repair and change. https://outline.com/VpSRFs People who voted for Modi, don't expect him to fix economy !

They want him to trouble Pakistan, talk about Ayodhya temple & cows, do massive rallies abroad, but most importantly to generally piss off muslims/christians citizens.
 
He has been excelling in all of those. No no we are best economy^/s No matter who comes in power, as long as the IAS still make policies, we will have a shitty economy. * Bad exports policy. [Textile exports](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/indian-textile-sector-losing-edge-in-international-market-citi/article29184896.ece), [software exports](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/indias-software-exporters-may-lose-based-on-falling-incentives-and-rising-tax-rates/70743190). We are no longer able to compete with other nations in various sectors.
* High taxes on transactions. An example from the advertising industry is the [6% equalization levy](https://cleartax.in/s/equalisation-levy](https://cleartax.in/s/equalisation-levy) charged on online advertising expenditure (If you spend 100 rs. on ads on Google, Facebook, or any online advertising platform, you have to pay Rs. 6 on the ad spend, making it Rs. 106, an overhead of Rs. 6 on your business.). This has made Indian advertising businesses and businesses requiring online advertisement, incompetent in the international arena. If your expenditure is Rs. 100 on ads, you'll have to pay Rs. 6 as an overhead to the Indian govt as a levy, making the cost Rs. 106.
* Exorbitant GST rates on various services and goods.
* Ease of doing business has decreased due to increased filing requirements for corporations and small businesses.
* Quick to ban, but not quick enough to regulate. Example: Cryptocurrency ban by the RBI. 

There are many things this Govt. is doing right as well, such as increasing the minimum turnover required for a business to register on GST. However, a major policy overhaul is required to boost competitiveness against countries with relatively relaxed tax policies to bring foreign money into India. Oh thanks for giving us an existential crisis right there !! >	The country at last has a leader with the power and the incentives to push through big reforms. But he is not acting

Oh, but he is Narendra Modi is NOT damaging anything! WE, the people of India ARE. We are failing as a democracy if we continue to elect him and his party on the basis of pseudo nationalism and Hinduism. In the long run, the country will get what it deserves. Comment 'aye' if you love reading the Economist. I wait on Thursday nights for it to come out. But listen. Arent you glad you knew about the shitbags before you made something good here and then saw it torn down by assholes? 

Atleast now, you have better idea of where to invest personal effort. By exploiting our people, not adulating them. The basic premise is fear. Some random guy says that he can solve all the problems and the public laps it up. Even though the person has no proven record or worse is known to be incompetent, fear drives mob crazy and we end up with leaders like Trump and Modi who promise everything under the heavens to the masses. I am astounded by the hate most of r/Indian have against Modi.

And all these 20 year old believe they know how economic reforms work. But hay who am I to question. Damaging?  ... It's been done already. I am dull when it comes to economy , can someone elucidate what policies affected our economy negatively ? One thing I noticed is inflation increased by 2-3 times in last 10 years. on a serious note, do we have a better option? Every economy in the world is shrinking at the moment and facing global slowdown https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2019/07/18/WEOupdateJuly2019 I think op is right.

Policy/Economy,‘India in the midst of growth recession': Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan,127,e7r6rk,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/india-midst-growth-recession-former-rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-113681,16,,Infinidimenterprise," From what I gather there's a kind of lethargy in the economy, like despite having capital people don't want to invest it. Any potential solutions to this problem. there is fear among everyone.muslims fearing about religion based crimes, industrialists fearing govt policies, middle class fearing losing jobs. then there are idiot politicians who instead of caring about this are making absurd comments defying all logic all science. Unless fundamentals improve, there won’t be private investment . If the government cuts jobs, investment, the vicious circle is complete. A bit  related question : 

Since markets are down, will it be good to invest in some of the good company shares for long term ? The greatest trick thats been played on the common masses has been the trickle down effect. The government caters to the problems of big multinational companies, and big lenders and hoping that the effect trickles down the pyramid to the lower section of the society. Decrease tax rates for wealthy because it would somehow improve situation for the other 98%.


Fuck this shit. I want the government to fucking care about common people instead. Make policies that benefit the 99% instead of the fucking 1% that have been increasing their share of the pie for years now. Economy is better when there is better circulation of money. The fact is that once the rich sense a weakness in the economy, they pull out. They invest elsewhere or just keep it to themselves. It leaves less for the other 99% and that's what we are seeing now.

Companies don't want to hire people because there is a lack of consumers. People are unemployed or working on much lower incomes which means they can only spend on what's necessary. Youth are not going for higher education because there are no jobs to get with those higher qualifications. This is an irreversible event the effects of which will be seen for years to come. A section of a generation that is undereducated and has low job experience in their formative years, and it can't be reversed now. The colleges have closed down and that can't be reversed. Companies have closed down and that can't be reversed either.

The thing is that common man ki gaand me itna dum nahi hai ki wo bahar ke deshon me money spend/invest kare. Or in immovable assets. These actions are reserved for the 1%. If common man has some extra money, what is he gonna do with it? He's not gonna deposit it into swiss bank accounts. In the end, the guy is going to spend it here:

- Buy a car: automobile industry profits
- Buys a home/flat: Real estate and construction
- drugs/prostitutes: unorganised skilled labour(?)
- better food: Groceries, Resturants, Farmers
- Start a business: The whole fucking economy+ more jobs
- Gadgets: Electronic industry, shops + jobs
- Health: Healthcare, Better life for common man is also supposed to be a goal for a government
- Education: Better generation of workers. Greater skills. Education industry

We've seen the top down approach and it's fucked the economy and I for one am pretty sick of it. The rich have become richer and they don't give two shits about you and me. Humari gaand bachane koi bahar se nahi aega, this is real life not a fucking movie. We have to vote based on the policies of the politicians.

My father tells me that *Ese hi chalta aya hai, when Congress was in power they did the same and now BJP is doing the same. Same shit, different toilet. The government has to bow down to the demands of the elites*. Who says we are restricted by these two options. Vote based on policies not party lines. Unless we vote based on the demands of the common man, no one would give a fuck about the demands of the common man.

Jai Hind. Still Sensex is making new highs, makes zero sense to me. Is ""growth recession"" one of the most unnecessary oxymorons in the English language.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.

Policy/Economy,What the fuck is modi doing ?,3,fmob0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmob0d/what_the_fuck_is_modi_doing/,5,"What the fuck is modi doing ? He's unfit to be leader of this country. 

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy. 

Now what ? World's largest democracy' economy is probably will be in ruins by the time this is all over. 

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt. Industrial activities will be delayed as demands will be greatly reduced due to depletion of people's cash reserves.",UsualEducation," None of this is new. He has always been doing PR giri only. It is not so much modi as the voting public, and lack of competent opposition. Yatha praja, tatha raja. Public who voted for him knew this already. You can't counter idiots with logic. They will still support him. Yes no one is talking about it. But I've seen many documentaries about our economic condition (I'm no expert but I've heard what experts been saying). This bubble was building up by the time of Congress but Manmohan was very smart. True that loans were high in that time too. But when you are in economic boom you're supposed to give loans to companies and take calculated risk. But now the loans are about 5-6 time higher, unemployment is 45 years high, bad loans have gone 3 to 9%. The bubble have been burst. Experts say normally it takes a decade to come out of this condition. That's why it is called lost decade.
Now it was before corona. Lol. Get ready to go into stone age guys. What can he do best ? He can charm the people to stay home. Most of his tv appearances in recent times have been very intense. I guess people take his words. 
What hurts me the most is where are the Ambani’s the Adanis the Virat Kohli’s the Dhoni’s the salmans the shahrukhs.  And the countless other billionaires of india.   They should come forward and donate money towards this epic fight against  Covid 19. Ghanta bajaao",2020-03-22 06:24:40

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis**

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

Policy/Economy,India's forsaken IT / BPO and other professionals post COVID-19 breakout and Lock-down.,6,fqqi9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fqqi9p/indias_forsaken_it_bpo_and_other_professionals/,0," As of 5th of March NASSCOM had sought permission from Govt to allow Work from Home [WFH](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/coronavirus-nasscom-urges-govt-to-allow-techies-to-work-from-home/amp_articleshow/74487287.cms) to deal with COVID-19 & permission granted by the 13th of March. Most of the IT companies did start allowing Work from Home (wfh) for a majority of their employees. But some were left out from this under the pretext of essential work for banks such as Wells Fargo. They were forced to work from Office and only after much hue and cry and police raids did they allow the employees to take the desktops home as late as 24th March. This has opened a scope for the spread virus since the virus can still be transmitted amongst employees with out the employee showing any sign.

It has also come to notice that unofficially many employees were threatened of pay cut if they are unable to take the desktops home in spite of 24th Mar lockdown.


The pertinent question arises as to what happens when these employees and their families are found to be infected..? Will they have complete access to health care under company policy? But then, what about their family?

How will they manage their expense if there is mass lay-offs? Given that they are considered too rich to receive ration from govt and too poor to receive grants in the form of bail-outs.

Signs are not encouraging, given that top officials of [corporates](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-25/billionaires-want-people-back-to-work-workers-aren-t-so-sure) (including retired) are not providing encouraging statements (though overseas it will have rippling affect in India) & many companies [like this](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/coronavirus-impact-future-groups-kishore-biyani-in-a-difficult-situation-as-lenders-invoke-shares-report-5070601.html/amp) are already finding excuse of pre-existing loans which signals deferment  of salary pay, for many if not all.

Steps by RBI seems [encouraging](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rbis-3-month-moratorium-on-term-loans-credit-card-dues-emis-included-interest-to-accrue-on-outstanding-portion-of-loan-5080581.html) but it still leaves a gaping hole in the pockets of the professionals.

Note: Do leave your comments or DM me if your company/your acquaintance’s company is still making their employees work in these hazardous times or threatening pay-cut. Will post it here so that awareness is generated.",Pheonix-_,,2020-03-29 03:17:29
Policy/Economy,Ex-PM Manmohan Singh: The state of economy today is deeply worrying. Last quarter's GDP growth rate of 5% signals that were in midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has potential to grow at a much faster rate but all round mismanagement by Modi govt has resulted in this slowdown.,658,cy66pf,https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1168025028916465665?s=19,120,,Gavthi_Batman," Let's not forget, 5 is the biggest *answer* they could come up with. A colleague was saying ""educated people should never run country they cannot take brave steps like Modi does"".. People seriously don't care about economy all they care about is Pakistan and Kashmir. BJP is doing right ... We are fucked boys More on current situation:

>Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh: It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector's growth is tottering at 0.6%. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the govt to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.


In such distressed time for economy, even [few words](https://twitter.com/INCIndia/status/1168018140971905024?s=19), even a criticism (though he rarely criticize anybody) by him is like rain in drought...

Wish he had majority in parliament like the incumbent PM, wish he could implement his knowledge and experience to grow India into superpower... My father runs a business in the automotive industry and says that this is the worst slowdown he's seen is 25 years. He says even 2008 was better and that was during a global recession. Factories halting or running 2/7 days, bodyshops shutting down or halting orders etc(throughout India). These are really troubling times. I hope that change is forced quickly or we'll stunt ourselves for a really long time. I don't know how competent the people in charge of the decisions regarding finances are. 

You just pick anyone random and make him/her the finance Minister. I know they don't make the decisions themselves, have a team of supposedly experts behind them, but I won't be surprised if the so called experts may also just be bootlickers rather than competent individuals.

And it should not be tough to find competent people in our country. Check out the comments in any article reporting the same.. bhakths out in full force abusing him..to solve a problem you have to admit that you have one. Cow economics and ram mandir finally taking effect. Acche din bros. He's not wrong. This guy is hands down *the* greatest Prime Minister the country has ever had. No politics, no drama, no braggadocio, no bullshit. He wasn't tainted by crises like Indira Gandhi or Nehru, either. He was all work and no talk. He singlehandedly pulled India out of the mouth of a potential economic depression in 1991 and helped set it on the right track as Prime Minister. 2004 to 2009 saw stratospheric economic growth and even 2009-2014, despite the global financial turbulence, was pretty impressive. No amount of praise will be enough for his contributions to India's growth story. 

But, today's hateful, terrorist-electing India doesn't deserve him. Today's India deserves Yogi Adityanath, Sakshi Maharaj, Pragya Singh Thakur, Amit Shah and that failed theater actor-cum-riot-monger.

PS: Enjoy the Hindutva way of running an economy, India. Just another 5 years. Or maybe 50. Make the most of it anyway. Condition of bhakturds in 4 months of Modi 2.0 
https://twitter.com/free_thinker/status/1168042369909805057 Man, I miss good old of Days of Manmohan Singh.. Remember we used to have an economy ? Now what we have is just shit and giggles I think after the end of this term Modi will have a hard time gaining popularity. Mody govt how to solve -- DENY Could anyone estimate how low the GDP will be if we had the old non fudged formula?? We chutiya Indians deserve such economy.. We all are bullyish in nature and we don't care about actual growth. We will make fun of your introvertedness and will laud extrovertedness of Modi even though he know shit. Though if you have said two words when the corruption was high in Congress, we wouldn't have given or even consider BJP. bjp didn't came bcoz of mandir and cows, but it came bcoz of people being fedup with your untolerable silence towards the shameful corruption

You were too much introvert and the current one is too much extrovert. No balance in between Sadhus are becoming CMs. What do you expect? The comments as usual are cancer. The job market is so fucked already, can't imagine how much more worse it can get C'mon now , someone should come up with solutions! Amd BJP govt should fucking accept it and implement it ! Nirmala Sitharaman's response for any question about the economy is acting all haughty and telling the finance secretary to answer it Oh so now he talks! If this man would have been allowed to rule unhindered from the Gandhi duo he would have completely transformed the country. Man, I miss the golden era of booming growth of the 70s. Overall economy - worldwide, has slowed down. But don't let that stop you from selective blaming and faux outrage.",2019-09-01 13:30:00
Policy/Economy,Why is Indian Mentality the way it is?,18,e3hjca,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e3hjca/why_is_indian_mentality_the_way_it_is/,27,"Don't attack me please.Hear me out.I'm as proud of my country's plus points as I'm ashamed of it'a shortcomings.I share a lot of shortcomings too.But,why are/were we Indians so conservative and close minded in our thinking?And I'm saying this is general.Even in millenials,there is some unconscious part of us which is close minded in certain aspects.I'm not saying the other countries are perfect,but they(not all people) seem to have a more open minded view to people while we feel the need to comment on each person's lifestyle and pass judgements(A part of it is human nature,I agree) and go a step further and try to interfere in people's lives.When will this stop?When will people start becoming more accepting?

Also,why is India still a developing nation when our history is longer than say,the USA?(as far as my knowledge goes,which isn't much)

I'm just curious.I'm not trying to demean anyone or any culture.",CommonRash," >Also,why is India still a developing nation when our history is longer than say,the USA?(as far as my knowledge goes,which isn't much)

Did you miss 150 years of colonism which existed till 1947?

India, as an independent nation and a free economy has existed only for 70ish years. 

Our economic policies have also been flawed for a large party of our history. Idealism, corruption and incorrect policies had pretty much shackled the economy until 1990.

Despite liberalising the economy later, we still had massive growths from 1990s onwards (the quality of the growth is whole another matter) The mentality is bad. Agreed. 
Development of a country is based on industrialization, income per capita, GDP, literacy and other such aspects, not history. So even though we have  a richer history, we lack in every other aspect. This is an Asian problem not an ""Indian"" problem, this is because our opinions are heavily influenced by our parents and the older you become the more conservative you get so your children too are conservative. I think many people in india have this kind of ultra conservative mentality because of our education system, in short, it makes people rote learn rather teaching them to think critically.

Also, in india still has low literacy rate of about 74% as of 2011 census. In 2011 census population of India was 1.21 billion(121 crore), so we have about 300 million(30 crore) people who are illitrate in 2011, so the number illitrate people in india in 2011 is almost equal to the entire population of USA.

India still remains as developing country even after more than 70 years of independence can be blamed to bad govt policies, corruption, the mentality of people and the worst one being population explosion. 

To get an idea how insanely fast population of India increased : In 1951 census the population of India was 361 million(36.1 crore), in 1961, it was 439 million(43.9 crore), 1971 it was 548 million(54.8 crore), in 1981, it was 683 million(63.8 crore), in 1991 it was 846 million(84.6 crore), 2001, it was 1029 million(102.9 crore), in 2011, it was 1210 million(121 crore). Presently, 2019 it is about 1370 million(137 crore).

So since independence we have added about 1 billion people to this country. So we need a lot of resources just to sustain the existing population. Now to add insult to the injury, we also had, many bad govt policies, corrupt politicians, who only look for their personal gains, rather than focusing on the development of the nation. Not related to your questions, but add a space after a punctuation (period, comma). Its always Shashak  Sewak mentality still rampant in India . Judiciary , bureaucracy , defence , industry etc. ,everywhere you will find this culture . 

As long as we don't accept everybody equal , how can we expect our society to grow .",2019-11-30 01:13:20

	1.	Are NRC and CAA separate?

Yes. 

NRC is not a law, It is a process mandated by  the Indian Citizenship ( Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules 2003.
Source

But are they connected? 

YES.

Since any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law. In fact there is a clause in every Act specifying the same, in our case, Section 18 of the Indian Citizenship Act 1955.

Source

	2.	What is the CAA, how can it be misused?

(a) CAA and why it’s unconstitutional

The core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get Indian citizenship. The catch is that these immigrants can’t be Muslims.

Are there really ‘persecuted minorities’ that would benefit from this legislation?

Yes, 31,313 individuals to be precise.
This was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the Bill. The committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation. The Intelligence Bureau replied:


But by specifically excluding Muslims (and Jews), the Bill has raised justified concerns that the Modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law. 

This when Article 14 of India’s constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basis.

Why does this Act violate Article 14?

Article 14 is Equality of Law.

‘the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth’

The opposition MPs had pointed this out but Amit Shah insisted the exception to Article 14, “reasonable classification” when making laws. 

In simple words the State can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg; reservations for marginalised communities.

This matter of whether “reasonable classification” is justified is why the Act is being contended in the Courts and will be decided later.

(b) How can CAA be misused?

CAA can be amended only by parliamentary procedures. 

The government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.

However, religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the CAA, 2019. The bare act reads:

""Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;"" 



Religious persecution is actually mentioned under the Rules to the amended Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.



This is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.


*The above point will be important while explaining NRC.

3. What is the NRC?

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens. 

The Nationwide NRC is as a process already underway through the NPR, which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census.

(a) What is the NPR?

The NPR is a list of “usual residents of the country”. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, a “usual resident of the country” is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months, or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. 

Unlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.
 It is mandatory for every “usual resident of India” to register in the NPR.

The NPR will collect both demographic data and biometric data. There are 15 different categories of demographic data, ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation, that the RGI is supposed to collect in the NPR. 

For biometric data it will depend on Aadhaar, for which it will seek Aadhaar details of the residents. This will allow the Union government, for the first time, to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parents.

Apart from this, in a test run going on across the country, the RGI is seeking details of mobile number, Aadhaar, PAN card, Driving Licence, Voter ID card and passport (in case the resident is Indian). It is also working to update the Civil Registration System of birth and death certificates.

Even as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. With the recent introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill, in which the Centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such data.

(b) How is NPR linked to the NRC?

The legal framework for the National Population Register is grounded in the Citizenship Act, 1955. In 2003, the Act was amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government to introduce the category of an “illegal migrant”. To implement this amendment, a set of rules were issued. 

(The link to the rules is the same as 1. Are CAA and NRC different)

The rules read: “The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status”.

How would these registers of citizens be created? The rules explicitly spell it out: 

“The Local Register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the Population Register.”

When the Local Register is generated from the Population Register, a “verification process” would be carried out which would create the category of “doubtful citizenship”. 

The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

This Population Register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the National Population Register.

Link
 In a gazette notification issued on July 31, 2019, the Modi government passed an order to “prepare and update the Population Register” in every state other than Assam.

(c) Arguments against NRC.

	(i).	A botched exercise in Assam

The National Register of Citizens in Assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from Bangladesh after 1971. 

The updated NRC was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the NRC of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the state.

It was a botched exercise. There were many errors during the process.
Source

 In all, around 19 lakh people in Assam were excluded from the final register. 
Source

Soon, the BJP started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register, while around five lakh Bengali Hindus were excluded. In fact, even some people who had campaigned for the BJP found themselves excluded.

Source: BJP complaining about a botched NRC
Source: 5 lakh Bengali Hindus excluded in NRC
Source: BJP campaigners find themselves excluded

Anyone who is not able to prove citizenship under NRC is put in detention centres.
Reports of the violation of Human rights in these detention centres is alarming.

Source: A newborn died in a detention centre in Assam. Their mother was later found not to be a foreigner.


	(ii).	Loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship laws

There is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot NRC launched in Assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide Bill hasn’t been drafted.

But one thing we know for sure - every person resident in India will be required to prove their citizenship.

How does one prove their citizenship?

This is where matters get complex.

If we don’t consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide NRC, The current law for citizenship is as follows -


The Citizenship Act defines a citizen as:

Section 3:

Citizenship by birth —

(1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,—
(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;

(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;

(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where—
(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or
(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, 

shall be a citizen of India by birth.

Short of this is,

If you were born in India before 1987 but after 1950, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are Indian citizens, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 2003 and both your parents are Indian citizens or one of your parents is an Indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant, you are a citizen.

So if you were born before 1987, you’re an Indian citizen by birth.

If you’re born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are Indian citizens. (What about the orphans?)

How do you do it?

If you’re born before 1987, you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the NRC.

Assuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they weren’t educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents. This leaves a person in a state of handicap.


If you’re born after 1987, considering that  almost 44% of India’s population is under  24 years of age and a total 85% of the population is under 54 years of age, we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of India’s population.

You have to prove that at least one of your parents is an Indian citizen. So if you’re born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987. You’ll have to provide the necessary documents of YOUR PARENTS
to prove THEY’RE Indian citizens. Basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960’s.

Many news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and Aadhar cards shall suffice and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

Mere submitting of passports, birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship, this was ruled by Bombay high court in 2013.
Source

In conclusion,
67% of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census. This coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster.

	(iii).	Why NRC promotes inequality against the Muslims?

Imagine a scenario where a nationwide NPR is rolled out. The babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a “specified proforma” from the register. 


Now, a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the CAA. Do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths “shall not be treated as illegal migrants"". Muslims, however, will not have any such recourse. For that matter, even Jews won’t be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register. 

As a result, lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens again.

The tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another country.

To benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, 

and, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution. 

*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.

	(iv).	Economic cost

The Global economy is on a slowdown and India is no exception to it, I generally never attribute GDP numbers with a Government since the only active participation of a Government in a GDP is via public expenditure which is still crucial. However, when a Government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy, then fingers will be pointed.

This is the case with NRC.

 In Assam alone it cost 1220 crores - 1500 crores and ended up in a massive failure.
Source:
 
The national cost of implementing the NRC would run into lakhs of crores. With the Indian economy in its current situation, implementing NRC would surely leave a visible dent on the Indian economy. Especially when there is absence of any ROI (Return on Investment) from such a policy.

The estimated cost of this might be close to 2-3 lakh crores (unverified).

Source: This is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimated.

Say, it costs 3 lakh crores, it’s still just 1.57% of our last year’s GDP i.e. $2.72 Trillion.

However, just like Demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt. People will have to line up yet again at verification centres, for document verification, follow ups & enquiries. 

In Assam, the NRC updating started on July 30, 2018 and ended on August 31, 2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process, the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errors.
Source:

A nation-wide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerous.

Demonetisation caused the GDP growth to drop to 6.1%, though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised too.
Source:.

Over 1.5 million jobs were lost in Q3 of FY 2016-17 post implementation of demonetisation.
Source CMIE report.

The nation wide implementation of NRC will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost.

	(v).	Cost of Error

The NRC exercise would be highly prone to error—both Type I and Type II. 

Explanation:

Type I errors:  False positives 

Mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and erroneously giving them the benefit of Indian citizenship. 

Immigrants are usually a net economic benefit; so the costs of Type I errors are only confined to national security. 

These costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in India.


Type II errors: False negatives

These occur when those who qualify as Indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants. A nationwide NRC, if similar to the one in Assam, would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deported.

Type II errors are extremely costly. To minimize false negatives, the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable. 

Also, infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the NRC has to be exceptionally efficient. 

The Indian state usually fails on both counts. Given the CAB’s current religious exclusionary basis, Muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives, though all groups, including Hindus, are likely to be affected by errors.


There are three main issues to consider here. 


The first is the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. 

If, to avoid false positives, the government has a high level of scrutiny for NRC inclusion, all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar. In the process, some might be mistakenly excluded. 

On the other hand, if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions, then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks. 
The current CAB framework, combined with the NRC, is set up to minimize false positives, which will automatically increase false negatives.


The third issue is of the magnitude of error.

1) If Govt executes well with 5% error, 67.5 million people will be displaced (equalling displacement by WW II)

2) If it has Aadhaar error rate (8.8%) 120 million will be left out.

3) If it has 1% error, still 13.5 million Indians will be displaced (same as partition of India)

Both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordingly.

But we need to do more. While educating common folks on CAA/NRC is important, we need to talk a lot more about the excessive police action taken in Jamia, the internet shutdowns, imposition of sec 144, situation in Kashmir, Northeast, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka etc. 

Also let them know that these protests are the only way a common Indian can make this government answerable for demonetization, increasing unemployment, poverty & income inequality, falling GDP and economy, environmental issues, mob lynchings, women issues and any other problems they face.

It is very easy to defend CAA, there is a team of BJP IT Cell working overtime doing exactly that, making info-graphics, creating whatsapp forwards etc. Engage them with showing videos of police brutality, and these are their standard replies:

1. ""there are 2 sides of argument"": Accept it, and then let them know that we're the ones showing them the other side; TV news, whatsapp forwards isn't showing you the videos you're showing them. Ask them, if there are 2 sides of the argument, why is government instructing TV news channels not to air news about the protests. [The circular](https://twitter.com/ShashiTharoor/status/1208048457249722368)

2. ""protesters are instigating violent"": Tell them about the 25 civilian deaths reported so far, 0 police deaths. Obviously we're not wishing for police to die, but make them realize that a stone thrown by a protester needs a bandage, a bullet fired by the police needs a grave. 

3. ""protesters don't even know why they're protesting"": BJP IT cell is on overdrive producing these videos and sharing them on whatsapp. (I have no set reply to this, please suggest some)

4. ""why were there no protests for <insert any other problem>: Apologize for not standing up back then, and let them know that it is not you who controls these protests personally. 


We're against a regime which currently has unlimited money, resources and manpower, controls the police, judiciary, media and has majority of population still under their spell.

In this subsection you should mention the Assam exception as the rules are different for them. This is great work! Finally something objective and reliable! Hey.. I’m an Indian Muslim and the last 3 months in India have been a complete nightmare. I saw your post a while back and really appreciated the time you took to lay everything down with sources, easy to absorb. For a while I tried to get other people to read it too, but most people aren’t really readers, and not into politics either, especially if it doesn’t affect them directly. 

So it inspired me to create a YouTube video with sources, much like yours. I tried to keep it entertaining (without being inappropriate), and sprinkled it with pop culture memes and animations. So even if people weren’t politically inclined, they watched it. 

I couldn’t fit all your points into it, as it was too long. But I just wanted to extend my deepest gratitude for your post, as this is where the video really began.

### Tl;dr

Access to good quality internet has never been more important than right now. With most experts unanimous on the need for  social distancing and many workplaces putting into place work from home plans, voice and data connectivity become critical. To ensure that high quality bandwidth is available to all parts of India we have suggested specific steps to be taken by the Department of Telecom. 

### ""We the people..."", of the Internet

Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Union Government is taking various policy measures to safeguard the health and welfare of all Indians as per an advisory by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare titled, “*Advisory on Social Distancing Measure in view of spread of COVID-19 disease*” ([**link**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/SocialDistancingAdvisorybyMOHFW.pdf)). Point number 3 to this advisory recommends to, “*Encourage private sector organizations/employers to allow employees to work from home wherever feasible.*” A “work from home” measure is critical during this time to contain adverse economic impacts on individuals, companies and the entire Indian economy.

At the same time during this period many people are likely to undergo mental stress and will reach out to loved ones for comfort and support. Even for children, remote educational modes of learning will become vital at this time as schools are closed. Many such interests which require social distancing necessary to restrict the spread of Covid-19 are supported by the availability of telecom and data services. However, as is the case with such a measure we would like to highlight that there comes certain network capacity related risks which policymakers must respond to. 

A recent report in the New York Times, dated March 16, 2020 informs us that a work and learn from home set up, leads to considerable stress on underlying network infrastructure ([**link**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/technology/coronavirus-working-from-home-internet.html)). This is because last mile home service networks are designed to handle traffic patterns which are considerably different to enterprise grade internet broadband networks. Moreover, Wi-Fi based home internet systems have their own set of challenges in terms of reliability and quality of service. 

### We need to have a plan to support each other

We urge for crucial policy measures by putting forth a comprehensive plan in coordination with appropriate government departments and ministries. We specifically suggest the following:

1. **Periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure** **constraints:** There is an urgent need for the DOT and TRAI to conduct assessments in consultation with large telecom and internet service providers on the capacity to carry voice and internet traffic. Separately, there's a need for authorities to engage with representatives from internet users both enterprise facing stakeholders and consumer facing stakeholders in challenges they may face in continuing their day to day activities online. All of these actions must nonetheless, uphold the spirit of net neutrality and not lead to discriminatory treatment of internet traffic.
2. **Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies:** We recommend that a voluntary pledge may be encouraged by the Union Government in which telecom and internet service providers decide to not terminate services of any residential or small business users because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused specifically by COVID-19. 
3. **Ensure full and complete access at all times:** We urge that an advisory may be issued to all State Governments to halt any internet shutdowns or actions under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017 which are likely to increase hardship for people and organisations. This includes measures which slow down internet access speeds since that has the potential cripple economic activities.

We urge people from across the community (especially technical experts and small businesses) on if they have experienced any difficulties whilst accessing the internet, or using voice and video conferencing services. IFF will remain alert to the situation should it develop.

Looks like we will be back to the country placing their wishes before 33 million Gods and hoping for a miracle.

Already RBI is signalling about imminent 2nd wave of NPAs. OPEC had lowered the price of oil to beggar shale oil revolution. As shale company bankruptcies rise, OPEC might decide to raise oil price. That will make everybody shit their pants.

In a growing economy, where the size of the pie is increasing, a billion people ignore the daily slights and the frictions. I don't like to visualize the situation as the bubble bursts. > Dark clouds loom over the economy, but, ­paradoxically, this is a result not of any policy paralysis. Decision-making is speedy—perhaps too much so—but the hand on the wheel is unsteady. The absence of a competent manager of key economic policies sticks out as a sore thumb. The government betrays a flaky approach to economic policy and complete ignorance about macroeconomic levers. But no one dares to say so openly. 

In addition to the lack of expert economists at the helm of our economy, we have an extremely vindictive and malicious admin that does not hesitate to persecute and harass anyone who disagrees with them. 

Who will agree to work on those terms?

Policy/Economy,"How I see the Pulwama Attacks, Abridged",14,f3t8ip,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f3t8ip/how_i_see_the_pulwama_attacks_abridged/,4,"So an year ago, there was some intelligence input that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack. Naturally, they relayed the information over to our honourable Prime Minister the Great Narendra Modi. Now our beautiful Modi was so preoccupied with thinking out policies for the then Budget to boost our economy that he did not pay attention to it. Those stupid intelligence officers should have found a better time to inform our marvellous Modi, like, say, after February 14th.

Anyways, the CRPF men were planning to go to Srinagar from Jammu. Our fantastic Modi told them to take 78 vehicles so that the people would not miss the glory that is the Indian Army. Some fools raised possible security threat in going in a conspicuous 78 vehicle convoy. How dare they?! Shouldn't the people of India, especially those antinationalistic Kashmiris, see the glory of our Hindu nation?

Anyways, while they were moving, a car laden with explosives rammed into one of the vehicles, and the resulting blast killed 40 of our brave CRPF men. This act of terrorism irked our magnificient Modi, who meditated to let their souls rest in peace. During this meditation, Modi got a divine message. ""Those putrid Pakistanis committed this act. We must punish them."" Now this was divine, because even after a year, the NIA still has no clue where the bomb came from, while Modi understood it in a fraction of a second.

Anyways, our divine Modi swore revenge on the damned Pakistanis, and sent our brave Indian Army to Balakot to kill them. Our Indian Army dropped bombs there, killing several Pakistani terrorists. This was a very valiant move. I heard that a soldier was so brave that he gained the Vir Chakra for bravely getting his plane shot down and getting caught.

Anyways, the attack was a success. Exactly 420 terrorists died, including 256 antinational bacteria, 69 anti-Hindu fungi, 42 anti-Indian ferns, 31 anti-democratic trees, 13 Congress lizards, and 9 Muslim Crows. The satellite image in this [Reuters article](https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-india-kashmir-pakistan-airstrike-insi/satellite-images-show-madrasa-buildings-still-standing-at-scene-of-indian-bombing-idINKCN1QN02Z) should show all casualities. If you don't see all of them, including the bacteria, that means you're antinational. Get wrecked by NRC, you filthy Non-Bhakt.

Anyways, the intelligent people of India realised that our excellent Modi should rule India for decades to come. They saw that under our admirable Modi, we can regain the glory of our Vedic age, where there were satellites, where people used the internet, where people had nuke-laden arrows, where divine cows cure cancer, where women were trophies to be placed rightfully in kitchens, where we were proud of our caste system, where Dalits knew their place, where there were no Muslims and hence no terrorists, where kingship was hereditary; wait no, kingship can't be hereditary otherwise we'd be no different from those crazy Congressmen and even crazier Congresswomen, to say nothing of Congress-transgenders. So the Vedic age wasn't perfect, after all. Huh. You learn new things every day.

Anyways, this is my belief of what really happened in Pulwama. Hindustan zindabad.

Dorsey said “we have policies around violent extremist groups,” but did not give a straightforward answer to the question. Dorsey did not respond to two requests for comment sent via Twitter DM.

.....

>The argument that external experts made to Motherboard aligns with what the Twitter employee aired: Society as a whole uncontroversially and unequivocally demanded that Twitter take action against ISIS in the wake of beheading videos spreading far and wide on the platform. The automated approach that Twitter took to eradicating ISIS was successful: “I haven’t seen a legit ISIS supporter on Twitter who lasts longer than 15 seconds for two-and-a-half years,” Amarnath Amarasingam, an extremism researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told Motherboard in a phone call. Society and politicians were willing to accept that some accounts were mistakenly suspended by Twitter during that process (for example, accounts [belonging to the hacktivist group Anonymous](https://www.theepochtimes.com/hackers-say-twitter-isnt-telling-the-whole-story-about-anti-terror-fight_1983519.html) that were reporting ISIS accounts to Twitter as part of an operation called #OpISIS were themselves banned).

Twitter's inaction on these accounts makes me more worried. Twitter is excessively used to promote nazi like ideology here in India. Many of these campaigns are paid and Twitter is also a beneficiary of these campaigns.

Policy/Economy,Quick Explainer on how to actually read and understand the Budget and Economic Survey,11,ex24ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ex24ov/quick_explainer_on_how_to_actually_read_and/,8,"Before the deluge of talking heads and op-eds overwhelm you with their thoughts, here's a rough guide to independently understand 
what the budget and Economic Survey are saying. Source: am research scholar in Economics. 

1. Listen to the whole budget speech or read the transcript online (usually available on a ministry website after a few hours). Dealing directly with the budget speech is the best way not to be swayed by random claims.

2. Filter through the hawa-baazi. A good chunk of the budget speech will be dedicated to singing the government's praises. Ignore all of that; the budget is as much a political speech as it is an economic one.  Do make a note of what they claim to have done though, in order to cross-check later. 

3. Most crucially, listen to how they intend to fund any new schemes. Are they going to increase taxes? Will they just give out loans via PSBs? Do they hope to draw on CSR resources? Will they divert funds from existing schemes?  There are typically two parts to the budget speech: Part A and Part B. Part A is mostly what they intend to do, Part B is mostly about how they intend to raise the funds for it; i.e. the taxation tweaks. Part B in my opinion is more important, as the how of these schemes is as important as the why. 

4. Listen to multiple commentary sources. Big business interests will obviously praise any budget that makes their life easier, and will also obviously praise the government in general to facilitate easy business. Thus: question anything that they say without highlighting specific plus points. The same applies to government critics, professors etc: They (myself included) have biases that lend themselves to automatically assuming the worst of any decision made. 

5. Don't overhype the budget. Between data manipulation and upcoming elections, the budget is no longer the significant economic blueprint that it once was. The same applies to the Economic Survey. It is important, but no longer sufficient to gauge the direction of the economy and the government's economic policies.",Crantankerous, To get the best picture of the Economic Survey and The Budget search for them on YouTube in context of UPSC Civil Services preparations.

Policy/Economy,Essential features of a rights respecting Data Protection Law,20,faprl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/faprl4/essential_features_of_a_rights_respecting_data/,0,"https://preview.redd.it/w3igtx7vnlj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d61bc619966e39747319b263d1e649d649382a

**Tl;dr**

IFF has responded to the call for public comments and suggestions by the Joint Committee on the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019 and sent across a submission on behalf of the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the Bill. We have also appended a public brief containing a high-level clause by clause analysis of the Bill. Additionally, we have appended two issue specific briefs on (a) workplace surveillance and (b) the relationship between the PDP Bill and the National Population Register.   


**Essential First Principles**

As a first step we apprised the Committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the Supreme Court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed. In this regard, we also mentioned that the Supreme Court in the right to privacy judgement (*KS Puttaswamy v Union of India*) made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well. In this regard, we highlighted that a lot of users’ experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public/semi-public in nature. Therefore, India’s data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains  


In addition, we noted that the Joint Committee could shape India’s data protection law to incorporate the [**seven privacy principles**](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles) of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which was developed by the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. These principles are based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and global examples like the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation. The seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy. They also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority; and for surveillance reform.   


**Major Concerns that should be addressed by the Committee**

Subsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the PDP Bill. This includes but is not limited to themes such as:  


*1.    Inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the Bill*

The Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people's government issued identity documents. This can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. **We therefore ask the Committee to remove this provision from the PDP Bill**.  


*2.*   *Need for a chapter on surveillance reform*

Presently, India does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government. The frameworks currently in place (under India’s Information Technology Act and the Telegraph Act) are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy. In particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight. **Thus, we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the Bill along the lines of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018**.  


*3.*   *Exceptions for central government to access non-personal data*

A provision in the PDP Bill (Clause 91) provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymised or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. Such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource. **We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data**.  


*4.   Issues with proposed structure of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the accompanying appellate structure*

* The selection committee consists of secretary-level officials. Two issues that arise here are of: i) accountability (these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members), and ii) diversity (it doesn’t reflect executive, judicial and external expertise). **Thus, we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation**.
* We have noted that the Bill **impairs the independence of the DPA** by allowing the Government to frame policies which will be binding on them.
* To ensure quicker and localised decision making, we have proposed having **state and regional DPA benches**.
* We think that as things stand, the Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency. To that end, we have **proposed that it must publish all its decisions**.   


*5.*   *The “reasonable purposes” exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under Clause 14 of the Bill.*

The exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide. It classifies publicly available personal data as under the “**reasonable purposes**” category. We think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic/individual sentiments on issues. We also think this would allow the government (and other powerful data fiduciaries) to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent. The right to privacy is applicable in public spaces. Therefore, we proposed that this **provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on people’s privacy in public spaces**.  


In addition to these themes, there are also other major issues with the Bill that we have discussed at length in our submission. The #SaveOurPrivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the PDP Bill. We are sharing them with the JPC, the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes.

Policy/Economy,"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!",61,ee6xey,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee6xey/antinational_who_me_antihindunational_certainly/,28,"**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

&#x200B;

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about “escalatory matrix”. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.

*Ahimsa* is the word I believe.",wricker," I really really appreciate what you had to say. We are screwed on so many fronts that I honestly believe CAA js a good facade for the government to keep people engaged. Good news is that people are coming out in large numbers. 
The anti-muslim, anti-dalit anti-anything that isn't savarna Hindu (that too a very very specific type) policy is dangerous and the govt will unfortunately carry it out via the front or the back door.
I have also learnt a good lesson now- no party should get absolute power. The federal structure of government was designed by our founding fathers for a very sound reason. This is beautifully written. Can't disagree with any of it. Do you believe all of this will end in a remotely democratic manner? As in bjp's removal through elections? Or is it likely all bloodbath and genocide from here on culminating in civil wars and perhaps even foreign interference. As much as I agree with the spirit of this post, I completely disagree with the substance - or rather, your interpretation of India.

This isn't about _ghar wapsi_ or about Modi or, indeed, the BJP (scum though they are). This is about the creation of India as a political entity since before 1947. You see, it's this bit:

> And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution.

Can the bhakts say so?


The Constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid. Pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty, they derive sovereignty from the people. The people have chosen to reject the constitution, because here's the kicker - the constitution and India are, and have always been, an inherently instable construct. The ideas of a secular India has always been deeply antithetical precisely because India is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation. India is a hastily cobbled-together post-colonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy - first the British Empire (justifiably so) and then Pakistan (unjustifiable) and Bangladesh (horrendously cruel).

It is these chickens that are, today, coming home to roost, because India's latent Hindutva was incredible easy to exploit. It always existed, it just lacked someone to point it out. And now that people are told that their Hindutva is threatened, the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing, and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their Hindu project safe.

India should never happened - the country was a post-colonial error, Britain's final kick to south Asia, and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake. Secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities, like European nations, or Indian states. India was always Hindutva, and Hindutva was always India - all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed, because that hatred is what justifies India's existence.

Tear the Republic down and demand statehood for your state, which is currently subjugated by India and Indianness. Sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus, and India will never have consensus that isn't phony and manufactured. That is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined. The idea of a Nation is based on commonality of language&culture. We preach ""Unity in Diversity"" and at the same time we also preach others to be ""Indian First"". These 2 messages are contradictory, why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an ""Indian"" if being Indian is just embracing the diversity?   Therein lies the ***real*** problem, the so called National Politics is stuck in a time capsule of North Centric Post-Partition Hindu-Muslim conflict. There is no nuance or logic to this narrative, BJP considers Hindu Nation as a foregone conclusion based on Partition whereas the other side doesn't have any retort other than ""let's not be a Hindu Pakistan"".

Liberals have lost the ideological battle because they're living in their own little worlds where they imagine India to be something its not. Majority of Indians don't give a damn about Progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards Charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes. What is the alternative to Modi? RAGA? Secularism is a noble State policy but it cannot be the only basis for a Nation. The ONLY ideological challenge Hindutva currently faces is Nativism from states such as Tamil Nadu&Bengal. Assamese opposition to CAB is also the same phenomenon, Assamese speakers have fallen below 50% in their own state and they don't want to fall any lower than that. 

>Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution

Liberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of Hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the GOOD aspects of Hinduism to create a positive liberal Hindu identity. BJP has exploited this Hindu Identity vacuum by claiming that they understand&respect the good aspects of Hinduism,  people who would've sided with Liberals now side with BJP because they ""respect"" Hinduism, however superficial it may be. You should read [this article](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/jyzFxtxjd2iGQPqA3mgOfN/Narendra-Modi-and-the-mystery-of-the-Hindu-Left.html) for more details. 

>Islamophobia

You're playing right into BJP's hands by using this term. BJP can&will use an UNO reverse card and label you as HinduPhobic.  **BottomLine:**You CANNOT defeat Hindu Identity politics by appealing to secularism&constitution ad nauseam.  You have to create a political Liberal Hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses. That is the only way i can see Hindutva going down. In summary:

1. BJP wants to change India into Hindu Rashtra
2. Muslims, Christians, Dalits and people who take the Constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that
3. Hence the BJP is hiding its intentions now; it has to change people's perceptions to normalize Hindutva even more than it is normalized currently
4. So how does it justify its fascism? By creating the conditions necessary for its justification
5. Muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as 'Pakistanis' or 'jihadis' who want India to become an Islamic state
6. Students will be seen as supporting Pakistan and jihadis, hence anti-nationals; they want to break India into pieces
7. Intellectuals are anti-nationals and urban Naxals, maybe even supporting China
8. Slurs such as these were merely slurs, not to be taken seriously, but now they'll become actual accusations (with perhaps legal, or extra-legal, consequences)
9. A conflict with Pakistan, or a very tangible fear of one, will help these slurs become real accusations
10. Thus BJP can justify further fascist policies like detention centres (which they deny now), and even unthinkable ones",2019-12-23 00:40:30
Policy/Economy,The problem with BJP supporters,71,ed1ehe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ed1ehe/the_problem_with_bjp_supporters/,16,"Okay, so this is my first ever post on reddit. I have been a keen observer of Indian politics since the last 6 years. I was a voter who voted for BJP in good faith thinking that they are different from other parties. But since the last few years my view point has completely changed. But this post won't discuss about the actions of BJP that led to the change in my political stance, but this would rather be a post about what is the real problem with the BJP supporters. 

I might be wrong here but here are some of my observations from my personal experience. 

1.) BJP fans simply don't understand that you can simultaneously oppose two political parties. As soon as you start debating them on a certain issue, they will straight away associate you with congress, communists or even with a terrorist. They believe that every one who is against BJP has joined a faction. 

2.) Staunch BJP fans certainly don't realize that a person isn't against the nation if they are against BJP.  They just rebrand you anti national even if you ask logical questions on government policies. These people are forgetting that we have every right to question the government and protest if we don't think something is right. That is what distinguishes us from a country like North Korea or Saudi Arabia. We do not have a king, rather we have a prime minister who is responsible for answering us. 

3.) BJP supporters tend to discredit each and every source which criticizes the government. These people are just not ready to accept the fact that someone who is not affiliated to any political party can criticize the government. If a post or a newspaper article condemns the government, they simply start calling it anti Indian or congress sponsored propaganda. 

4.) BJP supporters also use a tool called Whataboutism. They justify their wrongdoing by referring to the wrongdoing of other parties. For example, okay BJP is corrupt but what about congress it was more corrupt. But they do not understand that this does not change the fact that even BJP is corrupt, and if you are trying to bring positive changes you cannot repeat the same mistakes that your predecessors have made. 

5.) BJP supporters can't accept the fact that a person can do both constructive and destructive work. I agree that BJP has also brought in some positive changes, but that doesn't justify its wrongdoing. You can appreciate and criticize a person at the same time. Just because you have voted for them shouldn't make them immune to your criticism. You chose them to represent you, you have every right to criticize their actions and appreciate any good work. 

6.) Even if they can clearly see that BJP is playing communal politics, they will turn a blind eye to it. They say congress played a dirtier one, again whataboutism at its best. Congress played communal politics, that is the reason you voted against them. But if the new party also starts doing the same how can you support them only on the basis of your vote.  

7.) As soon as a communal card is played like mandir the BJP fans will always deviate from real issues like economy, poverty, economic reforms, business investments. Their first priority will become to resolve that petty issue rather than the real ones. 


So my thoughts on this issue is that in this day and age we are still fighting for the issues that the British wanted us to fight on. Religion, once upon a time it was used to unite people but right now it is only playing a divisive role. We as the modern generation have to stop taking pride in our religion and just not get emotional while voting on the basis of your religion. It does not matter whatever degree you have because if you caste your votes on the basis of just being from a particular religion then the value of getting that education goes to zero. Don't let social media dictate your perspective, do your own research and make your own mindset rather than following the mindset of the crowd. 

I would seriously like you guys to give your insight on this post. Thank you.",vardhan68," Every point is spot on! A physics prof from IIT Madras is my friend and we endlessly point out to him that anti bjp isn't pro congrss. I mean this is a guy who has learnt topology where a set that is not open need not be closed either. And still doesn't get this! They don't know what critical thinking is

Whatsapp University, Modia and IT Cell has brainwashed them BJP knows what racists Indians want to hear and spews that out over and over. that's why we call them Bhakts...for them opposing Bhand Janta Party is Blasphemy I agree with all these points. The saddest thing that has happened to me is I am no longer able to talk to my friends from highschool, we were friends since class 9th and since he supports Modi unconditionally he wouldn't even listen to me. So I hate this party and politics for this they have polarized us alot. The biggest problem I see is that they lie blatantly. It's so hard to have a good faith argument because they try to use every trick in the book except honesty. Very nicely said. Great job. 

By seeing all this text it is understood that you have done lot of debate and argument with people.

In a way u hv defended our great nation and tried to make it a better place. U defended it not at the border but from inside. So great job. I could agree more. I am so glad that people are starting to see the reality of things. 
Great job. Yea,and its absolutely right to call every bjp supporter (which far exceeds any other people) illiterate, bhakt and It cell if they support bjp and living yourself with pseudo superiority complex while thinking yourself as a 'intellectual' just because you don't support bjp, right?",2019-12-20 07:27:54
Policy/Economy,You. Yes!!! It's You. Do it.,67,ekjgwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ekjgwb/you_yes_its_you_do_it/,6,"It's high time already! It's so bad that a lurker has to post this. Have always been one, so as to never degrade the content quality of the sub. But, assessing the current political situation has made me impromptu promptly write this.
I'm not here to be a keyboard warrior by bashing the fascist leader and gain karma out of it.
Instead, I'll lay down a plan to tackle the current regime. It only deals with their propaganda power since it has time and again proven that propaganda plays a major role in convincing people to support or commit atrocities. This is the pillar that provides support to the oncoming fascism. Let's BREAK them into pieces. 

1) Since, lack of karma has refrained me from writing things in other subs. As a sound citizen, we need you to get our situation to be heard globally (like the HongKong protest). Henceforth, Fella redditors with high karma and eloquent writing skills. Do post articles, videos, engage in group discussions happening in global subs like world news, Politics and many more. Subs that has their presence in the front page.
Use your meme knowledge, post and repost memes to subs like memes, dank meme, meme economy and so on.

2) WhatsApp is the breeding ground for BJP propaganda. Inorder to counter this, we need you to post videos highlighting the hypocrisy of this party. Especially the ones that OFFICIAL PEEING HUMAN uploads. Tweet him asking for an offline download link of his vidoes. Or do download it by illegal means ( anything illegal for greater good is good).
Do not post link to the videos. Mid-life crisis unkills and aunties won't open the link and watch it. Even if they did, not gonna watch more than 5 seconds. They are brainwashed in thinking Modi is the superman that's gonna save their arse from monotonous life. Do not send them to a liberal's den. They identify themselves as Bhakt due to the sheer propaganda and will refute to believe any of it. Hence, remove the doctrine slowly. Administer the truth little by little in their silly heads. Truth is, if they can be brainwashed to an extend that can support this regime without giving any batshit about the trend of the country. They can be rewired to think in the right way as well. Sharing offline videos in WhatsApp groups will definitely make them watch it accidentally atleat once. Since, they are prone to clicking it on their Phone Gallery.  Apparently,most of them don't care to even delete it later.

You will obviously face criticism from your family, friends and acquaintances by sharing the videos in their WhatsApp Group. Calm your nerves down. Do not engage in a rebuttal with them. Keep posting every hour every day. Things will change. People who blindly supported the party's claims will progressively begin to think about it. They may not change their stand an overnight, a week, a month or forever. But will definitely cross think about the situation. And will not start shouting slogans praising this fascist regime.
Do add photos and videos highlighting great leaders,celebrities,experts of any field expressing their opinions. Do quote Golden words said by past leaders and dictators regarding the fascism.
Share pictures of scientific data and statistics highlighting the economic growth, unemployment     trend and so on. 

Might seem like a silly thing to do. But things like these are definitely the ones that pulled them in supporting BJP in the first place.

3) Eloquent writers of this sub. Please Write messages that serves like a WhatsApp forward messages. (You know, like the share with five groups to charge your smartphone to 100%)
Mods, please make an active thread on it. Allow us to copy and share it in the other online medias.
Use your wit and style, to enhance the power of the message. 

DO NOT LABEL an ignorant or a brainwashed mind as a bhakt or sanghi. I trusted Modi by the party's propaganda thinking they did good for the nation. Unlike the mainstream propaganda, I fell prey to the pretentious Quoran who bags the number one place in followers count. He sold lies without telling lies. He never lied about the policy and regulations government made. Instead, he bent and twisted the facts in favour of the party. He sold hopes after every failure of the government's action. He's a prime example of an educated moron. He highlights the fact that an educated mind is not equivalent as an intellect's mind.
Sorry it turned into a rant.
Wanted y'all to know,how a budding mind like mine fell to his black magic. His educational credentials is what makes growing and educated minds fall for such propaganda trap. If I hadn't stumbled upon this platform, I would've remained a Bhakth even now. 

Change starts from your home. Don't involve in a verbal abuse or quarrel with your hardcore right wing conservative family,if they are one. Instead, keep mumbling about the country's situation then and now like a casual talk.
Let their mind process it.
Educate them about history like How Hitler rose to power and how our country is trying to be the 1930's Germany.

Unlike the Nazi's  who had control over the media back then i.e the newspapers and Radio which was and is only one-sided where the true mind couldn't express the truth. Our generation is blessed enough to have countless online presence and mode of communication is much easier and two sided.

Brainwash the minds into thinking right.

Do not outcast them into a different sect. This will only create chaos. Their sadness will be disguised in the form anger. This will make them loathe our ideologies and ultimately send them into the deep pit of what propaganda machines dug.

Rather,listen to their side and make them understand. I don't know how many of the downvoted answers/ comments were genuinely by people who just needed to hear the other side of the story aka the true and filtered one.
If they are hell bent on being a bhakth,just ignore them. 

You know,brain is a fragile thing. It's shaped by the things that it's surround itself with.

4) Post Documentaries, articles, paragraphs from well renowned books about our world history or anything that seems relevant to the current cause

Fellow redditors be ready to smash the upvote buttons in sending them to the front page. 

It's far-off better than highlighting tweets or images that creates only segregation in the society.

Let's walk the path of Ahimsa and Truth.

""In a gentle way, you can shake the world.""
""Whenever you are confronted with an opponent, conquer him with love.""- M.K Gandhiji

""Peace  cannot be built on exclusivism, absolutism, and intolerance. But neither can it be built on vague liberal slogans and pious programs gestated in the smoke of confabulation. There can be no peace on earth without the kind of inner change that brings man back to his 'right mind'.""



LET'S DO IT. LET'S EDUCATE THEM.",agnjataupayoktavu," https://splinternews.com/we-asked-a-cult-deprogramming-expert-how-to-talk-your-f-1793857315 There is a certain group that will be beyond any understanding. Religion/Caste/Class are so ingrained deeply into Indian society that its incredibly difficult to escape from it. The only solution is to educate the kids properly so that they don’t take this horseshit over. Unfortunately in a tight family unit society its very difficult to do that. Please post memes about this on subreddits like r/memes or r/dankmemes so as to raise international awareness, like Hong Kong protesters. I agree with OP.

We must all do our part in this, no matter how small!",2020-01-06 05:41:39
Policy/Economy,Hear me out. This might be a rant. Maybe this government doesn't care about the people at all. Maybe we deserve this government as we did not vote them out in the last elections. Maybe this would be a lesson to future voters on whom not to vote.,20,ekxrig,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ekxrig/hear_me_out_this_might_be_a_rant_maybe_this/,10,"The way the leaders of this government are behaving, it is quite clear they have their heads buried so up in their own asses, they are totally oblivious of the ground realities. By the time people were yet to come out of Article 370 removal and Babri Masjid verdict, the government went ahead and implemented CAA. These guys are so good at creating new fires even before the embers of old flames have died down. They are not even giving time to the civil society to catch a breath.

Seriously attacking students and then condemning the attacks for namesake as if people wouldn't know who was behind these cowardly attacks. They have literally come to a conclusion that public is stupid, they will believe whatever our we spin it in the media. Gautam gambhir could have visited the university, hell nirmala sitharam is an Alumni of the same University. Is anyone even ready to take moral responsibility for these attacks?

I am pretty sure the party in power is almost ready to unleash their next half baked policy on our people and we will have to start protesting against that. Damn these are going to be 4 more very long years. By then the economy will be gone to dogs and if anybody questions anything there will always be the Pakistan rhetoric.",fekumama," Internet activism doesn't translate to real world.

We must discuss and reason with the people around us. I can't imagine what next 4 years have in store for us I noticed something odd during election times. Before the elections most of the popular porn sites were banned and only VPN accessible. Just right before are around that solider got released from Pakistan, all those popular porn sites were back to normal. No ban. Nothing. We have already accepted it was our mistake that we are in this position. We thought that the collective consciousness will trump all the bad and the evil mindset and take us forward. This can only go wrong if the collective believes religion is the way forward. Currently the protests are the form of the first draft answer to this long brewing fascism. And yes, if bjp rose to power, congress laid out the dais for its birth. We have to accept this fact, without acceptance we are not going to move forward. We need better alternatives. In this government, development comes with a cost(mostly secularism). Congress is shit. It's the best time for the rise of a new party and it is absolutely possible(eg AAP). Politicians should try to educated the people rather than trying to get people to act on emotion. No one can beat the bjp in using emotions to win elections, which is what all the parties are trying to do these days.",2020-01-07 02:08:24
Policy/Economy,"Hello Top Minds of R/india, Is the Indian economy being nokia-ed?",53,cz0ctb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cz0ctb/hello_top_minds_of_rindia_is_the_indian_economy/,43,"I am uncomfortable with the narrative that the bureaucrats and figureheads in the Indian government are clueless morons tanking our economy. Why can't it be the same thing Microsoft did to Nokia? Force a fire sale of Indian government assets. Maybe we are up for the biggest wealth transfer to the richest elite in this country since demonetization? Or am i wearing my tin foil hat a little too tight?

Edit: Spelling",H1ken," One of the biggest reasons for this slowdown is the death of private consumption. It was the only wheel that was sustaining the economy. Now with rural consumption taking a hit, the government is clueless. To revive demand it needs to pump that RBI surplus as development expenditure, but it risks increasing the inflation. With lower income rates and if inflation rises the government is on for a disaster.
Long story short, the government is walking on fire. Why not both? Their cluelessness contributed to the current slowdown, but they are also corrupt enough to use this opportunity to transfer Air India etc to Adani et al for cheap.

Also privatization does not have to be the government's brain child. It could simply be the government's friends seeing an opportunity and them 'convincing' the government. > Force a fire sale of Indian government assets.

This is a good rationale actually. Keep the tinfoil hat, we'll see more patterns like this. I am more interested in knowing what microsoft did to Nokia? It will happen. There are a lot of PSUs that the govt wants to rid of, but who will buy it when the buyers themselves are in a slump? 1) Global recession was long forecasted for 2020 
2) We failed to capitalise opportunity to get business from China 
3) Indian economy rested on what we call ""black money"" , addition of cluster mess which we call gst further compounded it, lack of government trust, and dynamic policies and if that was not enough the accumulation of money from middle class to elite few who won't invest leads to the perfect concoction to kick down our economy. Don't forget recession is part of economy cycle. 

Probable future :We should expect deflation of economy which will lead to lower product costs but also more job losses. 

Possible but unlikely: Govt may decrease interest rate in favor of inflation, now do remember most people use interest as investment option and they may get fked , but I don't see it increasing borrowings. New minted currencies + deflation + lower currency exchange value against usd may lead us down to Zimbabwe root Inviting the top minds of r/India? 246000 replies coming up Damn right!

We were once the 3310 of world economy...sigh! In a free economy, people have choice to use either cash or electronic/ banking medium. Cash has its own positives and cons. Once printed, it goes through thousands of extra transactions with no extra significant cost. However, the electronic transactions charge per transaction. Both the system should compete, and people can choose. Cash shouldn’t be a dirty word. It's hard to predict as this recession seems to be a cyclic one, it's not just India but globally the investment is slowing. There are many factors that can be attributed to current downturn and for every industry there's a different reason. What I believe is that India in actuality never recovered well from 2008, while in fiscal terms we were out of recession very quickly this was in parts fuelled by the excessive lending during 2009-12 from various public/private sector banks.

Till 2013 coupled with High Crude oil prices economy loomed, around 2014 crude oil prices decreased but the effects of NPA's started kicking in economy. During the same time many big loans started converted to NPA's and the every single month the NPA's ballooned. 

In between the Central Government's implementation of GST and Demonetisation fractured a lot of domestic consumption, as a lot of it depended on Black money ( This is my personal opinion ).  The current government failed to control the NPA's till Q1 FY’19 when there was reduction of stocks of NPA's  by \~Rs.21,000 Cr. 

The government now has started to refinance these banks and merge them, although merging shouldn't have been a priority, while it wasn't a bad step per say. The surplus that Government skimmed from RBI a part of it might be used for PSB Recapitalisation which seems to be a good step, again it's hard to predict anything when it comes to economy its a dynamic system of scale that no one can comprehend.

Rich will always get richer, there's no problem in that. I believe the important issue is for the countries large population ( India )  is to deliver jobs and grow middle class. With a lot of manufacturing automation / automation it would be hard to grow a middle class ( again this is an assumption ) . At this stage it's very difficult to predict to what extent automation is going to affect the job market. 

Now coming to selling assets , may be or may be not. There's no singular answer. 

I think governments montenisation plans on non-core assets is fine, if some business / riches can get even more rich through clever understanding of Indian bureaucracy it's still not a bad deal , not atleast for an average tax paying Indian middle class citizen,  we won't have to shell out money for operations of various CPSEs that are a burden on our pockets. The biggest concern is how this government has a socialistic attitude for the poor and a capitalistic outtake for ultra-rich. There is a very little concern for middle class, anyhow this is nothing new. 

We need to stop relying on Central / State governments, as for our business rather than expecting government to provide incentive for domestic business ( like China does ) , a lot of our business have to grow Global ambitions rather than fixating ourselves on Indian domestic market. I don't think the toxic mix of bureaucrats who are selected through UPSC with questionable hiring process and Politicians will be mature enough to understand the dynamic global market. While it's an extremely painstaking process but I do see a lot of business growing in core engineering services in India ( from mobile transceivers, SDR to Custom ASIC's ) who are actually making a lot of money. Leaving aside fancy AI / ML ( essentially decorated statisticians ).   
There are huge opportunities in global markets, only if we have vision and risk taking aptitude. Our economy is not just and shouldn't solely depend on a immature Government structure.

Policy/Economy,Blind boomer analogy in India - We are the real boomers,28,elxn3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/elxn3v/blind_boomer_analogy_in_india_we_are_the_real/,6,"With the ""OK Boomer"" memes becoming popular, I've noticed a lot of Indians blindly picking up American boomer arguments and using it in Indian context. The arguments go something to the tune of - you had the best of times, the best jobs, social security, economic growth and are now becoming an impediment to education subsidies and liberal policies that will benefit the present youth.

In the Indian context, these arguments are only partially true. Firstly, the word boomer refers to baby boomers generation born post WW-II (1946-1964). This was the period where the great health-care became accessible to everyone in developed nations and the child mortality dropped fast. However, the birth-rates remained relatively high (though decreasing) and this led to high number of kids being born. This was the golden period of American growth - women and boomers then joined labor force and there was a great productivity rise in labor. Middle-class grew and moved to sub-urbs and could live that idylic existence with benefits of big cities as well as countryside. Boomers led a positive existence - not just that, because the birth-rates decreased subsequently, boomers also had disproportionate power as a voting block (which was bolstered by the fact that the voting % in boomers is much higher than in subsequent generations too). So, they could bring about and keep laws which were in line with their values but were old-fashioned according to their successors. Moreover, older people living on savings hate increase in inflation that comes with debt-fueled government spendings. So, it was natural for this generation to be debt hawks which also meant opposition to subsidies which led to rise in education debt amongst younger generation.Hence, it is a legitimate cause of angst for politically savvy young people who are forced to live in a society controlled by the oldies who support arcane laws (against abortion for instance) and go against their benefits (education subsidies).

However, India has a completely different demographic profile. Purely, in terms of being the largest generation, we are the boomers of India. We were born around or just before the high growth post-liberalization India, have opportunities (in terms of private sector jobs, access to information) that the older generation did not have (boomers had booming economy whereas their parents had depression and war). Even as a political block, the young people have the biggest electoral power amongst all generations (a power that was partially harnessed by BJP when they won two elections). Moreover, with the dropping birth-rates in India, we would also grow old in an era of depressed population growth where we continue to be the most influential generation - just like the boomers!

However, it is also true that the older generation is more bigoted, religiously/caste-wise minded than us and have a role in morally bankrupt polity in this country. There is some blame that we can certainly lay on the older generation. But, the whole boomer spiel of the west wherein the millennial generation claims that the boomers had a much better life and are now actively spoiling the present and future of current youth is certainly not applicable here. Our parents' generation had a life of scarcity in terms of resources and opportunities. Even if you are not interested in reading history or talking to your parents, just watch movies - heroes or characters who were struggling to find work, were getting rejected because they could not pay bribes were part of every story. Apart from government jobs, any city apart from tier-I had little to no opportunities in the license-raj era. Statistically, there was lower economic growth and more poverty.

To see the claims about the older generation led a great life is ridiculous. However, it is true that the young need to break free of the religious and caste fundamentalism that the older generation were a victim of due to their lack of exposure and programming.",Monsultant," So I can say 'OK Boomer' to my casteist uncle?

Policy/Economy,Moderate rightists vs extremist Savarkarites,58,ecr1tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ecr1tb/moderate_rightists_vs_extremist_savarkarites/,12,"I'd identify myself as a centrist with a left inclination. I swing both directions on economic and social issues, but am strongly liberal and progressive on civil liberties. If someone labels me leftist, i would say - not entirely true, but sometimes I'm pretty leftist. With being labeled socialist, I would disagree more assertively, citing my strong inclinations towards a healthy mixed economy and market driven solutions to socio-economic problems. But if I was to be labeled Communist or Naxalite, I would vehemently disagree. I'm sure there are some overlaps between these ideologies and mine, but that way I'll have some overlaps with almost all ideologies in the world. So there's a spectrum on the left side of politics, which is well understood widely. Like me, most leftists don't identify with being communist or naxalite.

Now, right of centre politics, which is having a bit of a peak moment globally at the moment, is bound to have similar diversity and differentiation. But this differentiation is not as well understood, perhaps because Indian right has not been as dominant historically as it has been lately, so people haven't caught up yet. In case of the Modi-Shah government, a lot of people voted for them in the 2014 general elections because of the anti-corruption and development narrative they campaigned with, and because of the national security issue which peaked following Pulwama attack and Balakot airstrikes. These people may be supporters of market-driven economic reforms, may want a break from the status quo of structural corruption in the Indian state, may aspire towards a more assertive foreign policy and may desire a more proactive law and order regime. These are issues which many pragmatic liberals and leftists would also support. I, myself support many of this government's foreign, security and environmental policies. Can't say the same for this government's economic policies and civil liberties record. Anyone who doesn't see the plight of the Indian economy is delusional.

Coming back to the topic, most of the BJP voters may not support the RSS agenda or consider Modi an avatar of Vishnu. But nonetheless, in the everyday online discourse, anyone supporting Modi or government's policy is labeled as Modi-cultist (b word) or belonging to RSS (s word). These terms have been misused so much that they have become meaningless. (But at least  they are not as obscene as the terms that the right uses against left) This distinction between moderates and extremists on the right needs to be acknowledged and understood. The extremists on the Indian right subscribe to the Savarkarite ideology of radical majoritarian nationalism, which they try to link with Hinduism, by calling it Hindutva. The extremist Savarkarites are the ones who indulge in conspiracy theories of global islamic takeover, and that 'sab mile hue hain' - students, congress, aap, muslims, bollywood, global media (even Pak and Dawood). They act as if questioning our own government in a democracy is a crime. These Savarkarites are violently anti-Gandhian, so they are ready to justify any means, as long as the ends are as per their ideology. They are ok with democratic institutions being destroyed so that their leader wins,  hundreds dying because of demonetisation, regular Kashmiris suffering because of some extremist elements, innocent students being shot at because of vandalism done by others, and so on.

This extremist faction of the right is the real danger to our nation, and to whom most liberal leftists are strongly opposed. These Savarkarites interpret the BJP manadate to mean that majority of the country supports their extremists views of establishment of Hindu Rashtra, demonization of Muslims and one-party state in India. They forget that 65 % of Indians didn't vote for BJP, and even among the 35% that did,  many don't support their extremist agenda. These spontaneous, peaceful protests by lakhs of students in every single part of the country has proven that these Savarkarites are delusional. India is strongly pluralistic and will vehemently oppose the bigoted agenda that they subscribe to. And these lakhs of protestors are more opposed to violence than these extremist Savarkarites, and are heart-broken when some miscreants turn towards violence. Violent and extremist elements on both sides should be punished by the due process of law. Jai Hind!

P.S: Those who see the world only through one lens will wonder if I'm a muslim. I was born a Hindu, but no longer identify with any religion. I'm a proud Indian though.",hsnaras," Someone give this man a silver right fucking now! You're just clumping all right wing ideology together and calling these people ""Sarvarkarites"", which is misleading at best.

If you read Savarkar's writings, he never conflated Hinduism with Hindutva as you are trying to imply. Savarkar was actually pretty clear that religion had nothing to do with Hindutva. What he described as hindutva was a 'homogenous cultural identity of the subcontinent' according to him, which excluded the practices and traditions of Abrahamic religions because he believed those were foreign influences.

This is significantly different than the RSS, which is a primarily Brahmin Hindu organisation which believes in intra Hindu fragmentation as well, in other words, they do believe in castiest principles.

Things that you see nowadays such as all the Cow worship and beef ban, etc would not be a thing if people were following Savarkar.

Yes, both of these are far right ideological positions and I personally do not agree with any of them and think they are harmful to the country.

But **when you are talking about the ideological spectrum as you are in this post, you should recognise that the RSS ideology lies even further right to that of Savarkar.** Just take 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 Why don't you identify yourself with any religion now? The first paragraph is exactly how I'd describe myself too. Absolutely nailed it!",2019-12-19 17:42:38
Policy/Economy,Workplace Surveillance: Your employer could be watching you,29,f2mvuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2mvuh/workplace_surveillance_your_employer_could_be/,0,"###

### Tl;dr

IFF has prepared a public brief highlighting the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. Technologies like CCTV cameras, location tracking and device monitoring have made it possible for employers to turn workplaces into a panopticon, and such pervasive surveillance undermines the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. We encourage you to read the brief and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to ensure existing power imbalances between workers and employers are not exacerbated by the Bill.

### Your boss shouldn't be Big Boss

Much has been written about the exemptions provided under the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 for governmental surveillance but there is another form of surveillance which the Bill permits that we should all be worried about. Clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from seeking consent prior to processing personal data of their employees for recruitment and termination of employment, provision of services and benefits, verification of attendance and performance assessment. With advancement in technology, employers now have the ability to continuously monitor the real time activity of their employees through CCTV cameras, location tracking, device monitoring etc. By allowing employers to track bathroom breaks, lunch breaks and meetings of employees, such technologies pose a threat to the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. 

### Recommendations 

In order to ensure that any workplace surveillance is strictly need based, context specific and minimize intrusion into the personal lives of employees, we recommend that the following changes are made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019.

1. The principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
2. A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
3. The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill 2019.
4. The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionisation related activity and prescribe penalties for the same.
5. Trade Union affiliation should be categorised as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill 2019.

### Read the public brief and engage with the JPC

For more information, we encourge you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. The brief highlights the impact of workplace surveillance on the fundamental right to unionise guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) and the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It further explains existing provisions relating to workplace surveillance under the Bill and discusses their pros and cons. Following from the earlier discussion, the brief finally recommends five changes to the Bill to ensure that the existing power imbalances between employers and employees are not exacerbated by pervasive workplace surveillance.

If you are a trade union or employee association which needs more information about the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, please feel free to reach out to us at policy@internetfreedom.in. We encourage people to share this brief widely in their circles and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill.

Policy/Economy,I transcribed the full text of Dr. Manmohan Singh's remarks on economic mismanagement by the current government in India,729,czvagp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czvagp/i_transcribed_the_full_text_of_dr_manmohan_singhs/,162,"*Transcript of the remarks by India’s former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, about economic mismanagement under the Modi government. Sept 1 2019.*

The state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter’s GDP growth rate of 5 percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate, but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slowdown.

It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector’s growth is tottering at 0.6 percent. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. Domestic demand is depressed. And consumption growth is at an 18 month low. Nominal GDP growth is at 15 year low.

There is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded, and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiment are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recovery.

The Modi government’s policies are resulted in massive jobless growth. More than 3.5 lakh Jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting our most vulnerable workers.

Rural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India’s population.

Institutions are under attack, and their autonomy is being eroded. The resilience of the Reserve Bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees 1.76 lakh crore to the government, which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall. In addition, the credibility of India’s data has come under question under this government.

Budget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government.

Our youth, our farmers and our farm workers, entrepreneurs, and the marginalised section deserve better. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the Government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.",firasd," What's particularly angering to me is that the BJP listened to all this and then came out and made a completely unrelated and irrelevant attack on Dr. MMS by calling him a puppet of the Congress leadership.

Whether or not he was, I fail to understand how that is connected to the statement Dr. MMS had made on the economy.

And then they went ahead and said that the economy is working fine under the Modi government. I mean like wtf? Then why did the RBI transfer an unprecedented 1.76 lakh crore to the government? Why did the Fin Min rollback some of the budgetary provisions to implement new ones? Why is your NITI Aayog leadership and the economic advisors to the PM affirming that there indeed is a slowdown? Why are core sectors performing pathetically? Why are factories closing up?

Matlab, chutiya samaj rakha hai bas. Literally lying to our faces. At least acknowledge that there is a problem! Solving it comes later in the process. [deleted] > Rural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India’s population.

To me, this is the single biggest blunder The DeMo was big but one time blunder. Whereas, ignoring the farm crisis year on year is an even bigger blunder. You cannot say we have managed inflation by putting more than 50% of the population in severe debt and income crisis. That's not how you manage inflation. And that's exactly why this BJP govt has got the basics of economics wrong. And even now, I am afraid that all the subsidies are going to go to industries. Sure you can artificially increase the production and trade through govt intervention. But only for a limited period of time. Because who would consume what is produced when 50% of the population have had very poor income and are in debt. I really really hope that govt invests into the rural market. That is the need of the hour. But are they listening? MMS uses long sentences and uses big words like  tax buoyancy & elusive, he needs to put out statement in ELI5 format for folks in BJP to understand.

(if you need a non-Reddit link of the text, check my profile)

Useful to share when someone says ""oh it's cyclical, the global economy is slowing down"", etc.

MMS says it's a man-made disaster and I agree... maybe the UPA wasn't perfect and benefited from lucky market cycles (like the pre-2010 real estate boom), but all we've had since 2014 is pointless marketing campaigns with no follow-through like 'Make in india', 'startup india', etc, then self-inflicted wounds like Demonetisation, hastily-implemented GST, and all sorts of random regulations and taxes, including extreme margins for the govt on fuel (and businesspeople reporting increased harassment.) This is a misery. However, I salute Modi Govt. to have steered Indians and kept them away from realising these problems by giving them some other bullshit motives to praise him... like a Hindu rashtra and ordering some airstrike. He totally distracted people and still has them distracted from growing problems of unemployment..which was already the most serious problem during his 1st term.

You have to admit, NaMo is an expert at marketing himself and still keeping himself in power using things against the people of India which they like the most. Even among these problems of lack of employment, the people of India too (maybe not those who come here on Reddit, but still a lot of them) prefer  achieving a hindu rashtra rather than bringing something home to feed their families. It's not just NaMo, it's also the people of India. NaMo is just using this gullible nature to his advantage. 

And his propoganda...ooh la la...mamma mia....xD...all this fooling around with Rahul Gandhi being an idiot..well...to be fair...both leaders have said terribly stupid things in the past...but nobody ridicules the NaMo but pounces on RaGa instantaneously. Like seriously..you think we don't notice that there is no connection in totally ripping apart RaGa's political image apart and nobody touching you. Wow! 

This brings me to that airstrike...there was some terrorist activity and whatever action was needed to be taken was taken. Would've been done regardless of who was in power. And anyway, the suggestion to conduct an airstrike would've been suggested by the Head of the IAF, CAS; PMO just gives a GO to any suggestion. It was obviously beneficial to him looking how overtly patriotic our idiotic citizens were becoming. Another cheap thrill Indians love: Insulting Pakistan in whatever way possible. As a result...Indians loved this activity and there goes NaMo again.

And as a matter of fact...he steers the crowd so well, that these very people who had a twinkle in their eyes at the thought of 'acche din' have forgotten that those 'acche din' never arrived. So fucking awesome that a leader can do this. Last I knew somebody being this influential was Adolf Hitler and this is not insulting Modi. Maybe Forbes also named him one of the top most influential leaders of the world....but they don't know what kind of influence. 

You should try triggering people sentimentally by saying something mildly anti Modi on a primitive social platform like Facebook or Whatsapp...(some platform where a majority of this hindu-rashtra loving population is). The kind of blind love for NaMo and the immediate labelling of anti-national, endless hate, life threats, rape threats and whatnot: This is where you see the true India..the India that voted BJP in power.

In such a scenario, where the government and the citizens focus more on religion than actual livelihood of themselves, the people who want a better life are just stuck here. Best solution according to me is to escape this country ASAP and settle at place where your livelihood is not affected and you're away from religious wars and petty politics. Places like this exist, trust me. You just cannot thrive in India and cultivate a good ambitious career here. 

Maybe there will come a time where India will plunge so deep down this shithole that it'll have to press a hard reset over everything and start afresh. Maybe some day then it'll have a better and educated leader who'll actually take the reigns of this actually glorious country and restore it. Maybe maybe maybe. But this plunging and this reset is far from near....not happening 1-2  generations away from me since the current and all future contingents for this leadership are fucked up people. It'll take some more years to bring this country down just by virtue of it's volume. Since it is so slow, nobody is noticing... that's it.

This may be sounding a bit anti-nationalistic but I really think this is where the country is leading and there's no way leaders are mending their ways in the near future to steer away from this mess...they only know how to steer away from reality. Am I the only one who read it in his voice? He has ignored the fact that Hindu khatre me hai /s Legend When the country's majority is high AF on their drug of choice aka 'Hindutva', such important words of wisdom mean nothing. 

Farmers may be distressed now. The middle class may be bearing the brunt of Modinomics now. SMEs may be feeling the pinch now. 

But come elections, a military op against Pakistan or a perfectly timed resurgence of the Ram Mandir issue in the media or something equally manipulative would immediately turn these same now badly off, economically screwed dildos into loyal bhakts and they'll end up voting for the very same government which annihilated their happiness. *Again*. 

That's how powerful this drug is. Equally destructive is the epidemic caused by it. 

This drug, and those selling it, need to go for this self-inflicted fog of disorientation, chaos and self-destruction to lift. Actually, couldn’t agree more. Clearly the government is doing something wrong and it has to revisit its policies without appearing indecisive. and why have they increased the road penalties so much? Single biggest mistake of Indians was to elect NARENDRA modi as Prime Minister. As much as I like Dr. Manmohan Singh, it was criminal of UPA II to not impose GST under his watchful eyes. BJP and economics. Well, then why did they give Amartya Sen a Nobel prize for that? Any folks here in Economics and Finance care to elucidate on the situation - both for BJP and what our former PM is saying? O bhai! Yeh saari chize toh sanjay rajoura bhi bata deta. Koi solution bhi toh sunao manmohan sahib. There will be recession every 10 years because of business cycle. Govt cannot do anything. It is actually harmful to interfere. Nothing but opportunistic statement from Manmohan. It’s ok just blame us Chinese, we can take the extra hate.

Jokes aside at least u guys don’t see 50% rise in food prices [removed] I bet none of the numb nuts in the govt can explain the terms Tax Buoyancy, Jobless Growth and Nominal GDP. I agree with everything he says here. But without taking sides or calling names, interviews like this have lacked something people like me want to actually see; a solution. Of course, the economy is in doldrums, but Dr. Singh needs to shed some light on what this Govt. *can* do to improve this state of affairs. Politics in our country has always been about pointing out where either of the two parties has f\*cked up, with none coming out of any discussion the wiser. I know there are irreconcilable differences between not just the party ideologies but also within the voter camps, but the economy, like a million other issues, plague our citizens irrespective of their political beliefs. Desh ko bacha lo Sardar Ji we are fucked Okay we know what the problem is, what should be done now? Not like the general elections are around the corner. It'd be really great if people like MMS would help with the solutions and help the nation from this economic catastropy despite being from the opposition party. Thank you so much. I'm writing a thesis and using this speech, so you saved me tons of time! Vice chairman of NITI aayog on economic slowdown:. 

>stress in the financial sector has led to a slowdown in the economy, the Niti Aayog vice-chairman said the entire episode started with indiscriminate lending during 2009-14 leading rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) post 2014.
Rising NPAs reduced the ability of banks to do fresh lending, he said, adding the space was occupied by the shadow banks with credit growth of 25%.
The non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) could not manage this high loan growth leading to defaults by some of the large entities triggering slowdown in the economy eventually.

>It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector’s growth is tottering at 0.6 percent.  

This too could have been caused because banks had to stay back from credit expansion due to prolonged NPA problem. What do you think India will become in ten years - a kleptocracy like Russia or authoritarian state like Turkey? I thought if the the massive social subsidies under the NDA government continued we would have turned like Brazil. In a way then, it is good that BJP continues to be in power. They will reap the evils of what they sowed in the last tenure Agree with the points discussed here. Lekin sabne vote to BJP Ko he Dia? Kyun Dia? If not BJP then who else? Kaun banega PM ?

Policy/Economy,The govt takes 1.75 lakh crore from the RBI and proceeds to give 1.45 lakh crore to large corporates.,209,d6xedi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d6xedi/the_govt_takes_175_lakh_crore_from_the_rbi_and/,170,"What bizzaro world are we in where this is something to be celebrated.

Do people not understand that the majority of these ""funds"" will be spent on stock buybacks and higher bonuses? There are clear and abundant examples of what happens around the world when corp tax rates are decreased without a simultaneous effort to tackle the underlying problems of a stuttering economy.

Basic economic policy will tell you that in economies with deman side issues, an income tax cut will have far better and far more extensive implications that a corp tax cut.

fucking idiots the bunch of them. And all you morons that celebrate this.",FlamingNostrils," **The ELI5 version for those who didn't understand OP**:

- Taxes are how government get the money to run itself. 
- When taxes are reduced, government revenue falls. 
- Modi *kaka* has reduced the taxes for his corporate buddies.
- The resulting [tax reduction (of around 27%)](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/corporate-tax-cuts-a-panic-reaction-to-tide-over-choppy-sensex-congress) means government will lose around 1.45 lakh crore in tax revenue.
- Now, remember that the government had forced RBI to give it 1.75 lakh crore to ""boost"" the economy""? 
- So effectively, government tax cut will cause a loss of 1.45 lakh crore, and RBI money will be used to make up for it.
- In effect, Modi *kaka* is using our money so that corporates can get richer and share their wealth with him so that he can continue to dress in style (through 15+ lakh suit boot ~~bribes~~ gifts) and ensure BJP remains the richest political party in India.

**OP's Analysis**:

- OP points out that businesses will just use the money from tax cut to shore up themselves (by buying their own stocks or giving bigger bonuses).
- OP points that the real problem currently is that people are not buying anything.
- Less demands mean business have to reduce production as people are buying less.
- Reducing production means some workers have less or no work to do.
- So businesses will reduce the work force.
- Some businesses will reduce salary of workforce.
- Net effect, there will be less and less money to buy things.
- Reduced demands means more business loss and job cuts.
- OP suggests an income tax rate cut would help with this.
- If people have more money in hand, they will invest and spend more.
- An income tax rate cut is one way to ensure salaried people have more money.

**ELI5 of ""trickle down economy"" concept** under which this big tax cut for corporate is defended:

- The ""trickle down"" economic ""theory"" claims that benefits to the wealthy trickle down to everyone else.
- These benefits are usually tax cuts on businesses, high-income earners, capital gains, and dividends.
- The theory says that only rich people can drive economic growth.
- So it proposes tax cuts only for the wealthy, and not a general tax cut for everyone.
- It also proposes that the cuts have to be big for it to work (based on [Laffer Curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp) theory).
- It promises that the wealthy will use the extra money from the tax cuts to invest more, and expand business.
- This in turn will create more jobs or better jobs (higher salary).
- Thus, new jobs or higher salary mean people will spend more money and thus boost the economy. 
- This was applied by Reagan and Bush in the USA.
- During both the Reagan and Bush era, the economy improved.
- But Reagan had also increased government spending.
- Bush had also lowered Federal Fund rates (so loans became cheaper).
- So critics do not accept that the ""trickle down"" tax cut theory helped the economy. 
- They point out that during both Reagan and Bush era, inequality between the wealthy and the poor increased.
- The top one-fifth of the rich increased their income by 80%!
- The top 1 percent tripled their income!
- So instead of trickling down, the wealthy just became wealthier. Privatisation of profit and socialisation of loss. Bhai, simple. Chutiya people deserve chutiyi goverment. Abhi aagey aagey dekho hota kya hai. Bas koi bhi sector main government kuch announcement karde, raato raat sab expert banjayenge aur kahenge how this is better for us. Eg:  Demo, GST, abhi economy.

Modiji/BJP tatti bhi laake denge toh log kahega wah ye toh Amrit hai. BJP is comparing this to 1991 economic reforms. We live in a time when subsidies and loan waiver to poor is considered ""freebies"" and doling out money to corporates is considered essential for boosting business. The underlying logics are just bizarre! Govt don't understand the meaning of ""Reserve"" in RBI. These (Govt) are the kind of people who would tell you they can't hear you because it's dark outside. Well OP, you don't really understand or have never run a business. See, we have 10 lakh people coming in the cities looking for jobs **every month**. This is from agricultural displacement + new entrants in the workforce.

We fill about \~5% of that.

Now, we are surrounded by countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Thailand and Malaysia. Each of them is growing YoY in **manufacturing** exports, women participation in workforce and GDP per capita **faster than India.**

Also, there is a unique situation in world trade where companies are looking to hedge their investments made in China due to a possible breakdown in trade relations with the US and China.

Any company who has to invest anywhere makes an excel sheet to check probable ROIs and compares it with their options. We had \~35% taxes while every single one of these countries had \~20-25%.

OP thinks because there is no demand for consumption, that's why there is a slowdown. **But how does demand arise?** Do you want the government to magically gift people money? People need to work to earn and save money. Money for a poor country like us comes in the form of wages and salaries from manufacturing. **They do not come through subsidies.** That road leads to Venezuela.

This move is not about bUyBAckS or dIViDEnds. They are still taxed (unfairly). **This move is about increasing the base.** 15% tax for new manufacturing units goes a long, long way. It has never been done in India before and it needs to be applauded. We don't even export as many clothes as fucking Bangaldesh. What the fuck are you talking about?

We are not rich. We are poor. We need capital. Lots of it. The **US has zero % capital gains tax for foreign investors.** This after being the largest GDP country in the world. Compare our attitude when Pranab Mukherjee made a retrospective amendment to tax one single company after losing a case in the highest court of the country. Lucid OP is lucid.

I disagree on reducing income tax as being workable in India however. Not enough people pay income tax or are eligible to do so. Doubt a reduction would make any difference since it would affect just a percentage of the middle class at this point. Most people earn below 2.5LPA.

The demand side issue at a larger level is not driven by taxation alone but (probably) low wages, too-many-bills, debt, stagnating rural income.

In my view, direct cash transfer using JAM should've been done. This ain't a bizzare world, it is just late stage capitalism Yeh govermint to tatti bhi Prasad samajh ke khilwaayegi. People's brains have been rotted inside out by the same brainworms that affect American conservatives. Even if you discount the clear chain of shitty budgeting between RBI and the tax cut, what reason could possibly drive salaried workers to cheer for corporate tax cuts? They would have to be insanely gullible or incredibly misinformed to believe the money's coming back to their pockets.

I'm going to sound like a tinfoil lunatic when I say this, but the sheer prevalence of the pro-capitalist pro-market narrative in India makes me think that thinktanks like ORF and Brookings are actively churning it out in ways that aren't quite visible to me (yet.) Is Modi our Reagan? Fuck. People are going to be unhappy regardless, so why give a fuck. Bhai, in simple words you are wrong in your understanding.

There are hundreds of up points of reducing corporate tax, at par with Asian countries. I'm celebrating it, but for a very different reason. 

As I understand it, it's not going to improve the government'*s* wealth. That's a good thing in my eyes, because lack of funds will keep a check on their madcap hindutva social misadventures like NRC. Was confused since a month wether it is a slowdown or a recession. The corporate tax cut just tilted it towards a recession. Time to cash out and run for the hills.... Hour will kaka get foreign funding for his party otherwise? Someone has to pay. >fucking idiots the bunch of them. And all you morons that celebrate this.

None bigger than you.

These tax cuts were promised for ages.
They will not only help ease the burden of the companies but they'll also aid demand owing to lower prices when the benefits are passed on.

Don't rant just for the sake it, nobody is giving the corporates any money, they are just paying less which is good because the consumer then will pay less. Don't forgot the $1 billion in aid to Russia. Corporate tax cuts are a necessary step to improve the economy, but it's not the only step. This is widely backed by evidence. I would like to believe evidence based policies rather than mindless opposition or support, whatever may be the party. This is from Kuvera's weekly email. 

Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman announced a $20 billion plan to reduce the effective corporate tax rate, including surcharges, to 25.17%. This move comes in addition to the RBI’s interest-rate reduction to stimulate economic growth. Ms Sitharaman said that the new corporate tax rates would be ""comparable with the lowest tax rates in the South Asian region and in South East Asia"". Further, she announced a tax rate of 15% for new manufacturing units in the country that start production before 2023.
 
In the aftermath of this announcement, the S&P BSE Sensex and the Nifty 50 both rose ~5.32%.

There is sufficient evidence that shows that lower corporate tax rates have a direct impact on growth. Prof Rebello of Kelloggs and Prof Jaimovich of the University of Zurich studied the corporate tax rates in the US since 1890 and its impact on growth. They conclude that cutting the corporate tax rate spurs growth if the current rate is exceptionally high, an assertion which is true for India. Prior to the tax rate reform, we had one of the highest corporate tax rates in Asia and also globally.  Ab India ko Amrika Banayenge. > fucking idiots the bunch of them. And all you morons that celebrate this.

Is your objective feel better about your superior understanding or raise awareness. Perhaps a more softer positive tone would ensure your message is better received and goes further.

To be fair not everyone understands economics. Took a bunch of economists to condense the whole macroeconomics to reduce it to this simple statement ""Basic economic policy will tell you that in economies with deman side issues, an income tax cut will have far better and far more extensive implications that a corp tax cut"" that you have written here as something very obvious

Honestly speaking fuck you. You're just a smug asshole who is angrily waving his fist at morons like us and feeling superior about your own understanding. It does not help anyone Source?

Sorry but development was on agenda in 2014, not in 2019. In first term BJP realized they can't deliver on growth and they can't manage economy. The only way to stay in power was communal hatred. The BJP supporters are very happy with what is happening right now. Just a thought.

NRC is fucked up and the CAA is going to help in the NRC process in the future. This is shady af. 

I get that.

But why the hatred for CAA alone? Shouldn't the hatred be Directed on the NRC-CAA?

CAA only focuses on the speeding up of citizenship for the minority refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan into India thereby making us a safe haven for the minorities from the above mentioned countries.

In the CAA, there is no provision for muslims. But in truth, why would there even be ""muslim refugees"" from these ""muslim dominated countries""? [removed]",2019-12-18 10:23:59

Policy/Economy,Is this the future?,23,edwj5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/edwj5r/is_this_the_future/,10," Sumit was adjusting his position in the bus, sweating in the heat. He saw his friend Shweta shift beside him. They were just returning from their official trip from Mumbai, back to Delhi. The bus had picked them up from the airport. 

Sumit was explaining to Shweta about how good the movie was. While he was explaining, he was simultaneously watching the road. He had a view of the road ahead. He spotted two SUVs parked across the road, as if to block it. He saw half a dozen people standing in front of it. His heart skipped a beat.

His body stiffened, and Shweta felt it. 

“What’s wrong?” she asked

“Nothing, just give me a minute” he said

He kept looking around and found a seat beside another girl in the back. He immediately got up.

“You should move there” he said, pointing at the empty seat.

“Okay, you’re just acting weird now. Why should I move?” she asked in a high pitch

“Don’t ask questions, please! Just go there!” he said as he grabbed her hand and almost forcefully lead her to the seat. He only had a moment to look at her face and he felt bad.

“Okay, I’ll explain everything later. Just don’t worry. Sit tight and you’ll be fine” he said

She pulled him back, standing midway between the seat they were sitting in and the seat he had chosen. They felt the bus slow down further, she had to hold on to the rails on the ceiling. 

“I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what’s going on!” she hissed

Sumit looked around, and while some were staring at what was soon appearing to be a mob blocking the road, some were staring at them. Sumit figured he still had some seconds before they got in. He grabbed her hand and took her to the seat they had been sitting in.

“We don’t have time. But this is the issue. I’m circumcised. They look like RSS mobs and they normally check the guys for this. If they see that you’re with me, they’ll assume you are a muslim too. I’ll manage, it’s okay” he whispered to her. 

Shweta took a few moments to register what she just heard, while she saw Sumit’s face turn scarlet. They were good friends, but this was a detail about that she didn’t know if she wanted to hear. 

“Shweta, just go!” he hissed, but at the same time wondering what she was thinking

“No, why should I leave you to fend for yourself? Please, I’ll tell them that you’re with me. That you’re my family. They--”

“No, they are going to check all the men anyway. There’s no point” he interrupted her.

They heard voices, and he forcefully grabbed her hand and took her to the other seat. He ran back to his, and Shweta could see his back was stiff. She was crying but realised that she couldn’t do anything at this point.

She saw two men barge inside the bus with wooden clubs and she could even see knife handles, from the knives tucked into their pants. One man was remarkably tall, with a thick beard and had a saffron towel around his neck. The other man was of average height and clean shaven. 

“If you cooperate, this will be over quickly and you can be on your way. I’m saying it now, don’t create trouble” the smaller of the two men announced.

“All the men come outside!” the tall man roared, so loud that Shweta flinched

She knew what this was going to be. She felt a huge pang of guilt. Her instinct of self-preservation took over. “Nothing could be done” she thought. 

Five minutes later, she counted 18 men come back. They were one short.

She didn’t see Sumit come back. She felt the bus lurch forward and she immediately ran to the driver

“My friend isn’t back yet! Please! Don’t leave already, he must be out there!” she screamed

“He’s not coming back *beta*” he replied calmly

“No no! He will come back!” she screamed at the top of her voice in desperation

She then collapsed to the ground, next to the driver howling.

The year is 2038, in New Delhi, Hindustan. If you’re reading this from the past, you’ll notice that it’s not called India any more. It all started in 2016, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a huge mandate and were lauded for their pro-development policies. 

Before I tell you what happened, let me tell you what else is going on with “Hindustan”. What Sumit and Shweta went through is just one instance. This is happening everywhere. They can’t check women, but they check men if they’re circumcised. If they are, the women they are with are also taken. 

The government is condemning this, albeit very mildly and of course the PM keeps tweeting how sad he is and urges not to engage in violence. The government keeps insisting that they have no hand in this, but it is the work of “miscreants” that they aren’t able to control.

Starting with the protests that erupted in the erstwhile India at the end of 2019, it soon emerged that the BJP after winning their second election with a landslide, were now enacting their core ideologies. 

In Social Media, Narendra Modi always appeared to be a man who treated everyone equally. However, it was in rallies that his actual persona could be seen. Millions watched helplessly as he brainwashed thousands every week. The BJP realised that all they needed was to brainwash the gullible. To tell them that Hinduism was under threat. That our country was going to the Muslims. 

Muslims were accused so many things. The economy bad? They blamed it on them. They accused muslims of impersonating Hindus to get away and practice their religion secretly. This rumour became more widespread when Muslims were left stateless after the National Registry of Citizens was introduced in 2020. 

So many protested, but turns out they weren’t enough. Protests weren’t the only thing required. People needed to un-brainwashed. People needed a good pair of spectacles to see clearly. 

The hard truth was, the number of people who believed in “Hindutva” outnumbered the others and this kept BJP in power. The BJP knew - all they had to do was campaign in rural areas and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in India.

\---",LovableDistributor," Beautiful... if anyone thinks that this just a random art of fiction then just go back 20 years behind the time and tell people that 20 years from now there will be mob lynching on the basis of people seeing cow in a vehicle and the driver is lynched. Back then people would have laughed at this fiction but now we know its not  fiction anymore, same goes for the above post. No Modi in 2038 ?

Anyway, it could happen ! Holy shit. You had me in the first half. I was fuming and was fearful at the same time.

Not sure whether Modi would be around till 2038, let alone after 2024 (I see Shah being the PM candidate) but if we can't defeat them in 2024 election then yeah, I totally agree those days will come.

Edit: I hadn't read the title before and thought this incident actually happened. > all they had to do was campaign in** rural areas** and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in India.

Possibly yes.,6,417lmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/417lmk/are_investors_using_governments_fdi_policy_to/,1,"Bringing FDI is the new mantra for developing Indian economy so much so it is now considered only occupation worth pursuing for Indian PM and FM. Indian PM Modi makes a round trip of the world with impressive slogans and grants to bring much needed money  but little does he know or care at least till now that most of the money that do come to our country is the money that we couldn't collect in the first place. 

While FDI may not be such a bad thing in itself, one still needs to ask what these all FDIs coming to our country consist of and where exactly are they going.

>Answer: Black Money goes out of India for the reason of evasion of tax, however the money which flows out get’s negligible earnings on interest rates hence it flown back into India by various means to make an even bigger earning. **One of the important ways in which Black Money flows back in is the FDI route**.

>**Why would a country like Mauritius, which is primarily dependent on tourism and sugarcane able to contribute to about 40 percent of our FDI inflows?** Black money which flows out, goes into a Mauritian subsidiary of a Indian (any national) company and comes back into the stock market through FDI route. This is what is called as Round-tripping ie the whole conversion of Black Money into capital investments and returns.

Policy/Economy,The Purpose of War (1984) - George Orwell,36,ehjlce,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ehjlce/the_purpose_of_war_1984_george_orwell/,4,"The primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process — by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute — the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction — indeed, in some sense was the destruction — of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.

To return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals. Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare. The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built.

In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call ’the proles’. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.",Istradefylline," Everyone should read this. Just mesmerizing. I am speechless with the absolutely to the point logical flow of the events/causes. Never ever thought this. Never knew war had an economic purpose of social control.

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

Edit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!

Edit: If anyone needs help with any issues like job, education just message me. I would be happy to help.",ppcontentrobot," Awesome answer dude. You've put every point so precisely and there's no counter to any of that.

But, 'why would I come back to the place?' I'd give my answer to this. 

Because I am one of the few people who understand these issues.

Because I have power to solve one of these issues atleast to a tiny extent.

Because India sucking is as much a fault of the knowledged staying silent as that of the stupid ruling the roost.

(Bollywood answer alert!) Because it is my place! How many ever years I stay in any country, I wouldnt be considered as a localite. I wouldn't be able to say that this is my country. You said you are 28 and you have been in Germany for 8+ years, did you go there for your bachelors' degree? If yes, was the education free for bachelors'? 

Also, why doesn't Germany have a provision that parents of German(immigrant) citizens can also get German citizenship, like Canada?


Also, how is the treatment of Muslims in Germany, cause I heard the right wing is getting stronger there? Re Indian mangoes banned, it [was EU wide](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/fMXWwNQ0ZCL5ZjVAoGyhGI/EU-agrees-to-lift-import-ban-on-Alphonso-mangoes.html). There was also a ban on some vegetables which remained in place. Same reason: too much pesticide.

There have been similar alerts in [the UAE](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/uae-alert-over-pesticides-in-food-from-india-1.191984) and even the Indian press has [published stories](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/chemical-concoction-pesticides-in-veggies-and-fruits-harm-hyderabad-children/articleshow/65126763.cms) about it. Indians feel like people owe something to you. Indians take things personally. Like a comment here, a service would be considered as help and refused. When a service is refused - you know what it means. 

Fortunately, a service isn’t interpreted as help and thus not refused (as much as it is in India) abroad. I’ve noticed this and that’s just my two cents. The mentality of the people should change. Hyderabad doesn't have GEZ fee .... Germany has 😂😂 Nice post and agree with you. Currently living in South East Asia and I always want to move to Europe because of various reasons but the salaries and the taxes always make me think. Interesting read, OP.

I am curious, what is the status of racism against brown people in Germany considering the fact that there's been a sudden inflow in refugees over the past two years? 

Also, how long did it take you to get fluent in German? [deleted] Hi,
As someone living in Germany for quite some while and familiar other parts of Europe as well, which countries do you see having well established or a booming IT/tech industry at the moment/in the near future? 


Also, in terms of quality of life, ease of integration/emigration, and racial attitudes, and in general the culture how would you rank these countries?

Asking because I'm looking at emigrating to Europe as an option and would love to know your perspective. Ok, it seems like you're having a really good time in Germany and your quality of life is extremely well. I'm happy for you for that. You've risen out of the struggles of India and found some peace and breathing room in a more stable place. Good for you. I mean that.

Now, is it possible for you to return to Hyderabad permanently and still find a way to sustain yourself and those that depend on you financially? Considering you're a techie, there is a good (enough) market for software developers here so I think that is possible. If so, what is stopping you from doing that?

The reason I'm asking this is because you seem like an above average and sharp person. You've also had experience abroad which a lot of people do not have here. With all that in mind, your perspective and passion will be invaluable and the same goes for your siblings. If you're this passionate about your country while staying abroad, imagine what you could do for your country, your city or even just your locality if you were living here? So why aren't you here?

One reason could be that you really aren't financially stable enough to shift here, and that's ok. If that's not the case then the only reason left is that your passion is misplaced. You are only worrying about your ""home"" because you feel like you *should* or because you have family living there. When in reality you've subconsciously accepted your new home in Germany. It's either that or something else that explains why you're not in India trying to help with these problems you've mentioned.

See, all I'm hearing from your post is ""Please make the city more livable"". A plea coming from a non-resident Indian who will never go through the difficulties of achieving that goal (because he doesn't and won't live here) but expects the locals to do so. And inshallah we will do so, but not to set up cushions for you but to furnish our own cities.

Your post implies that us citizens are wilfully producing and promoting this black, ""shitty air"" that you mention when in fact, just in case you didn't know, we don't want this air just as much as you (actually, we don't want it more than you because we have to breathe it every day). This, if nothing else, keeps us motivated to change that and since we *are* living here we can directly try to change that.

So you can see why a rant about our ""shitty cities"" can sound hypocritical to our ears when we're trying to fix things here and someone who has just about none of a dog left in the race tells us to ""make the city more livable"". It sounds very condescending, like a rich merchant asking the poor peasants to ""hurry up and stop being poor"".

We're trying.

(And when I say ""you"" in this post I mean to point to every NRI that rants about the ""situation in India"" but hasn't contributed to anything significant to help with it.)

> do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope.

I don't know why I wrote all this. You've said it yourself; you only want the good parts without having to have worked to remove the bad parts.

---

Also, I don't know why you're worried about coming to Hyderabad as a Muslim. I'm not the most politically educated but even I can tell you that Hyderabad is possibly the safest place for an Indian Muslim to live in (particularly a Hyderabadi Muslim). If you don't believe that then either I'm wrong or you've just proven how out-of-touch you are with your culture.  [u/ppcontentrobot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ppcontentrobot/), I wouldn't disagree with anything. You are pitch perfect on what's wrong in the country and I wouldn't blame you for choosing a better quality of life.

I wish I could just raise a wand and change the way things work in our country but unfortunately I just can't. So, I came down here and asked the world what's wrong and how we can influence change? Jingle bells, I wasn't cut out for what came back.

**If there is one thing I am sure of, it is of the fact that we just can't keep doing this forever.** 

Things around emigration will change drastically in the next decade and it will no longer be cut out for everyone. I wish we don't have to wait till we get hit to reform change. But you will always be a foreigner there and never feel truly part of the country, despite having citizenship, not to mention the huge rise in anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe, which although brought about by mass immigration from Syria and Africa, will also threaten to sweep up well-educated foreigners like you.

The sad truth is India is destined for mediocrity, democracy is holding it back as it is susceptible to vote-bank  politics and nothing ever gets done.

China also has lots of different ethnic minorities (although not as many as India) and the reason they managed to do so well was because of an authoritarian leadership. 

India's inability to get a grip with the population explosion is contributing to much of this misery we will have the same population as China by 2024 despite only having 1/3 the land mass, we are extremely polluted due to this population density and it is said there will be a major water crisis in the future.

More than 50% of our population is in agriculture, this is completely unacceptable and farming should have been heavily mechanised by now and the people moved to manufacturing or something like that.



All this because crap politicians will keep their grip on power by gaining the votes of uneducated lower castes who can easily be convinced. The smart Indians will always view going abroad as the ultimate dream because they know India is beyond saving. It's easy to avoid dirt and walk away but it takes guts to step into the mess and clean it. But can you get chai from a tapari in Germany? 

From my experiences in Europe and Latin America, I prefer a life in India. Yes, it has its hassles, but everything is pretty accessible here, and affordable to everyone. I am not denying the downsides, but I would like to list out something that we want to overlook for greener pastures. 

* Nothing to boast, but I find the holiday structure of govt opportunities here pretty neat. And more public holidays. Private sector sucks, yes.

* I can travel 29 states, as diverse as Schengen nations. Just pack your bags and hop in a bus or train. You don't even need a car, even to go to the remotest part.

* No need for any language certificate to be anywhere or work anywhere, free movement.

* I don't know whether I would want to be another citizen

* I don't know about as many, but its pretty neat here too

* yup, no paternity leave here.

* exists here too

* Children can play with other children, and go to good schools as well. Might not be as extensive as there in curriculum, yes.

* I think you pay much more tax too, for social security, but way def a positive.

* Not great at infrastructure, but hospital and care are def good in my state.

The only place I felt like settling in was urban Brazil. Felt like a dev version of India with the most diverse and welcoming people I have ever met. Very interesting response.

Its your choice as to where you want to stay - Hyderabad versus Germany, but I want to ask:

1. What are the laws about spitting and littering in Germany? Did you educate your family and friends in Hyderabad about them?

2. Can you have religious functions in Germany shouting slogans in the street?

3. Can a mosque have loudspeakers blaring azaan 5 times a day? Can you set up a slaughterhouse on Eid and slaughter goats in the name of religion in Germany?

4. Can you stand and say ""I am an immigrant and a Muslim"" in Germany?

5. Did you know that the pollution you are complaing about comes from vehicles and people attempt to pay bribes to get PUC certificates? Try that in Germany too.

6. Can you get fake degrees in Germany like in Hyderabad? Can you come out after Friday prayers and pelt stones there? Can you tamper with your electric meter?

I have lived in Hyderabad and several cities in India. Yes, things are not hunky dory and perhaps lots of things can improve. Some of us are trying to improve, but you chose to leave and go away to Germany.

And that's fine. If you don't want to return to India in 6 to 8 years,  please don't. Just don't lecture us about how much Germany is better. Keep in mind that if the Far Right takes power in Germany, you'll be the first one demanding for a ticket on the flight back to Hyderabad. 

All of these luxurious things you mentioned are available in Germany because of under population and plentiful resources/jobs. That is how things were in most developed countries (US is a case in point) a generation ago. Once the population increases and competition for jobs intensifies, things will swing to the other extreme and quickly. Remember the country you are boasting about has a very bloody history of discrimination, and not too long ago either. Itna nafrat h toh yaha post kyyu karte ho? India should stop leaning into NRIs as Victims. Indians living in India are victims, Farmers, students, graduates, patients, average earning consumers. When will we stop catering towards whats happening to Brown looking people in America. 

I as an Indian living in India don't fucking care if you are fucked in USA. ""Dhobi ka kutta na Ghar ka na Ghat ka."" Your sorry ass will ignore this statement as well. So fuck you and your Anti India minds just to fill your purpose. Indians must and should never help you.

Our Indian Health care is fucked and has gone way down because Indian born Doctors in US study from India and performs a rectal exam of some white crack head hillbilly, just because his skin is White and beautiful. He never will chose to do the same for Indian sewer cleaner. The color makes a huge difference. Hence the health Care is worst and people in India die everyday unlike America. Cuz Indians are always there to cure White people in exchange of dollars.

Fuck your immigration issues. I'd rather have an hardworking illlegal Bangladeshi or Pakistani in India than discussing or worring about your sorry ass in USA or Germany for nothing.",2019-10-05 23:52:48

We move to countryside , same case, thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them, government schools that barely educate them, social welfare policies that are worth billions that won't even cover their most basic of the needs, huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as a home, billions in medicine that won't even help curing most common ailments. Enormous quantities of ration that isn't even the fraction of what is needed, all of that because they are born in the wrong place, to the wrong families, in the wrong castes etc.,

It just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done, the resources that could be utilized properly, i am extremely disheartened watching all this guys, very very disappointed!

Of such Inefficiency in exploitation!! I mean what the hell are we thinking?? Wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement! Like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something, or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it, maximizing enjoyment factor! All that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people, instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death, we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fist-full of food, but then kill them anyway! Instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently ""elevate"" these people, you know what we can do? GIANT MACHINES!! Machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix, we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass. We hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts!! Think about it, we can use this butt currency to improve our economy, place bets in the death matches etc!! Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months, imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that!! We.. We could be like a self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto! 

I mean seriously think about this, it is a much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now!!

Just my two cents!! Join me in supporting for a humane and prosperous India, lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy* by locking up the poor!


^^^*only ^^^poor ^^^illiterates ^^^count.",Rocky_since1951," Apparently, 30% of the population is below poverty line. That is they live by dollar a day. A lot of time we don't see them because we live in a bubble. Your security guards and waiters mostly come from Bihar and NE. And there are much lesser jobs our countrymen do. Its the middle class that is getting the D in india was that an attempt at mocking the underprivileged?  

>lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy\* by locking up the poor!  
>  
>\*only poor illiterates count. >Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months

Wrong fact.

Just get one thing straight, it doesn't matter however targeted programmes you run, there is only one way to remove poverty, that is is rapid economic growth. Rising tide lifts all boats. You may not want it but the country needs 10 more Mukesh Ambani’s so that they can employ millions and thus there is some hope for some people. Just see Chinese example, they didn't care about people opinions, they picked them from villages, provided them jobs, housing, medical and thus created chain of people coming out of abject poverty.

Though I am well aware this can't be implemented in India. [deleted] Hi,

So I feel the same way. You can't really change generations of class divide, however change yourself.

Treat everyone with respect. I say thank you and sorry to watchmen, chefs and Walters and try not to disturb them too much. Just be kind and understanding to all. Try not to dress too fancy all the time. Remember the zeros on the left side of your net worth matter alot, but after a while the zeros on the right and side matter less. 

Try to live a humble life. Never waste food or try to do so if possible. Try to use public transport and just be nice person who doesn't show off his or her money or parents money. Just don't give money in charity, but time also by volunteering for a cause you think you are good at. You don't know how many lives you cand drastically improve indirectly. I get confused with the term ""poor people"" offlate. At least, majority of those who qualify under the ""poor people"" category in cities don't really fall under this group as they earn really well, but in ""unaccountable ways"" aka without any taxation. How they spend their money is a different matter though. Most of these poor people earn a hand full in cities or don't earn because they are lazy (and not because of lack of opportunities). 

I feel every time I get exploited by these ""poor people"" rather than I exploiting them - it starts with almost everyone who fall into this BPL category and they will try to extract as much as possible from you or cheat you or want to get away with half baked work. Take your maid, auto driver, road sweeper, vegetable seller, construction worker, etc etc etc.. Just this evening, I am fooled with poor quality apples in spite of paying the amount he asked for it. 

PS: i am specifically referring to these fake poor people in cities and not the real poor, mostly outside big cities & towns, who struggle to meet ends inspite of hard work.",2019-11-29 15:03:07
Policy/Economy,I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,95,c95ykl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,46,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",MelodicBerries," Based on your summary, (and good of you to make the effort!) the economic survey is goobleydook. 

If they’re busy saying general equilibrium theory is Anglo Saxon economics (and somehow behavioral stuff is not?) then it’s some weird waste of time in the “you aren’t even wrong” kind of bad.

I’m going to go read it. Now one else has to waste their time on this shit. Literally /r/badeconomics. Thank you for your service to the nation. One of the worst economic survey's ever in the recent years. It was expected, given how the current CEA got his job,

Why demonetisation will be revolutionary in India’s fight against corruption"", and ""Demonetisation: Are the poor really suffering?"", respectively, Subramanian supported the Government of India's banknote demonetisation policy in 2016. What didn't catch your eye

1. Nudge economics and excessive stress on behavioural economics -> it seems like a kind of foreshadowing and a prelude to ""excuses for data theft""

2. After speaking few pages on gibberish on big data and data, the govt reiterates the same lines as it did before aadhar judgment. Sovereignty of data, state security and providing cheap data to corporates while again, using the garb of security and ease of biz

3. All the wanking on beti bachao beti padhao being an immense success and swacchh bharat being a great success. Sorry to let you know, the chapters seemed kind of promotion than anything related to policy prescription. That's quite a downgrade, even under NDAs standards, given I haven't missed an ES since 2014

4. For all the bashing of anglo saxon economics. Do yourself a favor. Pick up es 2018, book 1. See chapter 1 or chapter 2 (basically the big chapter). In one of the boxes, where it compares to USA and then later in another of the chapters, where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies, it shamelessly uses Rodriks theory and proves, India shouldn't give a Damn about savings rate. This time it did a 180. 😂 Bro thank you for the effort You missed out The Nudge. The mass control program. They are gonna make robots out of people. For the first time ever, a government has openly admitted to using behavioral control. Just imagine the consequences of it as used in electoral politics. Thank you! Can you please ELI5 general equilibrium theory? I am little concern about mutual alienation between india and russia and in return US's backstabbing. 

Theoretically US-China's trade war should benefit india, but by the way US has treated us in the previous term i am not sure. High quality stuff.. thanks! [deleted] So is this a major policy break then? Is India ditching free market economics for some sort of a social democracy (e.g., like the Nordic Model) or are we adapting the managed-economy model of China? Could someone explain exactly what Nudges the govt is implementing?

I've read the book called Nudge by Thaler. It could be a good thing if done right or it could be Orwellian if done wrong.",2019-07-05 02:29:05
Policy/Economy,"The true purpose of reservations in India is not economic upliftment, but social inclusion.",133,d6vb4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d6vb4b/the_true_purpose_of_reservations_in_india_is_not/,54," ***For the record, I am a Brahmin (I don't see myself as one. It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***

Reservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India's inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a ""*necessary evil*"" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.

Reservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.

The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.

Why am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. 

It is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice.",conqueror_of_destiny," Do you think it is working? What I see is that even otherwise reasonable people get angay and resentful when they talk about reservation. I personally know a few people who talks about sc/st people in extremely bad manner. They weren't like this before entrance examinations after 12th. Now, whenever we discuss about writing PSC examinations, they are like 'Enthina? Kanda polyadikku okke kittum. Nammalu ezhuthiyikk karyamilla' Meaning: For what? Only low caste people(expletive) will benefit from such examinations and we won't get any benefit.

Another thing I have noticed is that these same people are getting more crazy about religion, especially Hindus. They feel that there is no one else to support them. So, reservations don't reinforce already existing caste distinctions in Society? Economic based scholarships would go a long way in alleviating this rather than reservation in jobs.

Once you have education in your mind, you get a certain level of self-awareness and self-respect. > The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse.

They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.


Ok, I'm a dalit. I've trying to learn about the history of dalits for a long time. Although what you've written seems like the dominant narrative. I think the truth could be much more sinister. 

In TN, where I live, the Dalit communities in ancient times still lived outside these agricultural societies. But there are several cultural practices, that would turn the idea that dalits were looked down upon. Several rituals in marriages and temple functions etc have a respectable role for members of these castes and receive their blessings. Some temple festivals start with the first ritual being performed from by a member of pariayar community. Then there's that sangam poetry which puts the paraiyar community as one of the noble communities. So there is a lot we are missing here.

But looking at the recent Y-DNA results and the cultural practices of the past. It's possible there was a shift in religious practices that resulted in the dehumanization of dalits. Dalits are most likely the descendants of the tribals that lived in the periphery of the cities. They lived in separate settlements because they are culturally hunter-gatherers. And there definitely was some mixing in the absence of a caste system. And they lived peacefully becacuse the post IVC agricultural societies knew they are descended from hunter-gatherer societies themselves and had hunter-gatherer gods such as Sivan and Murugan. 

The shift is the Sanskritisation of Tamil culture with the arrival of more vedic-leaning brahmins. I think there were other brahmins before who had integrated with Tamil culture and were okay with adopting local traditions. This could be one of the cause for the schisms that exist between iyers and iyengars in TN.  The beginning of the caste system and sanskritization of TN culture would have pushed dalits outside Tamil society in a power struggle for the cultural space of the Tamils with the brahmins winning. Today there are still remnants of this struggle. Lot of old kula deivam temples employ dalits as the priests out of tradition. 

So yea, in the last 1500 years condition of dalits have deteriorated to that of slaves. It just wasn't always like that. I'm a Brahmin too and yes I am not against the reservation but against the efficiency of reservation, my family was extremely poor and my father used to pull rickshaw and worked in a Hotel ( Included cleaning Hotel's toilet about 10 years ago ).

while I've seen abject poverty and with a family of five hardly managing food. In Urban area's most of Upper caste are never different from any other poor, even back in our village the situations have changed with hardly any opportunity  left .There was no government scheme that would help us. That's not just us but most of the relatives back  in the rural area.

Before giving my AIEEE and making it to an NIT, I didn't hardly ate anything for 2 days but water.

I remember my first day of college, where my room mate whose father had association with BAMCEF and grilled me for 15 minutes, as if I was going to discriminate his son. Ultimately he became a good friend despite his father brainwashing him when we parted from the college, to an extent that he admitted and hated the reservation system himself. Through years, he came to know about the fact that poverty strikes both Dalits and Upper caste the same way atleast in Urban areas. Dalits in rural areas no doubt have it worse, and even in Urban areas there is discrimination but it's certainly decreasing. His father was a professor in known college of UP, and he had a relatively cushioned life. Right now there is a generation of Dalits which has reaped benefits of reservation and are not willing to leave the same for the needs of the others.

>Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India.

Do you think the current reservation system will ever take out these communities from poverty ? there are millions of Dalits in Rural areas who will remain where they are because group of  Elite Dalits of Urban areas will keep reaping the benefits in a cycle.

&#x200B;

>The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India.

If after 70 years of independence, if these efforts have ""hardly"" improved anything then don't you think there is something wrong with the reservation policies ?  By the current pace of improvements in life of Rural Dalits who are real victim, it's going to take 1000's of years. Back in the village a Dalit Family still faces a lot of discrimination, the situation in Urban areas have improved compared to that. The reservation should preferably be given Rural Dalits and then anyone else. I don't understand your blanket statement, a lot of communities within Dalits are now very rich and powerful, if we don't change the system this will be just another caste system.

&#x200B;

>Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded

I lost my mother to Cancer 6 years ago, a lot of poor people do. We didn't had money to get her treated in a good hospital. Certainly again government won't help us under NHP schemes the budget were allocated for SC/ST. Some of them being not utilised. We wrote to countless bureaucratic structure to help us, so that we could use the same under as we were economically poor but we couldn't. She died in extreme sufferings. Is this the social justice that you are talking about ?Reservation system in India is deeply flawed and it's time we start talking about it.

&#x200B;

You write very nice things, but I don't think you've seen the poverty as a upper class poor or even Dalit for that matter. Ask them and they would any day leave their caste / creed / religion and be whatever you ask them to be. /u/conqueror_of_destiny While I agree with most of your text, the aim of affirmative action is not social equality(inclusion) but equal representation. AA does not aim to remove discrimination, but to provide representation to those who have been historically oppressed.

Anti-discrimination laws exist to ensure social equality, while social schemes exist for economic equality. Paisa hai to status hai bhai. Agar paisa hai to untouchable also becomes a valued best friend you brag about Yeah. It's sad and funny that a lot of people nowadays think the main problem with caste system is reservation and the small minority that ""abuses"" it. i agree to you. but none of these reason justifies reservation to person who belongs to family of a civil servant, doctor, rich bushiness man, (economically strong) families. \>Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India.

&#x200B;

1. How do you measure social opportunity?
2. Do you believe OBC reservations  are a evil\\necessary evil or are they justice?
3. Why do you believe ""justice"" against those not guilty of discrimination is not evil? 
4. What social opportunities are available to a lower middle class Jat\\Kshatriya that are not available to a Sr level SC govt employees kid and how does an IIT reserved seat help the kid get those? Correct me if I’m wrong. But wasn’t the original purpose of reservation to uplift minorities in a certain amount of years and then remove it when equality( economically and socially) for all people is reached but then every politician decided to just use it for votes instead of actually uplifting the minorities. Truth is their are not much gov jobs compared to increasing population of India. Reservation in job doesn’t matter much.

secondly talking about merit based admission in colleges their are not much good quality of institute apart from IIMs and IITs and few other.  and IITs are also not that extraordinary. so pro-reservation lobby must understand that all students from sc/st/obc generally are less talented than 50% of the class. and it is very likely they will remain below avrg in their Batch. only top 5% or 10% are winners at the end of 3/4 years degree. 
and people against reservation complaining sc/st/obc stealing their seats they need to under that even reservation is removed u won’t amount much. 

I see whole reservation thing as dividing India more than actually helping SC/ST/OBC.  
their was a reason ambedkar did not want reservation forever.  

disclaimer: I am gujju bania who passed 12th science on 6th attempt, never went to college, ran family bness and now am mining bitcoin at Iceland. I don’t complain about anything and I get what I want. Thank you for writing this. Also want to add how oblivious most of us are about the casual discrimination that happens around us. It's almost embedded in our culture. 

I recently went home and heard two phrases (that I had been hearing forever), but their connotation dawned on me just recently. Basically they were like ""what you acting like an xyz caste"" (meaning - you are being dirty or messy like a person from the said caste"". Second was like ""you are looking like an xyz"" (meaning you are looking dirty and unkempt, again like a person from the said caste). Needless to say the said caste fall under SC. 

These are phrases very commonly used (at least in my hometown). The person using this isn't really a bad/mean/casteist person. It was just so integrated in the whole culture that even though the phrases are outright derogatory, they are just normalised. The discrimination is just so normalised. Why not both? we want reservations for poor Dalits. Look up Nietzsche's notions of master and slave morality and the concept of *ressentiment*. Perfect comment man (or woman). It's a shame that so few of the anti reservation people even know of the fact that it's not meant to be a poverty alleviation scheme. It was always about social inclusion and for all its faults, real or perceived, it has performed decently at this. 

There's a reasonable case to be made for more subdivisions in the quotas though. There is class within caste as well for eg the Meena Caste is more educated and powerful than the other SC castes. Most of the benefits are cornered by them leaving the other people in the same state they were in before. Such type of reforms and A Creamy layer exclusion can be thought of. The creamy layer will not be based on the logic that economic upliftment finishes social discrimination but on the logic that the benefits of reservation should percolate more freely among the deserving. Thank you, you have done a good job. But it's not easy for everyone to look at this in a non-emotional way or rational way, I kind of agree to the other side of the argument too, reservation does causes some more division and anger, being from a OBC and not using any kind of reservation till date.

But I'm more in support for reservations than against it. Agreed Some of the other developed/more sucessful countries that have reservation that I know of : China, USA, Japan. There are probably more. I belong to a lower middle class sc family. Two of my cousins who got high paying govt jobs, wanted to marry their respective gfs, both of whom was from higher castes. Both the girl's parents said the same thing, that their community wont accept them after they have married their girl to a boy from lower caste. One of girl's family were from Delhi, so it's not even a small town problem.

I don't see caste system being eradicated from most of the country for another 30-50 years. I know people who got 3rd division in SSC and isn't capable of clearing an entrance even if you give him the question paper a month in advance complaining that he couldn't get in because of reservation.

No, son. You didn't get in because you are a fucking moron. Even with reservation the current supreme court consists of almost 95% Brahmins. Imagine the state of our other institutions and the position of Dalit-Bahujan-OBCs if there was no constituitonal guarantee for their education and power. We would have been treated like literal slaves in this Hindu caste culture/religion.",2019-09-20 21:58:55

Policy/Economy,[Rant] India’s BRUTAL tax for the rich,223,ch4zwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ch4zwd/rant_indias_brutal_tax_for_the_rich/,202,"To be honest, I feel this post applies to those who pay tax (regardless of which slab), I’m just putting stuff from my perspective.

There are no two ways to put it, India’s tax on the super rich is ridiculously high. I belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue, the amount certainly is. Money doesn’t come easy and I’ve worked hard for it. Meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes. 

Now tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates. Before any of you’ll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second. For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates. And with the kind of money people from my income category have I can see a lot of them leaving this country for good. 

The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy. What benefits does being wealthy in India get you? Roads are shit, public infrastructure is lacking, incredibly high taxes for luxury items, the list goes on and on.... 
Instead they want to spend my money on statues, stupid ministries like AYUSH, scams, bailing out public sector companies and stuff like that.

Worse, so much money, which I GAVE as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank. Rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them. The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%). (The figures are just examples). We are the source of that money. India is taking a turn to the socialist era, when taxes were even more exorbitant and India was a planned economy. I just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay tax.

EDIT- I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.",billionaireinindia," At what level of income does 42% tax come in? So apparently there are only 5000 such people with such high income and so the impact on the country is marginal. This exactly is why this form of taxation is bullshit. There are way more than 5000 people earning 2 crore and above in India.

All the rest not only evade taxes, they also are contributing to the black economy beause they will be penalized otherwise. If India has to mop up tax revenue, we need to stop treating rich people as criminals and make it easier for them to consume more. And tax that consumption. I, for one, am for higher taxation for the super-rich. But where I am in total agreement with you is what the money is being used for. If it was for developing the nation and social welfare schemes I am all for it, but right now it just lines the pockets of politicians and gives out doles to the vote banks. This sucks. I don't want to pay taxes to make someone else rich or to help someone be in power.

&#x200B;

If you want to move abroad, most (developed) countries have a higher rate of taxation than us. But of course, in most of those cases the taxes are put in to better use.

[This wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates) compares taxation rates between countries, and you'll see most European countries have a very high tax rate. It can go upto 60% in Scandinavian countries, but then again, in those countries you don't have to pay for education or healthcare. In US, the highest tax rate is 50.5% and in Canada 54% (in Nova Scotia). Even Nepal has a 50% income tax for the super-rich! BTW, I'm curious why you dont buy a US green card though? Under EB5, I think they require 3-4 crore invested and even if invested via brokers and so on I've heard you get most of it back after 5 years... You, my friend, may be an exception. I agree with your points. The quality of life is atrocious - high pollution levels , increasing crime , shabby infrastructure and subsidies for everyone apart from the honest tax payers ( white income ). 

If you have the means look at US or Canada and get an OCI card. I know a lot of people who took EB5 visa to US and escaped the drudgery of life in India. If you belong to a super rich community, you should be Getting TFO of the country. Which is what thousands of French  millionaires did when France passed a ridiculous wealth tax law. 

The smart superrich Indians seem to have got the message too

""Stunningly, India in 2017 suffered a net loss of 7,000 members, or 2 percent, of its millionaire population. ""

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/02/opinion/sunday/millionaires-fleeing-migration.html

you can't fight an economically illiterate government, which is rewarded by the electorate with crushing margins of victory despite its economically insane policies. (see demonetization).  Expect this pattern (crazy economic policies, military adventures to whip up 'patriotism', religious rabble rousing etc)  to repeat when the next elections come around in 2024.

  If I were you, I'd be long gone to a country where  at the *least* those kinds of high taxes would at least get me something in return.

PS: If you are really super rich (and not trolling us) , and don't plan to leave, maybe you can help some fellow randians GTFO? Thanks in advance ;-) why are you living in india? Cattle class here and i completely agree with you. The budget was a total disappointment. A majority govt is of no use if it cannot take difficult steps. 

India need to grow faster and we need rich hardworking smart people to do that. 

Farmers are glorified, the subsidies are the reason why loss making farms continue to work, there is no consolidation of farm lands even after 70 years, consolidated farmlands are necessary for large scale mechanisation and higher productivity level in agriculture.

Consolidation of farmland will provide necessary cheap labor at factories which will attract foreign capital. Till the time foreign investments arrive govt should utilise this cheap labor for large infrastructure projects.

But fuck it all, loot the rich hardworking class and feed the poor. There is no point saying such reasonable things in India. People here want even moderately successful people to be double and triple taxed on the same income and support giving freebies to farmers, even if it means our public discoms go into debt and can’t distribute electricity efficiently, or urban citizens suffer from a drought because 80% of a reservoir’s water has been diverted to appease rich farmers who lobby the government. 

People even on this thread are calling for even more welfare spending, without even realizing that the cumulative effect of welfare spending every year is the reason we have less to invest in infrastructure than East Asian nations. 

The government will laugh at you, swindle you, demean your education and achievements and harrass you or libel you to gain votes, and then cozy up to you if you’re successful. 70+ years after independence and our financial capital floods every year, illiteracy is still high, the trains are miserable compared to those in Europe, flat, even roads are a rarity and corruption is still sky-high. 

There are encouraging signs, but God this country takes great effort to make sure everyone everywhere is miserable. Our tax is marginal tax. That means entire income isn't taxed at 30% only the value which goes above the slab. A certain % of total income as tax to everyone seems plausible. It true what he said ; “rich"" farmers are not taxed much. I have seen farmers taking advantage of *karj maafi* to buy a nice cars. I used to complain about this when I used to live in India and I used to be in top slab. But the income inequality in India is extreme. If you live in middle class bubble, it's very easy to forget how widespread poverty is in India. 

The wealth gap you see between even a middle class white collar guy and a minimum wage service job guy is insane here. 

There's no way India can provide the same services as developed countries with so much poverty. It's just not going to happen, as we really need the money to develop and maintain our vast rural country. They really need their development a lot more than our services, and that's the harsh reality. Our roads in cities might be crowded and in bad state, but they don't even have enough schools and health facilities. There are no jobs in rural area, farmers are committing suicides. 

As a part of same country, we all contribute to the government in taxes who then has to prioritize who and where it's required. We have obvious issues with random waste and stupid vanity projects, but you cannot treat tax as something which only you should see the entire benefit of. You are subsidising the poor of the country. That's how it's always going to be in every country, but our country has a lot of poverty. 

This is going to get better, but not overnight. it's going to take time. Democracy is mob rule with less violence. Apart from a few oil rich countries, high income tax for rich people is the norm not the exception. So if you think you are a high net worth individual then you're a free to go to any country in the world but be aware you will pay the same percentage or even more in tax.

&#x200B;

The other point that the tax payer's money is being wasted is a valid one. > The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%).

LMAO Well making money becomes progressively easier the more money you have. So a progressively higher tax slab isn't wrong.

Whether our tax money is put to good use is a different question. And ofcourse if you have the luxury to move to a different country, you totally should. [deleted]  *Only 6,361 individuals declared incomes of over Rs 5 crore.*   
You are in the 1% of 1% of 1%, aren't you? (Good for you.)

&#x200B;

 *Though the maximum marginal rate of 42.74% tax appears high, it is comparable to the highest tax rates in some other countries. In Germany, the UK, Japan and China, 45% tax rate applies to incomes much below Rs 5 crore annually (taking the current rupee-dollar exchange rate). For example, 45% rate applies to income of Rs 2.04 crore in Germany and Rs 2.53 crore in Japan. In the US, for single tax filers, the top tax rate is 37% for income over Rs 3.42 crore.*

Suggestion: Look into hiring a good accountant. I don't think that even Jeff Bezos paid that much as his personal income tax. Sorry I can't hear the voice of the 1-2 people in India who actually declare income above 5 Cr above the 99% who earn far more than that but show their income as 2.4 LPA. Yes, there is no incentive for super-rich who declare taxes to live in India. Unfortunately it won't make a difference to the economy if the rich people leave, as 90% of the economy is unregulated, cash-based and built on black money. I don't think the government was actually planning on collecting more taxes through this announcement, it will just incentivize the folks who are stuck here and can't leave, to hide their income. This announcement was made just to please the gullible middle class and lower strata into thinking the government is being tough on the ""kaminey"" rich folks. For a suitable bribe, most rich folks can get away with not paying the 42% tax. I live in Germany and pay 39% tax. I'm not super rich anywhere, or even rich for that matter. So apart from how the money is being used, I really don't see what you are complaining about. You can afford it. Stop whining. The poor have it much tougher. Most rich in India don't even pay (direct) taxes but do massive tax evasion and are crooked to the bone. The rich are overrated. >I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.

Good point . Add to it , rampant tax evasion by corporates + Lalas + corrupt fuckers in general Arvind Subramaniam in Economic Survey had mentioned this problem of “exit”. 

I totally feel you man, you want the “best” of resources for your tax money. And you should leave the country if you do not like the country, or what it offers. 

Meanwhile, let’s remember Will Durant: A nation is born stoic and dies epicurean. The rest of us cannot emigrate, so we have to make do with what the country has to offer. Or work to improve it.

You mention the “Socialist era” period, I’m guessing your a neo rich. Aka New Money.

Cause in Socialist era, the rich had all the possible amenities, no competition due to inspector raj, and cosy relation with the CONgress party and Bureaucrats.

Nothing wrong with being new money, it’s actually great for the economy that anyone can now become “rich”.

I would like remind you, you have a social debt to your society from which you rose. The Indian Education system, Heath care, subsidised fuel, subsidised LPG etc (economic survey subsidies for the rich). If you emigrate, you would essentially make the government subsidies the foreign government.

Also, there have been cases of racism, xenophobia, and outright eviction of foreigners (Zimbabwe).

If you feel taxes are bad, ask the government to reduce it. Vote for it.

Loan waivers are necessary for YOU also, if the rural economy is in distress, it would create a slowdown in demand, and hence production. Aka Bad for you. Yes loan waivers cannot be a permanent solution, but they are a one time benefit for those, unlike you who would use the resources of the State far more than any farmer would.  

The example is just what aboutism. 

Taxes are your social duty, and let us remember Aristotle who says the feelings of inequality is the biggest cause of revolution. Taxes are redistribution, and beneficial to you as well. Get a Canadian PR. I’ve seen a lot of comments here I wanted to clarify some stuff. First, I’m no Ron Swanson. I gladly pay my taxes on time; however, the amount of tax collected and the way taxes are spent are not mutually exclusive. This may not have been clear in my post. If my money was being spent wisely to actually improve all aspects of the country and to uplift people from poverty I would gladly pay more. But this is not the case. Second, people say that I should leave India (for better or worse). The thing is it’s not that easy. The general perception of people leaving this country is that they out thieves and crooks. If I leave I’m pretty sure I’ll be a fugitive in the eyes of the IT department. Curious question, how much do you earn? Less than 100 crores a year or more? > The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies 

This is absolutely hilarious. Rich get tax breaks and benefits of many kind and they have an easier way of avoiding tax than a middle class salaried employee.

I do agree that tax is too high and accountability too low and the system needs to be reformed in a way that incentivizes paying of taxes rather than finding ways to avoid it because that is cheaper alternative. I empathize with you OP. Just give us some lessons on how to become like you. Hamari gand chiri hui hai. We need an AMA. https://imgur.com/a/mFgmH0a


If a person is earning 7.5 crores per year he is taxed on average at 35%. Not that hight at all. he will be getting around 5crores in hand.

This is without claiming any tax relief.

I agree with the OP on one this money should be used properly and agriculture income after 10 lakhs should be taxed.

Sorry Would you be willing to do an AMA on randia? You won't have to pay any tax once the revolution happens. And it is gonna happen very soon! Hold on for a while bro :) It didn;t help that a senior official of Ministry of Finance stated that the UHNI should not complain becuase they would consume private services in India and abroad. But that misses the mark completely. 

&#x200B;

Also, this thread is a great read with a lot of interesting facts and conversations in this thread. Congrats everyone. Give me an idea about how rich we are talking about here. 10cr a year and 100cr a year are both rich but the solution would perhaps be different. 42% tax on the super rich is actually lower compared to most developed countries. 
But I do get the issue with where the tax money goes to. 
Also, wastage and abuse of tax revenues is prevelant everywhere to some extent. Only way to make it better is with your vote and organizing  through local communities and questioning your representatives. My only input in this is not to think from your perspective what you are getting but from the perspective of others what the government is providing for them.

Whether you like it or not, the government meal schemes, the national highways the power plants, government run hospitals, cheap transportation and much more is being provided from that tax money. Taxes are higher at that income level similar to most developed countries so it gives you incentive to keep investing.  

Most people reduce their taxes at that income level by profiting from capital gains on investments.  Generally capital gains have lower tax for most countries. >For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates.

Why don't you ? Not being sarcastic here, genuinely curious. Since you have already discounted patriotic reasons , there is zero reason for you to stay here. As much as I believe tax rates should be high on the super rich, I believe that it is curenelty a very unfair system. With less than a quarter people actually paying taxes, it is ridiculous to except the small group of law abiding tax payers to pay higher amounts of money to appease everybody. The government should first focus on making sure everybody pays taxes. Hire an accountant, don't pay tax. LoL! Leave if that helps your like. Higher taxes for the top bracket is logical & universal. The utilization of the tax rupees is a different matter & that’s a valid question irrespective of what tax one pays! I hope that the increase the tax on the super rich even more. i am a salaried person and in the same dilemma as you are in right now. lets say i earn 11 lacs after all deductions and investment shown so i would be paying 30% or \~3lac from my 11lac which is way high. i cant imagine what guys like you feel after paying exhorbitant taxes on income of 3cr you'd pay >1cr as taxes in return of what? no roads no infra no special advantages of being the employment generator. at the same time i believe that you'd have to pay the same amount of taxes elsewhere too isnt it? r/LateStageCapitalism

And what about India's rising income inequality? I am a common middle class salaried tax paying citizen and I do not mind paying a higher tax, if that money reaches the poor. In other governments, it used to reach the pockets of politicians. But with DBT, I am hopeful that it will help someone buy food, or help save newborns or get a better toilet. 

From a purely capitalist perspective, you may hold the view that the poor should earn their money instead of accepting handouts from government. But why are the rich hoarding all the money? Why can't they put it to good use, like funding infrastructure? Giving to charity does not count. 

Poverty is a disease created by the capitalists. It is sickening. If you can, you should definitely try getting out of this country mate. Hi. It's me. Your new best friend. >Tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.

Benefits? Do super rich in other countries use public transportation, public hospitals and public schools and colleges? Even if they do, is it because the public ones are better than the private ones or is it because they cannot afford private ones? If they can easily afford the private ones then your argument is moot. Not to mention, to make money and be rich you need to fight the system at every level. The govt tries its hardest to stop you from making money. And despite everything if you do make money they'll take half of it from you. Agree with OP 100% . I see no change in quality of healthcare, education, and useful infrastructure ( roads, street lights, bridges, highways, police stations etc ). It was literally same 20 years ago. Why would anyone pay taxes? I am willing to pay 50% of my income but i want to see changes and i want to see it being used for welfare of others.  

My friend in Germany pays similar tax but Germany has free colleges, free healthcare and provides €400 a month aid that can't support itself ( providing food, shelter, rent, water etc. State covers all of it. So the money is being used to educate people can't afford to and after years they will be able to get jobs, and pay for their own stuff reducing the dependence on welfare money. 

I get very few people pay taxes in India but we have it tough. If i earn 50k per month and want to support a family of 4, I can't. I don't want to live in a shitty apartment with a Activa. I'd want better quality life, do you know how ridiculous tuition and college fees are? I'd want to save money for it. I'd want to save money for my kid's wedding and help them complete their education. If state can't provide free Universities and jobs, I'd save my money to support them instead of paying taxes. if anything, it is inadequate. if we have to seriously combat the growing wealth inequality and ecological disasters, we need a high inheritance tax as well. passing on anything more than a few crores (not tens, not hundreds) down the generation should be a crime.

&#x200B;

just out of curiosity, what do you do? and how much do you make? To be honest if you leave India and abandon business here. That would probably mean that newer people will come up to take your place. The reason taxes are so high is not because of infrastructure or development. It's a bribe by rich people to everyone else to not murder them. Our country is always one bad day away from collapse. If the rich want to stop paying the bribe the entire country will collapse. Maybe that might be a good thing. It’s a progressive tax system. The richer u are the more u get taxed and a lot of countries follow this what’s new The groups of people who don't vote on the election day will get less favor from govt. -Democracy \>The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy

&#x200B;

The govt does not want individuals to be wealthy, they want more people to be in the 5-20 lakhs (or so) range. They would prefer 5 engineers being employed by WITCH companies earning 8L each at 5 years of experience than 1 being employed by a FAANG earning 40L out of college. (The first will show up much better in employment data than the second) My 2 cents. It's not enough. The government provides way too many subsidies and the tax should be even higher imo. > Patriotism and bullshit like that.

People like you are reason why east India company, mughals and Afghans could easily rule us. In india you can’t become super rich by hard work and honesty. There definitely would have been some wrong doing you either committed or condoned or looked the other way. If it was ancestral it’s mostly the money or natural wealth squeezed out of poor people probably belonging to lower caste or tribals. [deleted] Please do tell me what hard work did you put in to ""earn"" that money Just wanted to ask you few things

1. Is 42.7% your effective tax rate or just marginal tax rate of the top bracket?

2. What's your reaction to the taxes on all types of investment (mainly stock market) profits?
I recently read that US doesn't tax long term capital gain of even foreign nationals. Will that make you reconsider investing in Indian market? I mean if I was that rich I would be sad too but what can you do, it's not like you guys are in a position to bring about a change right? With almost all of the citizens for such a reform. The only option is to Emigrate or pay up There's a great passage at the end of The White Tiger where the narrator talks about the cost of having to pay off the police chief to cover up a traffic accident. It's a lot of money. But paying that money is a rich person's problem. Dealing with the accident is a poor person's problem.

At the end of the day, you have the money to be taxed. You are not starving. To suggest that taxation removes the incentive to be rich is ridiculous. [deleted] If you own a business which serves Indian customers, for example a restaurant or clothing brand or any fmcg brand, the tax is justified because your wealth is earned because of the rest of the population. In India, businessmen have advantage of a lot of customers which increases their profit. Now if such a businessman takes their business to another country, it won't work because nowhere else you will find as many customers, plus differences in market needs.

Yes you can move your company to low tax countries like Singapore like some ecommerce companies have done, but that's a loophole govt needs to close.

Compared to a businessman, a working professional can move anywhere because their skill is in demand everywhere, be it white or blue collar job.

Now about tax utilization, that I agree with. If the government will spend tax to fund new businesses, or help scaling existing businesses, that would help more in increasing jobs and tax base. A rich brat ranting in a piss poor country, what a drama queen No man, don't lie",2019-07-24 15:27:33
Policy/Economy,RBI's deputy governor Viral Acharya quits six months before his term ends,99,c4hsqq,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbis-deputy-governor-viral-acharya-quits-six-months-before-his-term-ends/articleshow/69920503.cms,37,,killswitch13," >Acharya has been uncomfortable ever since the exit of Urjit Patel as Governor of RBI. His academic views of the financial system was in contrast with the rest of the system. 

Bichde sabhi baari baari... BC hope there's no announcement coming that he wants to disown. This was bound to happen. Oh this is bad. Very very bad.

Deputy governor is a very important member of the Monetary Policy Committee ( one that decides policy stance and repo rates, basically major macroeconomic decisions ). This 5 member panel has government nominees too and decisions are taken by majority vote. 

Since the decisions are taken by a majority vote, it is always advisable to have majority economists so that RBI policies are not driven by political agendas but only sound economics.

And he was one of the few economists in the panel that constitute the MPC, especially after they replaced an economist with a Bureaucrat as the governor RBI.

So why would he quit? Essentially because there's no point for him to be there as virtual liquidation of RBI as an institution has lead to loss of value of individual opinion. In an organisation dominated by bureaucrats, decisions are now not taken in Mumbai ( RBI HQ ) but in Delhi. 

Terrible news. The off balance sheet borrowing pegs the fiscal deficit at 8-9% of the GDP.

Policy/Economy,Real Talk: India's economic future is screwed and no one can do anything about it,22,e5d76w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5d76w/real_talk_indias_economic_future_is_screwed_and/,8,"I'm starting this based on an assumption: that the only way for lower-middle income countries like India to prosper is through a manufacturing-led, export-oriented economy.

This is the only proven model of prosperity in the 20th and 21st centuries.

This manufacturing can't be just any kind. It has to be low skill, high-volume in order to employ a large number of people. India's current manufacturing pattern is mostly filled with high-skill, low employment products like jewellery, medicine, cars, and software.

It's far easier to train 10,000 people to make iPhone accessories than it is to get them to make cars.

But this kind of high-volume, low skill manufacturing isn't coming to India, regardless of any policy push from the government. 

A few reasons why:

&#x200B;

1. Competitors in SE Asia a) have specialized in certain products (like garments in Bangladesh), b) have fewer roadblocks to investment from the populace (they are autocracies or pseudo-democracies), and c) have a cultural affinity with China (such as Vietnam) which makes it easier for Chinese manufacturers to move shop there.
2. Businesses are built on relationships, not just policy leverage. Policy makers don't get this because very few of them have ever run businesses. By now, American businesses have had decade-long relationships with their Chinese manufacturers. These Chinese manufacturers are now building factories in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. If you were an American business, who would you rather partner with - an unknown entity in India, or the Vietnamese arm of the Chinese manufacturer you know and trust?
3. Supply chains are hard to build and harder to optimize. If you wanted to be a manufacturing power in 2020, you would have had to start work for it in 2015, not 2019. We've lost that moment.
4. India's regional inequality means that the states with cheap labor (Bihar, UP) are also the states where no one wants to invest in because of law and order problems
5. India's democracy means that everything becomes much more challenging for a manufacturer - land acquisition, labor issues, etc. Vietnam, meanwhile, can bulldoze whatever the hell it wants to bulldoze and put up a red carpet for manufacturers.
6. And this might be a biased personal take, but I've felt that Indian manufacturers don't have business competence. I've tried to build products in India as well as China. Our Chinese partners treated us as a small company that might later be a big company, and gave us that respect and priority. Our Indian partner treated us as a small fry and was more keen on getting short-term profit than build a long-term relationship.

I feel that the moment where India could be a manufacturing power is past us. 

Without manufacturing, you'll have a situation where:

&#x200B;

1. The state has to spend more and more on welfare to tackle unemployment among a young population
2. To pay for this welfare, the state will increasingly overreach in tax collection. You're seeing this already where a small section of the population pays nearly all the taxes.
3. The small portion of people who have good jobs will be increasingly resentful of their taxes being spent on welfare. This, coupled with environmental issues, will accelerate brain drain and capital flight.
4. Without the capital and manpower, employment generation will be even slower, forcing the state to squeeze even more. If the welfare dole stops, it knows there is going to be widespread unrest. 
5. All this welfare will tax the state exchequer more and more. We're seeing this already - the government has hit its fiscal deficit target for the year in just 7 months. 
6. One the welfare dole stops, tens of millions of unemployed, angry, poor people will only do what they can do: revolt.

Or is there a silver lining to this cloud?",mrfreeze2000," All popular grievances and administrative obstacles neatly outlined. Financial planners have been giving the government the call for course correction but the government is tone deaf to the problems of the common man. As long as Dalal Street is happy... Silver lining: a lot of these points you mentioned are low hanging fruit for Indian policymakers and industry. For instance, the attitude problem of Indian companies could change with experience, exposure and opportunities. Manufacturing country ship has sailed long ago. 

The future will be driven by A.I. and Manufacturing will be replaced by ROBOTs.

Take a look at any advance Car manufacturer. Lot of work is being designated to Robots and almost a skeleton crew of engineer exist to ensure products are checked to ensure they meet the standard. Also, know as Q&C(quality and control).

Job-like data entry will also be largely replaced. IT will exist for a long time cause they basically ride the code for a lot of these future techs. We will have a lot of Jobless people who need to be re-skilled to meet the demands of the future. We are an agriculture heavy industry. Another thing we boast is cheap healthcare. The future lies in these two sectors. 

Develop these and you are good to go for the next 30 years or so. 

I work in the biotech field. It's a highly niched field where very few products make it to the market after years of R&D. But biotech as such has a lot of overlap with this Healthcare and agriculture. Let's give India 4 years by then if the government and the population show improvement then well else only option left will be to move to some other place.

Where are we doing wrong? What kind of policies do we need to make things better? In which sectors we should focus on more than the other? How can we make our voices heard to the government?

Please refrain from making this thread a political one.",iams3n," Economy is political.

Ha Joon Chang says this in his book, Economics - A user's guide:

>In the old days, no country had a Ministry of Defence. They all had a Ministry of War because, well, war is what it really does. Patents used to be called patent monopolies, as they were (and still are) artificially created monopolies, even though they may be socially useful. So there you have it. Sometimes, an old, forgotten name conveys the essence of the thing it is describing much better than the modern one does.

&#x200B;

>The same goes for the old name of economics – **political economy**, or the study of political management of the economy. 

&#x200B;

>It is not possible to draw a clear boundary between economics and politics. This is because the very boundary of the market is in the end determined by politics and not by an economic theory – of whatever variety.

&#x200B;

>Before we even begin market transactions, we need (explicit and implicit) rules on what can be traded, who can trade them and how they can be traded in the market. All of these rules are restrictive in some ways, and therefore no market is genuinely ‘free’.\* And these ground rules cannot be determined by economic logic. There is no ‘scientific’ list of what should (or shouldn’t) be bought and sold in the market. The decision is a political one.

&#x200B;

>All societies keep certain things off the market – human beings (slavery), human organs, child labour, firearms, public offices, health care, qualifications to practise medicine, human blood, educational certificates and so on. But there is no ‘economic’ reason why any of these should not be bought and sold in markets. Indeed, all of them are or were legal objects of market transactions in different times and places.

I don't know what policies we should make. I would listen to people who have something to say about it instead of calling them anti-national just because they are calling a spade a spade. You asked not to make it political. But the law makers and decision takers need to be economically educated people in the first place. I don't care which color they prefer, they should have at least a master's or a compensable past record on the sector they are focusing on. Sorry, but how can we make this thread a non- political one ?

If the government in power doesn't have a clue or is not ready to frame new policies how can we revive our economy? Centralisation of power is bad for economic growth. The local governments should be given more freedom to form their own policies for economic development. It is a must especially for a big country like India.

A small city in India or a district can't do much to improve its local gdp. The city council or the Zilla Parishad don't have the sufficient funds or freedom to do it.

However, an US city can attract investors by giving them special tax breaks or cheap electricity. It is the same in China. The cities of China compete with each other to attract investment. They also have sufficient funds to develop and maintain their infrastructure without waiting for the help of the state or federal government. See ,when uve got an  FM sharing Ola /Uber   Whatts app  based forwards ,..or a Minister of Law and Justice bringing out Movie collection's to show that the economy is blooming ..or when uve got the PM making constant claims of turning India into a 5 trillion economy at 5% GDP .. there's little to no hope ..get in educated Economists ,who'll chart an actual roadmap ..if not , this is a sinking ship ..and we're all ferrying on it ..🚢 The recession is not purely cyclical, it's systemic. It's kind of an 'Indian made' calamity. We knew it was coming, just not that it would hit so soon(demo, and then gst aagravated it and it hit us way harder).

The failure of major-scale capitalism in certain sectors was expected. The failure of our 'socialist' undertakings was also expected. People have been talking about it for years. However, since it's expected, it's was manageable and avoidable.

But that's where we failed, since we elected the current government which led to the major economic mismanagement which is going on.

Those who say that only the current government caused it  are not completely right. This economic calamity we see was a natural thing coming, but some decisions made without long term analysis brought it way too soon. This is where we got fucked. Economic cycles happen, structural problems happen, and people are paid massive amounts of money to keep track of it.


In short: we knew it was coming, we didn't know we'll manage it SO BADLY. And yeah, you can blame the government. In my opinion the government should take a 3 step approach to tackle sluggish demand and slowdown

Step1:

Disinvest Air India, MTNL, BSNL to start with - This will reduce the fiscal deficit burden

Bring oil under GST ambit - not easy - Congress perished taking consent on this from the states

1 GST rate(preferably between 5% to 10%) and simpler filing norms for all items, The confusion and the frequent changes has caused massive uncertainty amongst small and medium scale traders and businesses, the MRP on all items should be inclusive of tax

Step2:

1. Do not bail out firms like DHFL, IL&FS etc - Let them bleed, it would cause trauma for 2 to 3 quarters but the lending will be vigilent and risk mitigating measures would be taken once the firms are aware that they are on their own and the government wont be bailing out on them and repercussions might include jail-time


2. Reduce taxation from 30%+cess to 20%+cess for anyone under 50 lac salary - this is the population which really go out and spend since they aspire to be rich, wear branded clothes, phones, buy automobile, buy houses. This would also lead to more tax filings and can lead to increase in tax collection


3.   Focus on Agrarian distress and start redistributing the money received from disinvestment and GST collection without putting burden on the fiscal targets

Step3:

1. Focus on education - cut defense spending and increase spending on primary and high school education - increase teacher salaries so that it becomes lucrative for people to take it up as a serious profession and bring innovation in this sector.

2. Bring government banks and cooperative banks under the RBI scrutiny and not state and union governments which are prone to corruption and money laundering pre and post elections

3. Cut Interest rates so that home-loans are in the range of 5-7% so that mortgage market and the biggest stable and secured source of income of banks is maintained

4. Reduce dependency on oil import, this is putting massive a dent in our GDP and also it would protect the environment but this is only possible once we have better rail gauges, high speed freight trains and loading and unloading costs and tariffs are marginalized.

There are many other measures government can adopt but given the short-term 4-5 year goals, If I see atleast half the measures getting adopted, we will see a lot of poverty alleviated. You asked not to make it political. But the law makers and decision takers need to be economically educated people in the first place. I don't care which color they prefer, they should have at least a master's or a commendable past record on the sector they are focusing on. > Where are we doing wrong?

This recent interview with a former advisor to the govt. Pronab Sen goes into some of this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na2WDrRif3M) -

*... Sen says that the government doesn't seem to have a game plan to fulfil the 5 trillion economy promise. He explains what the government ought to do to revive the economy– by prioritising growth and employment generation in the rural sector. Sen also assess two flagship schemes of the Modi government – Mudra Yojna and  PM Kisan Yojna in this interview.*

>> IMO, one thing we are definitely doing wrong is not defining ""we"" properly. I'd prefer a ""we"" that treats each citizen of India as an individual with potential, and then come up with ways to self-help as well as help one another rise into better economic situations. This could be through local entrepreneurship ideas and partnerships, meetups, training camps, volunteering, skill sharing, side jobs, investments, even emigration. Rather than be stuck in a salaried job totally at the mercy of company and government finances.  It's better to have a weak centre with 29 states each of which is a standalone liberal economic powerhouse like norway or sweden. The scope of ""we"" should be maxed out at state level, and then scaled down to district, city, town, area and individual levels with different policies at each level.

And not a ""we"" where somehow the central government and its party's economic goals are treated as a proxy for each individual's economic well-being. Where it's treated as a given that if central government reaches their $5T goal, it implies all 1.3B individuals have $3.8K income. I have always viewed all our governments and their employees as being adversarial and small-minded (redtape, bribery, influence-peddling, threats, etc) rather than supportive, and this particular govt is more so than normal. There's no point in ideating policies for central government's benefit - let them solve their own shit.  

>Please refrain from making this thread a political one.

Is it even possible? The economy is linked to politics. It always is. Filling all institutes with yes-sir men. They don't have the guts to confront the govt and ask them to take the correct steps. Manufacturing/Industrial output and wages.

This is what I would focus on. But I’m not in the government, so... It would be better if the government devises a long-term strategy rather than appeasing the corporates with the regular tax cuts hoping the investments to happen. India being an agrarian country investments in agricultural sector needs to be made the top most priority and, calculated and systematic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing sector should done to generate jobs. I think we are in for some  hard times. Reasons have been given by top economists, which our Govt refuses to acknowledge publicly.  How will it pan out, I don't know.

Having said that some sectors like white goods are upbeat and adding capacity, when auto and others are retrenching heavily.

You have to put more money in hands of people to boost consumption. Govt has to figure out how. Not an easy job and I think FM Nirmala Sitharaman is realizing  that now. And most of her colleagues are speaking bullshit.

 ""pappu"" government in my opinion. I'm from
 Hyderabad, so, I never had to vote for Congress or
 the BJP and I'm happy about not having to choose
 one of them. Congress had some questionable
 policies but the situation the BJP has led our country
 into, I mean It's Outrageous.

 I've never seen Modi  commenting on the Unnao rape victim. I've never  seen him assure the country about the current economic situation. He simply doesn't seem to care. Poor Tulsi, lost some of her followers for meeting Modi. Such is the impression that our beloved PM has on the international stage. I don't know, I don't see these Modi praisers talking about the economy at all. I am a little inclined to the right more than the left but this is just shameful that this guy called Modi has led us into this pit. I've never seen him addressing the nation on the issues at ground level. All he does is spew out patriotic and emotional bullshit. I am patriotic and all but it alarms me that our PM has no say in the mob lynchings. I'm from Hyderabad, I live in a population dominated by Hindu and Muslimcommunity's. There have been minor clashes here and there but there were no riots and no bad blood between the two communities. Hell, I have so many Muslim friends, but growing up with them I've never felt the difference between my Hindu and Muslim friends. 

You see, with all these lynchings and forcing
 of Jai Shree Ram slogans has affected one way or the
 other. Before all this crap, we used to break each
 others balls, make fun of the religions and never got
 anyone offended. Suddenly, I look around now and
 we are still the same mates we were, but we think
 twice before bringing up a religious joke. That's what
the Modi government has given us. Everybody has
 the internet, everyone knows what's happening, this
 has to be addressed. Our country's economy, our
 secularism, our linguistic freedom, have all gone
 down the drain and when these right wing people
 talk about Modi as if he descended from the whitest
 clouds, it makes my skin crawl.",Travis_Bickle96," Unrelated advice: please use line breaks in your future posts. Gave up reading your post in a moving car. I'm from Hyderabad and I totally agree. I'm on mobile and reading your post seems like you're slightly left aligned Indian political line is completely imbalanced. You are calling yourself more inclined to the right and you may be correct in that but from indian perspective you are a liberal and left - wing or libratd from a rw perspective. Even in this sub where people represent themselves as leftwing doesn't support communism or they are more near to center of political spectrum . 

You can say that India political spectrum is dominated by right wing extremists with no left wing extremists to balance them. And extremism is always bad. I usually refrain for commenting on politics here apart from a few sly remarks here and there.No one in the Indian polity cares about the middle class general category students and job seekers.That's how I feel about it at 22.A conclusion drawn on the basis of my observation and analysis.The reason I don't indulge excessively in the clusterfuck of political discussions is due to this thought that  no political party when  in power would care a fig about us[Reiterating ki aadat] The cult of personality is a huge problem. I wasn't around during the Indira Gandhi era so I have no idea what that was like but I've never seen anything like this before. The supreme leader meme is real life now. Being a moderate hindu conservative, I have to agree. India has become extremely dangerous for people who aren't hindu. Heck, I a saw a reporter writing about how BJP is not doing enough for hindus. If you think this is bad, wait for the future. The BJP will go all out to create a surveillance state, in which all dissent will be crushed. They are already pushing for Facebook and other tech Giants to break their encryption. The case is in the SC, but when was the last time the SC delivered a verdict against the Government? 

Their will be elections, and perhaps they would be fair too, but because of the constant propaganda spread by the media and the government, they will win a majority everytime. 

Democracy doesn't die in one night. You don't suddenly wake up in the morning, with the Constitution gone. It happens bit by bit, piece by piece. Everyday you lose a part of your freedom.  Oh they banned Reddit, porn, Wikipedia? No worries, I'll just use a VPN. But there will be a day, where there will be no VPNs, no computers, no Internet, and no life as we know it today. 

There will only be leaders, and people who kneel before them. Somebody copy paste without those line gaps. Please. > Before all this crap, we used to break each others balls, make fun of the religions and never got anyone offended.

Same here. Earlier it was a joke, and it was understood among my circle that there were no malicious intentions. Now it all became real, or rather it was not 'real' atleast among my circle (young teens, 20s men). The same joke you used to make for fun, now you see a BJP retard saying it, whipping up a crowd to violence, etc. Dude format your post properly Bruh... edit this > Poor Tulsi, lost some of her followers for meeting Modi.

That was perhaps expected as the far left hates both Modi and Trump with a passion. I just followed her on twitter, hopefully more will do so and it'll balance out. The most annoying part imo is that there's no real sensible opposition party. Congress is a stale shitshow and other regional parties cant do anything. And dont even get me started on the communists. >PM has no say in the mob lynchings. I'm from Hyderabad, I live in a population dominated by Hindu and Muslim community's. There have been minor clashes here and there but there were no riots and no bad blood between the two communities.

So, if you hate right wingers so much why would you elect politicians like owaisi repeatedly? I guess you guys are too young to remember the glory days of the 90s when India was literally burning with caste politics, terrorism in Punjab, in Kashmir and Delhi especially was flooded with pandits who were refugees in your own country.

I was a little girl then, but I cannot imagine now what political instability and intense divisions that existed in society then. 

These are the facts: 
- None of Modi government's schemes have favoured one community at the disadvantage of the other. 
- The only exception to the above is Triple Talaaq bill, which is SC-driven, but there is no way this was being brought in by Congress (google Shah Bano case to see how Muslim women in India were set back into the stone age by so-called democratic/secular forces). This was to the advantage of Muslims in general.  Because what benefits women of a community = whole community benefit.
- Even demonetisation was preceded by drive to open bank accounts of the poorest. 
- There has been electrification of villages at a faster rate than the preceding Congress govt
- There have been subsidies on gas that have directly benefitted the poorest women. You probably don't know jack about cooking, so may not understand.
- My favourite part is the speech on 15th August 2015 re toilets, from the Red Fort. I have been a fan of Modi since then because I see a genuine drive to address basic needs of the people by this government.

I don't know why I am responding to your vitriol to be honest, but India has just concluded the largest election ever and handed an even bigger victory to Modi. If secularism and freedom etc were going down the drain, then you wouldn't be airing your opinion on this sub. 

The opposition leader literally called the PM a murderer/liar. You know what happened? Like any fascist dictatorship, he was.... challenged in the court, and lost. That surely is depth of fascism isn't it? 

You know whom I supported in Delhi? Kejriwal - because of the way Nirbhaya case was put in the limelight. 

What has he done for women's safety in Delhi? Jack. Don't tell me free Metro rides, because that's an election jumla which is not going to give any benefits. If it was then it wouldn't have been announced 4 years 9 months into his term.

What's more important than speaking from a podium about an issue is doing something about it. The Unnao rape accused has been arrested.

The violence yesterday at JNU - as the police stood by and let it happen- is unbelievably tragic and heartbreaking.

Last 6 months have been really dark days for our democracy. Between the authoritarian decision to scrap Article 370 without any consultation from Kashmiri leaders or population; the rampant Internet shutdowns and Article 144 evocations; CAA/NRC and the police brutality against minorities; and the disastrous state of our economy, I think our Government has crossed a line.

I can no longer give them the benefit of doubt. We all stood by and let an asinine policy like demonetization happen, thinking it was just a misguided Government working for the greater good. We didn't even flinch as administration took no action against increasing communal violence, and recruited criminals and openly communal leaders. But it's not a time to remain apolitical anymore.

At this point, I firmly believe Government has run out of chances. If we continue to support it and do not protest against the blatantly unjust laws, we are looking at irreversible damage to our social fabric. The economy is already in a pretty bad state by nearly every metric except the top 20 companies. 

I implore upon everyone still reading this post to think about everything that has happened under our Government. I don't believe in telling anyone to support a particular person or party, but I urge everyone to give a long hard look if they voted for our ruling party. The ongoing protests and everyone raising voices against these laws make me believe that we can still survive this, and come out stronger. I hope we are able to.",ABrightPlace,,2020-01-07 02:36:37

It was below their dignity to take something that is so cheap. However, Vodafone would not capitalize on this amazing brand value. Instead, they leeched on to these users without upgrading their network. Eventually, everyone bought a second sim from Jio and slowly it became their primary sim. Later, a few fully jumped to Jio.

Jio was literally too good and Vodafone was too slow. Look at how Airtel fights Jio and keeps upgrading. Vodafone tried to squeeze far too much and instead had nothing to hold on to! Great gift from Pranab Mukherjee. While he gets a Bharat Ratna, his actions will probably result in the exit of one of the highest investors in India. Reliance entering a mature market and going all guns blazing pocketing govt and policy makers to get a foothold in the telecom market is an indication of future potential.   All the praises being sung about by the analysts is sounding alarm bells.   These narratives are being spun to sell these businesses off to public successfully.   With slowdown hitting the economy locally and globally, Reliance is going to suffer disproportionately due to its legs in highly sensitive retail sector.   Other way to look at it is also wasting of capital or capacity in the industry(telecom).   No. Of companies gone bankrupt and capital extinguished due recklessness of Reliance is costing the country in terms of jobs and tax revenues. The govt. favoured Reliance by policies and rule changes without which Reliance would not made any headway either in telecom or oil & gas.   Consumers have benefited is a silver lining, but costs is paid by other sections of economy in terms of job losses, NPAS and consequently lack of capital to necessary sectors that require investment.   Reliance could have been more socially responsible by subsidised fuel from its refinery that would have had multiplier effect on the economy by reducing the costs of transportation.   Reducing telecom rates have helped bollywood and made people distracted from self development and watch medias/videos during their work hours.   Today all the additional data is used majorly to watch entertainment videos and in turn this brings down productivity and aggregate of that to a certain degree contributes to economic incompetence and slowdown.",2019-09-09 15:20:51

We all know, we Indians have so much potential. We are one of the first most advanced and most peaceful civilization, dating back to around 3000 BC. We have invented cotton, textiles, weapons, Ayurveda, yoga, languages, surgery and the list continues.

https://i.redd.it/qvsb1wf9vut31.jpg

Since independence, we have achieved great growth and have lifted many people out of extreme poverty. However, this growth has been slow and patchy to say the least. Our current government is resolute however slightly clueless. Topics like economy, health, education are extremely tricky to solve for a massive and diverse state like India.

We need to create a repository of ideas, and have the best minds of the country (IAS, professors of national institutes, researchers, economists, students) discuss the ideas and assist the government in prioritizing which policies to implement.

I dream of creating an invite only platform for such people to submit and discuss the ideas and policies. I want our country to move away from discussing politics and religion. I want our narrative to change towards ideas and policies that can help propel this extremely capable nation of 1.3 billion people to a brighter future.

I have attached a mock-up of how I envision the portal to look like. Key features:

* Sign up using Aadhar OTP
* anybody can view the discussion but to vote, comments and engage you need to sign up
* initially invite only for the best minds in our country
* people can submit ideas
* ideas segregated in a manner our central cabinet is segregated
* politics and religion agnostic discussion
* No advertisement

I haves full time job however I am extremely passionate about India and this cause. I am looking for people who can make this vision a reality. I need people who can code, I can myself do the designing (photoshop) and assist with the setting side of stuff. I need people to help me in marketing the platform as well to top minds of our country.

Anybody who cares for this and believes in this, please comment and DM me

Open to hearing your ideas, and criticism",Wings_of_blade," Even though your idea is hopeful, i would suggest think this thoroughly. Why would any user search, register and engage in conversations. I don't see this product either market validated, User researched or monetarily planned.

The best minds are already doing their bits for this country, some are in R&D, some with businesses etc. The major problems i believe are with  bureaucracy, Lobbying and private networks. Which will need more than a web platform to have. 
Even in startup world, companies need 1-1 tie-ups for Sales and expansion hence the networks too. mygov.in exists. It  is an platform to build a partnership between Citizens and Government with the help of technology for growth and development of India. Point 2 is disconcerting me.you are talking about PSU's to share their productivity data (in terms of resource allocation,head count, revenue etc) with your framework.This would require large datamart to be created .then comes the bureaucracy hurdles. I hope your from IIM/IIT with good backing from reputable organisations or from private ventures OP here. These are some of the ideas/policies that I had jotted down in my notebooks over last few months.

1. Have increasing made in India requirements on retailers in the areas where Indian industry is already competitive, so that at least out competitive industries are not killed  - Zara, H&M, Ikea, Uniqlo, mini so, firstcry, etc textiles, plastics, furniture, chemicals and paints
2. Create a consortium of all state-owned energy companies (BPCL, ONGC, IOCL etc) and provide support to setup a world scale massive solar panel and EV batter manufacturing unit in India
3. Train workforce on a war footing - construction, textiles, metal work, wood work etc.  
4. Show ""made in country"" labels on amazon and every e-commerce website on product thumbnail. Govt. should periodically collect numbers from e-commerce websites about percentage of made in India goods sold on their website to see the trends. The idea is good, but what it lacks is enforceability. Once we brainstorm all ideas, them what. How do we get these things out in the field? Utterly brainless idea.

Does the govt not already have the top minds & experts with the right qualifications ???!!

And somehow some cobbled together portal can somehow collect a bunch of random nobodies to do a better job than experts who are already working on this day & night. 

Yeah we know the govt is not efficient in many ways & politics etc. But there is zero hope & no credibility of your motely crewn to be any better or have any influence over the govt.

Smell the coffee. The developer in me says that you should start with a reddit clone or hacker news clone from github and just mess around a bit. The realist in me says you are trying to use tech to solve a people problem, your idea would just generate some buzz (IF done right) and also need a massive backing from a ton of important people who would be ideally better of doing what they do best. is this trolling?",2019-10-21 16:23:55

Policy/Economy,[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets?,14,di5x69,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/di5x69/askindia_why_do_we_have_so_much_distrust_of/,16,"Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government.",ohdickens," I remember, in the early 90s, my cousin brother endeavored to start a toy manufacturing company. It took a year and half to get all the permissions regarding land usage and taxes.

When he finally got to the stage of producing toys, he was already in losses as the interest for the loan kept pilling up (He had taken loans for machinery, which lay idle for a year, as he could not get permissions for manufacturing). When he finally started, he had to price the toys higher to offset some of the increasing debt. 

But then, if you remember, extremely cheap Chinese toys flooded the market (post-liberalization) and he had to declare bankruptcy after 4 years and close the company.

All because of red tapism.

This relates to point 5 of yours. I believe it has to do more with the Indian capitalists rather than to do with capitalism as such. 

Indian capitalists such as Nirav Modi and Ramalinga Raju who had successful business empire yet resorted to illegal activities. Sure there are illegal activities everywhere such as Enron scandal. But Indian businesses are too profit oriented, they treat their customers like shit. Before the entry of MNC in India, many Indian businesses had no policy of return even if the goods were damaged, they would instead blame the customer and government made slogans such as buyers beware. I still remember in early 90s how one of the big conservative textile shop in my city had a no return policy, they refused to take back damaged good they had sold us, I went to the same shop this year, they had a 15 days return policy what a surprise. 

MNCs changed all this but still people had a sour experience in general with these Indian capitalists add to the fact the MNCs remind them about East India company from our history text books. 

When the Indian businesses change their shitty outlook, Indians would start trusting them. Wtf....you cited Ambani and Adani as having no competition. Are you real?

Let's take the, telecoms sector and new entrant JIO. JIO came in and destroyed all the competition by lowering price that made most telecom companies either merge or go bust. 

A good Telecom regulator would have in some way prevented predatory pricing allowing fair competition to all players in this sector. **Every news be like - Government is God** I think the second point relates to affordability. Do people have choice with the amount of money they have or how many people with that kind of money do we have? The problem is not that we are taught capitalism incorrectly, the problem is that we are not taught capitalism at all. We have been having bad leaders for a really long time now. Political parties have been playing with the emotions of the poor by spreading lies about 'the wealthy'. They also know that it is easier to win an election by giving freebies and loan waivers than actually giving a damn about long term policies. The distrust is because of bad leaders hiding their incompetency behind lies Indian society is a low trust society as it is. I don't know the historical and sociological processes that have turned it this way, but it is what it is. It's made worse at the street level by the neighbourhood shopkeeper who isn't exactly a model of honesty anywhere in India. Even bigger businesses aren't exactly ethical with their customers, are they? Probably, the deep distrust of businesses stems from these two factors. It's not entirely unwarranted. A poor justice system and the role of influence in law enforcement means it's better to start with distrust and be overcautious, rather than trust and lose money.

&#x200B;

At a government level, Nehru had the biggest influence in how governments look at businesses. As somebody who had seen the bad effects of colonial capitalist greed on our society, he was instinctively anti-capitalist. That attitude grew worse with Indira when highest levels of taxation on businessmen were imposed in the 70s and 80s. Naturally, they preferred to launder it to tax havens, and I think it is this image of tax-evading businesses that has been imprinted in the modern Indian bureaucrat's and citizen's mind. OMG dude, what have you done! You talked about...capitalism...here!? Oh god, prepare to be bashed and the downvotes.

Well jokes aside, the recent emergence of socialists in America and India are reactionary. Humans are shitheads and when they came to know this, since they can't blame humans, they are taking their anger out on the system - capitalism. Nice scapegoat. You have a problem with your relations? Capitalism. You have problem of diarrhea? Capitalism. The grocer charged you 2 rupees extra? Capitalism. The environment is degrading? Capitalism. As if Adam Smith wrote in his book to do all these.

The right wingers think ""government bad, corporates good"" while leftists think ""government good, corporates bad"". Both are right and wrong in their own way. Rightists understand that markets are important and that centrally planned economy and too much rules and regulations hurt the economy. And leftists are right in the sense that they understand that crony capitalism is harmful and that too many wrong risks can create depression/recession during which the government has to intervene (2008 global crisis). Currently, since right wing is on the rise, there is a reactionary socialist movement, that's all.",2019-10-15 18:25:30

1) Lack of new job creation, decrease in purchasing power, negligible increase in either headline inflation or core inflation, 2-3% gdp growth rate, if we calculate gdp using previous base year, has substantiated that we are or are heading to recession. Recession doesn't always mean negative gdp growth rate. 

2) Uncertain and draconian policy : Fast changing policies which have proved to be bereft of commitment by actual spending and pervading religious divide and ideology is eating away a part of budget.


Damocles Sword

3) Infrastructure projects underway, but for whome? Bullet train, statues and home creation, but none of them are infrastructure investment which will help economy at scale and will come out to bite few years later.

4) Migrating tendency : Large mobilisation by semi-elite and educated group due to ease of getting residential cards given that you are competent. It should increase by substantial amount after global economy slow down is over and again will bite back later due to the fact that with lack of skilled man power fewer companies will invest


Deflation & Lack of buffer and misguided policies

5) Corporation tax cut : Current situation is because of lack of purchasing power even among those who are employed and even a cursory glance at past will tell that India has never seen tickle down Impact so I don't expect increase in PP 1) It will fail to attract new investment 2) Goods may get cheaper which will lead to deflation.

6) Possible Deflation : With lack of buffer and policy failure, we will spiral down to deflation and products will get cheaper but people will start losing jobs at hitherto rate.

New minted currency as catalyst to breaking economic cycle and perhaps for even worse 

7) Bottleneck Inflation leading to stagflation : Demand will stay the same or may even increase while infrastructure will be severely lacking and to boost economy, we may see new minted currencies and it will lead to rising prices(inflation) but job loss will still stay the same

INR will get devalued significantly to attract investment and will further push outward mobilisation.",lightnh," [deleted] Things certainly look shitty but it may be too early to call it a doomsday kind of scenario.  Govt fucked up and have realized their mistakes.  They are too egoistic to admit their mistakes but have reverted back some of their shitty moves.  The corporate tax cut is not going to fix demand issues directly or right away but can help attract some of the investments moving out of China. That can be a huge plus in the years to come.

Bullet train looks like a white elephant currently but if you think, wouldnt be great to have world class trains here like other developed countries?  And not just for ornamental reasons or for the politics of it.  Imagine the growth of business if Bangalore - Chennai or other similar places, the travel can be done within 2 hours?  Infrastructure investments otherwise is a good thing - the roadways, tunnels and waterways will help future generations.  If anything we need to have even more infra development projects.  Dont we love the infra of foreign countries?  These projects dont happen over night and need hige amount of planning and vision. Infra projects also provide employment to thousands of people, which helps with GDP and helping with demand side issues.

Migration has always been a thing. There is nothing new about it. All the people participating in ""Howdy Modi!"" are people who migrated out of the country looking for better prospects. Isnt it?  It may be another topic all together that they assume it to be their moral and birth right to comment on what is good or bad for India. We are country of 1.3 billion people.  Few crores people migrating will not necessarily hurt us. if at all it can help bring in remittance.  Yes, brain drain is a thing. It has been around for generations and I don't see it reducing anytime soon.  Perhaps spreading of rightwingers Govt everywhere in the world may mitigate it a bit due to racism etc.

Yes, there are draconian policies and misadventures like Demon, shitty GST implementation, ugly and useless statues etc.. But good economics does not necessarily mean good politics.  And to win elections, one needs good politics and optics.  The wrath of the market forced Govt to rollback some of their shitty policies.  The euphoria behind corp tax cut may not last forever, and pure economics may start playing.  And as i started off, it may be too early to call it a May Day! Good points. Work on your exit plan.

I think it makes Modi a globalist, he's not closed the economy to foreign investment or anything, unlike trump who has actively blocked investment from china and put a whole lot of tariffs on different products.

Policy/Economy,[Rant] Criminalization of CSR is another pain for companies,65,cmndkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cmndkk/rant_criminalization_of_csr_is_another_pain_for/,29,"This is another sort of rant about a bad policy by the government. Id first like to clear something up. I’m NOT against mandatory  CSR. I personally don’t like the very idea of mandatory CSR but since it’s law, our company fully complies with all CSR requirements. It’s just the way the government is amending it to make non compliance a criminal offense that is problematic. Let me explain: 

When a corporation is profitable, it pays corporate tax. On top of that, it generates jobs and wealth for individuals and provides valuable goods and services. This boosts the economy. When companies do CSR, they are essentially doing social service and there is nothing wrong in that. 

The problem is why the bloody hell does the government want to criminalize it? I know that non compliance is an issue but this just makes it an additional headache for companies. The compliance officer may not have the same view of CSR as companies do and will eventually end up harassing us. Since there is no concrete framework for CSR i.e. what is and what isn’t CSR, it is largely open to interpretation. And if the government puts another bureaucrat they’ll have absolutely no idea on CSR. 

In fact, I don’t even understand why the government is doing this. The last time I checked, CSR compliance is at 91.25%. There are certain policies (such as the tax on the super rich) which is vote bank politics but this effectively starts an ‘inspector raj’ all over again. 

And if companies have left over money for CSR, we have to deposit in an escrow account after 3 years?! We are not criminals. We WILL eventually use that money. The government is literally putting its hand in our pockets! This is a sad state of affairs. We aspire to be a 5 trillion dollar economy. The government wants ‘animal spirit’. And the ease of doing business here is being dragged down.",billionaireinindia," I always feel CSR is unethical. Companies are paying tax and that is their social responsibilty and that is it. Now another 2% and than making it compulsory is just wrong. It like tax not paid to government over the tax paid directly to govt. Btw i am happy that you own a 500cr turnover company. [removed] This govt is making a big F mess of our economy... Also note that the government often leans on companies to provide funding for statues and other nonsense. I would just put a blanket provision in place saying all CSR funds go towards local government schools proportioned by number of employees of that company in a given location. You are correct. Companies should just be nationalized so that 100% of the work goes towards the community instead of the tiny % that goes towards CSR. All the points you stated about employment, wealth creation in the community, etc. will still be true and nobody will have to deal with such regulatory burdens. To be fair, the 'criminalisation' you refer to has always been there ever since it was introduced. CSR's non-compliance has always had (one of the) penalty as imprisonment. They haven't really changed the penal provisions with the amendment, just the enforcement strictness. From all practical perspective, (till now) non-compliance usually leads to compounding (basically a fine) and very very rarely leads to imprisonment (at least I'm not aware of any). I think from an enforcement perspective, they want to tighten things and make sure the companies are not just 'clicking pictures' and doing the CSR but are actually doing the work (or getting it done).

But you're right, the compliance officer might not be on the same page with respect to the CSR activities which can be troublesome to explain and (to show that he's doing his job and being strict n all), it may lead to unnecessary procedures and countless explanations. But then again, that's the thing with any compliance that is done in India. The finance minister is from JNU....................... Hello fellow 500 cr company stakeholder! Forcing companies to do CSR is good. The existence of the companies is net negative interms of benefit to society. If companies do CSR they interact direcly with society and understand some of the negative aspects of their existence and behavior.",2019-08-06 15:12:42

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Satyamev Jayate.",toughbrain," 1. Are you anywhere else other than facebook?
2. Don't you think Humanism is a highly misunderstood word and it might only drive people away if getting people to you is your idea?
3. I see you have a highly ambitious vision (though vague here) is really appreciable. I will take a peek into it. Aaaah, the walls of text just got 10 feet higher. Damn, that took a while to settle in! I really like the fact that someone in India is actually trying to setup grass roots for humanity development and management.

A few tips from my side:

1) It'd be really awesome if you had a subreddit, cuz Facebook can become really Obnoxious, what with all the meme pages, and all the hundreds of friends that people can have. Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.

2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first? Cuz I think if you'd start with one, you might slowly reach state-level, which is more than enough to get the nation's attention. I like your long term approach. Anything is possible with tenacity and will power. Good luck to you. The trouble with your plan is that it will strike the vast majority of Indians as being culturally inauthentic. The idea as presented simply is not Indian. It is just an artificial and weird mish-mash of a lot of things that seem to look good at this stage in history (2019), but it doesn't have deep roots in the soul and soil of the land.

BJP is successful because they have a vision for India that (as per their narrative) is as ancient as our earliest recollections of India itself. This vision is made of songs and stories and Gods and saints that are deeply embedded in a lot of Indians' consciousness and their understanding of who we are. They can cite ancient scriptures as sources of the values they advocate. Their imagery and rhetoric have deep roots in the nation's history. Take the icon of mother India or Bharat Mata. Some say that this idea is just a copy of the corresponding European ideas, but every Hindu sees Bharat Mata as just another instance of Shakti, the mother goddess, which is an idea that has deep roots in the Hindu psyche nourished by a vast fund of religious literature and practices.

What RSS achieved over 50 years is only possible if you believe strongly in one ideology. Religion and their rules are a tool to make people cooperate on a large scale, without which they will not. 

I feel it's impossible to create organized movements in that kind of way anymore, unless you use a strong ideology to unite people. But if you do that, it will create blind faith and extremism and that will be counter your original purpose. Moreover, it will counter act against one of the most important qualities that people need in India - Individualism. 

Look at the best countries across the world, they don't have any popular organized groups throughout the country. The Vegan community is the closest comparision I can think of in those countries and even vegans are famous for being intolerant, adhering to their strictly enforced guidelines within the community. As soon as you place the identitiy of a community or a group above an individual, it will lead to the same result. The devloped countries and their institutions are succesful because the majority doesnt beleive in any single ideology strongly, all of them value individual thoughts so it becomes impossible to compromise everything, all at once. 

Therefore, I don't think you should try to replicate their success. But I also don't know a solution to how it can be possible to impart these important values without making under a banner. I really like this idea, and to be honest I was thinking of something like this myself. I'd really like to join, or at the very least contribute to discussions and present ideas and solutions.
 In addition, somebody mentioned here that the ideology might not appeal to Indians the same way that hindutva does and I believe their statement holds a lot of truth. AAP is an example, so it should be a priority to figure out how to strongly appeal to the masses. 

Overall, I want to thank you for being the change you want to see and for actually doing something lol. Please make a sub, not everyone of us are in FB. Police Reforms are the key to unlock the India's potential, How else do you think we can bring fear in the minds of criminals in India? If this takes off, it'd be great!  
I look forward to casting my vote for the IhP one day!

&#x200B;

My only concern is, I don't think your message and philosophy will resonate with the same electorate that voted 'Hindutva Eva Jayate' into power. What's your views on North south cultural divide, LGBT rights? And I'd like to repeat a question someone else had raised is there any place you'd begin, a movement starts only if you begin and progress continually. Indians: Neva! > But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. 



This statement is similar to that of Holocaust deniers. Caste system and discrimination are sins of ancestors, you can't say Muslim are responsible, or reservation cemented caste identities.


I would like to see study or source which says caste identities were less fixed before implementation of reservation in 1947. I repeat, your statement is similar to telling Jewish people that Nazis were not responsible for Holocaust. You can't whitewash thousand year history.






> This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.


Mandal politics came as reply to kamandal politics. Dalits voted Lalu yadav because ranveer Sena did yadav/dalit massacres. Check the links between murli manohar Joshi and ranveer Sena.



Poverty in backward castes was reduced from 1991. Incidentally that was the time when caste based identity politics started. Your claims that identity politics has hurt dalits won't be accepted by even forward castes.










> Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world.

250 million dalits are richer than ST and Muslims. Check facts.

> We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. 

Lol. I can't even. 

> When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. 


It's not about education, it's about ""equal opportunity"". You stop discrimination and it's enough for dalit progress.

> This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system.

How can you give justice to 70% SC,ST,OBC when there is zero judge in supreme Court from these castes? What about 90% supreme Court judges being brahmins?



> We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community 

Are you quoting Sumitra mahajan and her chocolate and kids comment about dalits?

> on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.


But there is persuasive evidence for that. 

> Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.







Your assumption that SC,ST wont vote for you if you said anything against reservation is absurd. You have freedom of expression which dalits respect. BJP is against reservation. In Bengal and Karnataka there are 24% dalits per state. Whole BJP victory in WB, Karnataka, Orissa was possible because of dalits. More dalits voted for NDA than UPA.



You should have taken advice from some social science professor before writing this. It'd be really helpful if you added in links in your post. 

Also, kudos to taking the effort to trying to make a change. Atleast, you haven't given up like me ✌️ How naive to assume that the social, economic, and political inequality is not due to caste and just by providing jobs every issue will be solved. This is the problem of this sort of liberal, we all are equal, agenda, it presumes that opportunities are equally available for all. Whereas it overlook the fact that how Dalits and Adivasis are still discriminated and killed for even attaining some kind of social mobility. props to people who read the entire thing👏

It would be nice to add a tl;dr in the end tho🤠 You will certainly have support from Enlightened youth who are of small proportion.But Its gonna take decades for good amount of common people to support and follow your party, Like you mentioned it's gonna take a long time. But I hope you progress swiftly. Humanist? Yeh kaun jaat hai? What is your take on illegal immigration from Bangladesh ? Maybe a TL;DR at the beginning to give readers a vague idea about what's followed. What's your take on Christian missionaries and Islamic extremism? Our philosophy is to leave the existing reservation system untouched - you lost me on that one. 

If the reservation systen has not changed anything in 70 years, why should it stay on?

Why should we have a system where merit is not the primary criteria and group after ethnic group agitates to name themselves as backward - Jats and Marathas? Not calling yourself an atheist organisation is fine and dandy because we know how scary that word is to the uneducated, but trying to exclude ""secular"" doesnt make sense. Most of the policies your organisation supposedly stands for I can get behind, so I still want to see where this goes. Good luck. If you mean Hindutva as a religion, then definitely yes. But Hindutva as our culture/race can't be removed from us. Because that is what we are. Everyone can practice any religion or adopt a newer one, but the race is not a matter of choice. BJP is totally losing it by mixing Hindutva as a religion and Hindutva/Bharatiya as a race. You taken a look at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanist_Party_India ? If you are against affirmative action and reservation then that is terrible. Shows that you have put zero thought into your policies and are just rambling. This is not going anywhere. Atrocities against dalits are increasing and your solution is to take away the one helpful ladder they have? Won't lie, I am from right wing but I'll defect if you abolish reservation. You have my vote. Are you have an AMA . Fat Chance. You will not come to power even in 1000 years as your ideas needs people with good reasoning skills - asking questions was never encouraged in India. Yawn ! 😪 I consider myself humanist. I see few fundamental issues which I figured through lot of introspection. These seem straightforward but no one follows these:

i) Do not give freedom of speech to a group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of speech

ii) Do not give freedom of religion to group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of religion

iii) Do not give property rights to group/person who campaigns to abolish property rights 

iv) Do not give human rights to persons who work against human rights.

and so on.

Criticism welcome. This naturally eliminates commies, jihadis, anti fos activists, criminals etc. and yet is 'humanist' in nature.

Logic is systems should have survival instincts else they die, however noble they may be. It this gonna be a face for new BJP .",2019-05-27 19:36:02
Policy/Economy,"Manifesto - of the people, by the people, for the people",8,e70sav,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e70sav/manifesto_of_the_people_by_the_people_for_the/,1,"Every election I see all political parties propose their manifestos - the things they plan to implement. These manifestos are mostly made by the respective parties in consultation with their party heads, which as everyone knows are filthy rich people, and who are most often disillusioned by the pains of the poor and masses. Hence, I do not understand why they fight an election on (false) promises they find suitable to make to us.

Instead, they should ask the common man, what to implement and what not to. But since that is not going to happen IMO, we should instead make a manifesto and ask them to fulfil our needs.

I have prepared a mini-manifesto by myself. I am a middle-middle class guy, so I may not be correct about the needs of some other classes like BPL, Lower-middle class or Upper-middle class. I may have also missed on some points and may have written less on some particular topic, kindly excuse as this is done by a single person only.

I have not written much in detail, specifically about Jobs and Economy as I am yet learning more about these fields. But IMO the points I have already mentioned will help in bettering both somehow.

Also, it may seem to some that I have proposed establishing/purchasing a lot of things, and it may seem like a drain on the economy. But IMO those are some basic necessities for the much-touted Super Power, which itself is a welfare state, to begin with.

One more thing I want to address is that I staunchly believe in HIGHER TAXES for Billionaires and Millionaires. As Bernie Sanders says, ""Billionaires should NOT exist"" when half of the population finds it hard to put two fulfilling meals on the table.

Further commenting on above, I believe all natural resources on earth belong equally to each human, and not only to the ones 'privileged' enough to reap monetary gains out of it. I think no one will disagree that a Billionaire doesn't work more than an employee of his/her company. He/she just happened to make money by making others work for him.

And from the little economics I have read, even these rich people need poor, middle-class people to buy their stuff. If the current trend continues, poor will not be able to afford their products which will eventually end up lowering these billionaires wealth. And all the people advocating for Capitalism, kindly look at the USA. Capitalism has sucked it hollow. Millions do not have homes, they sleep in their cars. They survive on food stamps and pay $2500 to deliver a baby. Student debt is at an all-time high. Rich are getting richer, true but for how long you should ask.

Or 

Use MBA... do some financial planning...  

Please suggest other such options.

27M, single. 
 B. Tech (SRM, Chennai), MBA (BIM, Trichy) -> once among top 25 MBA institutes in the country. 

Working with an international bank.. about 11LPA salary. 

Savings would be about 5-6L. 

I just want to quit corporate world. I hate everything there. I feel I don't fit in there. 

Also have mental health issues diagnosed with Borderline, depression and a few others. Under therapy.. but it's long term. 
Have tinnitus ... Which kind of keeps me irritated a lot. 


I really want to quit everything.. go on a solo trip all over India... Just be by myself... And read.. completed first year MA philosophy, have over 100 books that I am yet to read.. want to read more... Both fiction as well as academic. Intrested in fields like history, philosophy, economy, public policy, psychology etc. 

May be write about things I learn.. 

But I need money too.. 
Let's say I rely on my parents for feeding me... And we have house so rental income can give me 3x food. 

But I need to make some money.
For starters therapy needs money. 
Travel will need money.. at least some money. 

I am trying to paint.. And that needs money. 

How do I make money?

Was thinking of doing B Sc Psychology and M Sc etc and getting into practice. So I can handle counseling sessions... 
That could a source of income. 


I don't know how much it will help in India... What else can I do?! 

With Borderline it's really getting difficult with relationshipz.. I don't think am ready for a relationship and I am not doing to get married with so much instability in my life...  Let's just think about me a person. 

I want to earn something at my pace to meet my needs. What are my options. 

Am MBA in finance, was also thinking of becoming a fee only financial advisor (aasan ideas for weaken FB group..) I actually do financial advice etc for friends and colleagues. 

Am not dumb.. I have cleared CAT.. I can teach kids for that.. take tuition... 

Am really confused :( what should I do? 

I hate everything... 

Sorry for the rant",sum1spcl," Well you sound like you desperately need a vacation to get your head sorted. Try to take 2 weeks off before quitting to come up with atleast a small plan to see what you want to do? That’s the only suggestion that I can give. So, I'll tell you how it all works out. 
I am no MBA neither am I some IIT. But I quit my decent paying job, moved back home first and eventually phased out of my job.

I just get about 10k coz in my free time I help dad manage some shit.

I was actively working on starting something of my own been about 40 months and nothing has yet worked out. I read a lot but that too has fizzled out coz now I am bored of books or frustrated in general and now I am more focused to getting back to earning.

I want to travel but that hasn't worked great 10k a month is insufficient for the entire month. 
So I went for a trek to Utharakhand. I paid 4500 in flight tickets to Delhi, train was about 900 I guess and 3500 for the trip. Stay was with friends and food was taken care. So saved there.

I planned a Hampi trip, it's supposed to be a cheap vacation from the place I live. But then j have other important expenses, like my health Insurance. I didn't have it until last year and then I got admitted into a hospital for 3 days and ended up paying more than a lakh.

My mom's root canal cost me 12k, You'll have to ensure your teeth are proper. Those buggers are a money sink.

You getting the idea?

Assuming you living in your home town. Now let's see you'll have friends and they'll surely want you to chill with them, they will be earning - once in a while you will have to go out with them, obviously don't want to end up alone coz you pinch money. One outing will set you back about 2k if you drink in my city. 

These are expenses and lifestyle you don't imagine and I considered it easy.

Do not. You have expenses, you have bills. You need a good passive income to sail you through. 
Again it'll be a call you'll have to take, lifestyle same rakhna hai ya scale down karna hai. 

For a similar lifestyle - I need about 15k a month to survive. But this is no savings. This is bills, travel and basic comfort.

Oh ya, your parents are getting old, so those expenses are something you need to keep in mind too. Even if they have saved some for themselves, as an Indian I am assuming, you'll be there and take responsibility.

What's the trade you need to make and how far can you go with a discipline? > DAE want to not work in a soul sucking job and just chill out and do things you enjoy?

That's what 90% of humanity dreams of bro Don't quit without a plan.

The least you can do is calculate how far your savings will last you, should you quit. After that, make a detailed plan on how to stretch your savings. Finally, as someone else commented, try picking up some freelance work on the internet or IRL to set up a network/fallback. If you can't find freelance work, it probably means you'll have to live solely on your savings...

Oh, and be absolutely sure that you can land a job again after a sabbatical - most industries choose to hire young 'uns because they are cheap and abundant. So, pretty soon you might find yourself too old or too expensive or both. You may not want to go back to a job but if things don't go right, you might just need to, so make sure that avenue remains open.

Source: Currently on a sabbatical. This is how I did it. I did it out of the blue in 2006. I just wanted to do my own thing. Had no idea what to do. Job is not something you are supposed to enjoy. That's why you get paid for doing it. If it was something you enjoyed, you would be paying to do it. You do your job from Monday to Friday, make money & then use that money to pursue your hobbies (read/write/travel) during weekends, holidays and vacations. 

There is a lot of stuff between like & hate. So try to get a job you don't hate (you don't necessarily need to love it) & use the money to pursue your hobbies. You should generate some passive income, start an online business. Selling products on Amazon. If you can do an investment of 50k and buy products from Suppliers, like Alibaba, etc, you might generate a passive income. You can do a research on that topic. Options are unlimited you just have to find them. Travelling takes toll on one's body also it isn't as galmours or enjoyable as people make it seems. A man without a plan won't survive much would not recommend. I was in your place a few years ago. A little older, lesser LPA, more in bank. Headed north and stayed with a friend, planned to head further north to volunteer. Friend convinced me that was not what I wanted, plus had an epiphany over more rounds of beers than usual. Dropped the plan, got back in the grind, realized it is not time to give up just yet.

If the anecdote avove doesn't help, get and read the book Vagabonding by Rolf Potts. While I would've loved a life on the road, that life without purpose would have bored the fuck out of me in months, in not years. God, things would have been different, worlds apart even, but I'm happy and content now. To be frank, almost everyone hates their job and want to leave it and instead travel and enjoy their life, but only a few are able to do so due to various factors. 

I agree with the top comment. First take two weeks leave and then plan how you want to do it. 

For the money part, how much have you saved till now? Do you have any loans? Better invest your savings in 1)Gilt funds and 2) Overnight funds to get better returns than FD and Savings account respectively. As most people have suggested, take a shorter break and figure out what you’d like to do. Quitting before figuring out may backfire and you might end up in a worse place. 

What if you don’t like traveling after a few months? What if you don’t like psychology a few months after you start your education ? I’d suggest taking time off and volunteering/ shadowing or working part time in a field you like and testing the waters before making the leap. 

Also it might just be that you need to switch jobs in your industry and choose something more laid back, rather make a drastic change. Remember the grass always seems greener on the other side. Just take smaller steps to figure out things. Good luck. Tinnitus can make You feel like You have mental Health Problems.
But there's a cure for that.
When your tinnitus is gone, you will be thinking more clearly.
As you have already mentioned, your state is not the one to make a decision this big.
I would suggest you to just go on a medical leave for some time. Travel. Get best medical care for your tinnitus.
Once its cured and you have clarity, only then think about resigning. Do it. Leave the job. Listen to your heart. In my opinion, maybe you should take a break, like go hiking or enjoy a vacation and so on. Leave those works or making money stuff behind.

Policy/Economy,Modi's war against Environment of India,269,b5b2av,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b5b2av/modis_war_against_environment_of_india/,50,"This post is a compilation of all instances where Modi govt tried to destroy India's environment and ecology, either by changing laws systematically or by allowing disastrous projects in eco-sensitive zone. 

-	In 2014, Modi govt allowed mid-sized polluting industries to operate within five km of eco-sensitive areas like national parks and sanctuaries. Earlier this limit was 10 km. (https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/nda-government-further-eases-environment-clearances-for-projects-45664)

Feel free to add something or update some point here.",dhruvrathee," > In Goa, they classified Coconut Tree as a grass ...

Excuse me Goa, what the f*ck! That's a very good comprehensive list.

It's unbelievable how the bjp is literally selling our country's future away for momentary short-term gain.

 This is excellent work.  What's the solution? From the people on the ground to the policymakers at the top no one wants to do the right thing.

Farmers grow the most water-intensive crops like sugarcane even in the most acute drought and then end up going into debt and committing suicide.

Politicians and government officials at every level pilfer money meant for irrigation projects and then suggest that they can piss in our dams if the farmers want.

Nobody from common home owners to municipal corporations wants to seriously consider simple steps like water conservation, rainwater harvesting and wastewater recycling.

The solutions are obvious and plenty. But our mindset is such that they'll never be adopted.

Policy/Economy,Did I do the right thing (for myself) by rejecting an offer from a company? Or have I been a dick?,14,cnxe9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cnxe9o/did_i_do_the_right_thing_for_myself_by_rejecting/,8,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I have been out of work for the last three months and after a long time I recently got an offer after the usual push/pull formalities of the hiring process. 

My take home salary in my previous company was 1.2 lacs PM with the CTC being 14 lacs annually. What this company offered me was 10 lacs annualy with the gross coming out to be 80k per month. Before the process started, the consultant told me upfront that the company's budget was 10 lacs annually and at the most they would be able to stretch that to 11.5 lacs annually. 

Since I had been out of work for quite some time, I decided to take the plunge anyway and take the pay cut. After having cleared all the rounds, I was sent the offer letter with the salary break up etc a day before the joining the company. 

Now as I went through the clauses, I noticed two clauses that made me a bit hesitant. 

1. That I would have to return them the joining bonus of 50K if I leave the company before one year. I was to receive the joining bonus after having served 3 months in the company. 

2. That the notice period in the company was 60 days (2 months). 

I couldn't agree with these and I called the HR for clarification. Now this was a day BEFORE I was to join the company and around 7PM. 

1. The HR clarified that if I leave within the first 3 months I wouldn't have to pay it. Now who leaves a company after joining a company within three months?

2. The HR said that this is company policy and there was nothing the he/she could do about it. 

With two other interviews lined up, I decided to not join the company. Though I have a 50/50 chance of getting through the other companies, I however decided it was too risky to join this company. Esp. the two month notice period. 

So /r/india, did I do the right thing? Or did I take too much of a chance. It's been in my head for the last week so just thought I would share it, let it out, and hear your thoughts on this one. 

What would you have done? Should I have just taken the job since I was 'at least' going to get a salary and some money? Also, the consultant calling calling me back, hearing things like I shouldn't have rejected the offer in this economy was too much to hear.",rejectedanoffer," Both the clauses are standard clauses. I don't know what fly-by-night firm you were working for earlier that did not have a notice period and where your in-hand salary is more than your CTC.

&#x200B;

> The HR clarified that if I leave within the first 3 months I wouldn't have to pay it. Now who leaves a company after joining a company within three months? 

&#x200B;

Because those 3 months are most probably your probation period. You can leave or the company can ask you to leave during this, usually with a 15 day notice period. Again, a standard clause. ""My take home salary in previous company was 1.2 lacs PM with CTC being 14 lacs annually""

With tax saving skills like that, you don't need a job bro. Just consult people and make crores every year!!

Anyway, on a serious note the policies were fine. The joining bonus is mostly standard practice since they expect you to at least stay for a year. 

And notice period is also pretty normal since you'd need to finish your projects and hand over work and knowledge transfer. If you complete these before 2 months, you can just go to office and warm the seats (and get paid for it). The company itself will let you go early in that case. You did what you had to. Stop thinking about it and move on. Ideally you should have said yes to them and asked for a joining date couple of weeks away so you could get through the other interviews. If you get through the other interview tell this company you found a better offer and wont be joining. Some people would not like it but there is nothing wrong with it. It is pure negotiation and keeping a backup is a a good idea. Trust me companies will not keep you for even a day extra when they don’t need you. Op you did right thing",2019-08-09 12:36:53

Just wait for bhakts to label him as a double agent  This will piss off all the right people in both the countries. Man, British are still looting our national treasury.xd

Just this time we are giving it away intentionally. Ohohohoho this will burn right through the asshole of many fellow Indians 😂😂 To put this in perspective, consider that UK has to navigate Brexit. They actually know the importance of the post of governor of central bank.You cant let politics dictate the appointment of such critical posts.Or even appoint a parrot to that post.The very minute changes in central bank has far-reaching effects in the coming years.

People underestimate the power and influence of governor of the central bank in the economy.Since his policy changes don't produce immediate results(for the common man) and takes mostly 1-2 years to show any signs.

Some people think that lowering the interest rates are the only thing the RBI chief does and if he does only that, everything will be great. TIL that Raghuram Rajan's father, R Govindararajan was a spy. ITS A PLAN.

Now he will have full access to Vijay Mallya's bank accounts in London :) And we Indians like to crib about brain drain and how everyone talented works elsewhere. If you don't make use of great talent, someone else will. 

 It will be a big advantage for Bank of England if Raghram Rajan become head of their institution.A great economist,intelligent man our government discarded him and brought a puppet to run RBI,England taking second Kohinoor from India. Nice! [removed] Shobha de moves to London.  I'm happy for him, I'm sad for myself and India. I laugh at modiji when he says Pratibha Palayan.  Not a hope.

He would turn it down himself unless the political winds turned. Head of a sinking ship is a dumb role to take. He deserves this position but Indians do not deserve great economist.
Indian Politics SUCKS... He did not give a fuck to indian politicians.
CHEERS... Watch idiots of our country go on a rant about how he’s bowing to our colonial overlords and how he has no self respect as an Indian He was in the longlist for US fed chairman post too. Let's not kid ourselves here. The lists may be diverse, but most likely the post will be filled by a white man. As it was with the fed: Jerome Powell. He was intelligent and charismatic enough to capture the attention of people or youth especially who otherwise have zero interest in Indian bureaucracy or administration.


Govt should have desperately tried to hold onto him ,on the contrary they worked out of bounds to get rid of him. [removed] No big deal, we have intellectuals like Sambit Patra and Venkaiah Naidu.  Oh, this must hit the Hindutva brigand brigade hard.

I sincerely hope he wins it. And if he does, these guys will claim he is anti-national, not recognizing the fact that it is ironical.

 Knew this was Modi's plan all along.

/s He is the best at his job, as he says :

I'm Raghuram Rajan, and I do what I do. I hope he turns things around as he did with India Only person who must be feeling sad about this is Manmohan Singh, who personally requested, hand picked or whatever you call it, Mr.Rajan to be RBI's Governor. It's sad to know he may never return, but glad he is being recognized so well in a 1st world country. Good luck for the race, you logical Indian. Great news , now Indian economy will again see a depression . LOL This bugger needs to read that Bengal famine essay that gets posted on schedule on reddit. Brain drain 😂 Rajan did not want the extension. Ask someone who you might know from RBI / senior banking circle. 
 He was supposed to be running for American Federal Bank as well.I guess after this he will be in running for China Bank as well :).",2018-04-24 11:39:11

I see that there is an existing master thread on the Budget. I should have ideally posted this summary there. What is PIS and FPI? \> A TV channel for startups (to be designed by startups)

Let's hope it's just not another startup news channel, 'X startup secured Y funding' is useless for 99.9% of startups.

Where as UGC type startup channel which covers knowledge rather than information i.e. 'How to identify a problem, to solve with a startup', 'How to make money with a startup', 'How to improve capital efficiency' etc. would actually be useful. What's the tax slab for hybrid vehicles going to be? Still the retarded 28+cess?

Also if this is a provision in the budget and not a rate set by the GST council, is it constitutional? If it is, then wouldn't it then become a statutory provision that the GST council cannot amend? Who will prevail? Thanku for this.",2019-07-05 17:21:58
Policy/Economy,My take on Decline of Indian GDP Growth rate and current state of Economy.,3,dgsy6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dgsy6w/my_take_on_decline_of_indian_gdp_growth_rate_and/,1,"according to the world bank growth of Chinese Economy during most troublesome years of depression were double digit and even skyrocketed as we can see below.

Year : Chinese GR - Indian GR (for comparison)

2005: 11.4% - 9.3%

2006: 12.7% - 9.3%

2007 : 14.7% - 9.8%

2008: 9.7% - 3.9%

2009: 9.4% - 8.5%

2010: 10.6% - 10.3%

as we can see Chinese kept their double digit growth in the worst economic crisis of the 21th century while in today's world India cant even Manage the growth rate of 5%.  so this idea that Indian Economy is tanking because global recession is bull, its result of the disastrous economic policies adopted by the 2014-2018 Government.

at least under UPA government Economy bounced back and achieved even higher growth rate after 2008 but under NDA government our economy growth rate is under sharp decline, instead of capturing this once in century moment when western factories are leaving China in search of more affordable and friendly market, we are doing everything we can to destroy our economy.

imagine what will happen when this recession will become a depression in the future if one of the major bank in either India or Western World collapses as most of economists are predicting, i have a feeling that new generation will get his hardest as there are fewer jobs and more manpower (already) and with this slow growth there will be even fewer jobs available for the college graduates in near future, due to lack of experiences they will be first one to get booted if companies will start cost cutting. these depressed young educated class of people will either become a nationalistic bunch of people(Bhakts) or turn India into complete anarchy with revolution.

Policy/Economy,What happened to BSNL?,88,b2flpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b2flpy/what_happened_to_bsnl/,33,"I think BSNL was sabotaged internally for the profit of private companies.

* BSNL used to be a very good provider of telecom services in the country. I remember it was the first telecom company that came into our small town, it provided very good service for that time, it was relatively cheap and reliable. It was also the first 3g provider in our area.
* But somehow, quality of its services went downhill over the years,nowadays the network goes down in my area very frequently due to some fiber optic cut, or sometimes something gets stolen from the tower premises and nobody seems to care.
* Everybody in my town had at least one BSNL sim which they used, but after the disruptions everyone got frustrated and switched to other providers.
* At the time of 3g allotment, BSNL was forced to take the spectrum in all circles by matching highest bid price in that circle. I don't understand why couldn't the govt give the spectrum for free in the first place. After all it's a govt entity, and everybody must have known it would kill BSNL.
* The government didn't even allocate 4g spectrum to BSNL, it was like the final nail in the coffin.

Edit!

* Many of you are looking at BSNL as a separate non government for profit entity, which i don't, I see it as publicly owned utility which is an absolute must for our modern times, not just for remote or non profitable areas but for every location in the country.
* BSNL wasn't as bad as some may believe, it was definitely not up to the mark like Airtel, but it wasn't as bad for that time, we never had network outage of any kind, and was cheap too. It went from average to worse in the last decade only.
* The argument that free spectrum for BSNL may seem unfair for private companies, i would have accepted that if we had a truly free market economy, we never had one, free market in our country only exists for a very few oligarchs, it is used by the govt at its whim.
* I will give you an example, take the case of India Post, it's a PSU and a very well functioning PSU, should we have charged some license fee for it to operate? We have a perfectly good model how shipping and courier companies work in India, they work just fine alongside IndiaPost. Unlike the IndiaPost's case, telecom spectrum is a limited resource so we need a barrier for the entry, but private companies should have survived that too by limiting the amount of services BSNL can provide.
* Also, BSNL wasn't in any sort of bad shape before the 3g spectrum drama, it wasn't in debt, it had huge reserves, to the tunes of 35000 crore which the govt forcibly took from it as a licence fee. All the policies regarding 3g spectrum allocation wreaked havoc on the telecom industry, BSNL drowned in debt not because of being a PSU but because of incompetent governments and its policies like most other private telecom companies.
* BSNL management didn't live in a vacuum, they perfectly knew 4g was coming and they were not slow or incompetent they were sabotaged internally to act like this.
* It's not just Modi, both the BJP and Congress are complicit

While i was never a fan of BSNL's services and the way it tried to compete with private players, I believe it is extremely important to tier 2/3/lower towns and villages as the sole connectivity provider. Also BSNL in losses is not a bad thing as long as it is reaching places which are not economically viable for private players. 

I think a lot of fucked up foresight and planning has led us to a place where BSNL needs way too much money to keep afloat, something that every govt is short of. 

 I still use BSNL. 

yes. Even in the days where Jio is like the king of data, I still like to use BSNL. Not because it charges high, or something like that. But to help it survive. And I feel it is the sole connectivity provider in remote areas and some of the northern frontiers even today. At remote areas like Munsyari, Dharchula, Pithoragarh, Tanakpur (Uttarakhand), BSNL still reigns over Jio. Got full network in these areas and even on mountainous terrains and roads.

&#x200B;

Red-tapism killed such an amazing organization.  It's going the same route as AI. All profitable sectors are auctioned to the highest bidder/cronies and state owned providers are stuck with non profitable sectors. BSNL still has one of the widest coverage, in areas nobody else could operate profitably. This comes at a high cost but the value provided is also high, not in monetary terms but in connectivity to remote areas.  From now on, when someone says Private Companies, they mean one/many of {reliance of big bro, reliance of small bro, adani, or some gujarati fraud company}  also, they were sabotaged by staff unions to avoid disinvestment. only profit-making companies shall be IPO'ed .  They won't let it die and they won't let it live. Doesnt matter what you see it as. It is a for profit entity listed on exchanges and must follow the law as any entity. Giving preference to BSNL would be unfair to other private companies. It would discourage foreign investments in all sectors if this is the attitude displayed by the govt. Worse even existing foreign players would drag India to dispute in WTO.

Not just that, this type of behavior is detrimental for the transfer of knowledge and job creation. I remember the days when BSNL was so damn expensive. Glad we opened up to private sector and now the calls and data both are dirt cheap. Third, also a big PSU like BSNL is a hotpot for corruption. Private companies do the job just as efficiently and fairly. Yes, they have no incentive to expand to remote areas, but this is also industry that changes very rapidly from 2G, 3G, to 4G to now 5G. There needs to be a constant stream of investments, infrastructure upgradations, and network managment - All of which is probably not efficiently possible for a PSU.

Also private players succeed well because they have better boards, leadership teams, promoters with deep pockets playing the long game. They are faster to change and more adaptive to changing customer behaviors.

Your argument that BSNL is an utility and it makes sense to keep it running, and yes I do agree with that. However, this should be done by infusing more money by govt, not by twisting rules to work in its favor. But, where is the govt gonna get the money from? Also, India is a developing country and there is much better ROI by using that money for infrastructure / job growth rather than subsidizing a bloated / inefficient PSU.  Bsnl will make a comeback, I think so.  Red tapesim, favouring privatisation, crippling BSNL etc etc... They've been played real bad, a lot of forced delays to help competitors.

> Many of you are looking at BSNL as a separate non government for profit entity, which i don't, I see it as publicly owned utility which is an absolute must for our modern times, not just for remote or non profitable areas but for every location in the country.    

Thank you for stating this!    

A psu does things in interest of the public to serve the public. A private enterprise does a public service/move to serve its own interest. Privatization is also not a guarantee of great services.     
I just hope consumers keep in mind that even if they like private service, it wont fight for them unless it affects their bottom line. Support the greater good cause and support your fav private convenience provider as well.     

As always - bsnl lao desh bachao    

 Idk what you're talking about.

Installed BSNL giga fibre in my house last week. It's cheap and amazing. I always have a ping below 20 and both up and down speeds are around 48Mbps(8MBps). Sabotaged by the govt so it gets devalued and some private company buys it for a pittance and voila said private company has massive coverage and raises prices cuz it becomes a monopoly/duopoly. 

India has just 3-4 telecom providers now. Jio, Airtel, Vodafone/idea and bsnl. What happens when there are few competing companies, all 3 collude to jack up prices. 

Look at America’s telecom industry. We are heading there as we speak. AT&T, T mobile and sprint. Prices are exhorbitant and services are crap.  Their customer service is the worst  my 3g network was out for a whole week and they didn't even extended my plan by that time which is lost due to their incompetence. Their employees doesn't care about customers cause they get their salary either way at least that's the situation here. Call 1503 wait for 2 hrs to talk to a customer service agent what a joke. But there is also a positive side about bsnl they were the only provider who was online during the flood. ",2019-03-18 15:15:29

As per [**news reports** ](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/trai-to-meet-telcos-officials-to-discuss-issues-for-deliberation-in-2019-118112701007_1.html)India’s telecom regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) likes to do it as well. It has started a process for setting its priorities for 2019 and is meeting telecom companies. We believe that such planning is good, and it can be better if they heard from internet users as well.

Yesterday, to put this request across formally we wrote [**a letter to the TRAI**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ftvbwFjL1K5ALB5M723Wv6JJuIWWNmFE/view?usp=sharing). We are asking them to invite a greater diversity of views beyond telecom companies in private meetings. This must include internet users. We are seeking to crowdsource complaints, wishes and requests and substantiating them with our policy expertise and taking them to the TRAI.

**Tell us what issues bother you?**

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:**  (1) We have sent a reminder to TRAI today again asking them for a meeting. We are going to keep following this up. (2) We are creating an excel sheet to collate responses across Reddit, Twitter and Email. (3) While we have tried to reply to each comment, we have limited staff and are now spending time to look at how we can link your issues to actionable policy based submissions.   


Finally, thank you. The Reddit community has shown us much love through participation and engagement. We appreciate that deeply, thank you! We promise to keep engaging and bridging the gap between the public and public policy. ",InternetFreedomIn," 1. **Simplify recharge plans**

My ideal interaction with provider would be to throw annual payment their way and forget they exist for a year.

I'd really like simple pay-and-forget-for-a-long-time plans. Mainly to receive calls and occasionally make them.

Data is totally *unimportant* to me. I'm ready to pay for such an annual subscription, but they come up with all these complicated recharge plans where there are all kinds of voice+data tradeoffs, and weird validity restrictions. They are complicating decision making for no benefit to me. It's even more complicated for people like my parents who are unable to remember things like these. It's like aadhar all over again.

Simply put, I'd like them to offer simple idiotproof plans for idiots like me and my family. Take our money, and give us voice calls and SMSes for a year.

&#x200B;

2. **Handling 2G/3G retirement**

Recently, in August, I had a very bad experience with my provider.

I got an SMS out of the blue from provider on a Sunday afternoon - a day when their own customer offices are closed - that I *have* to get my SIM changed from a 2G to 4G compatible one by next morning 9AM.

The next morning they just shut off my service, just like that!

I had to disrupt my work plans to facilitate *their* stupid administrative work, surrender my aadhar details to them to get their new SIM, faced problems with fingerprint biometrics (4 fingers didn't match, luckily my middle finger did. Yes, they asked for my middle finger and I gave them my middle finger, literally and figuratively), and then, worst of all, they took 48 hours to activate SMSes or calls on that new SIM - apparently, that's some kind of security feature to prevent phishing.

My mobile is my emergency as well as business device. 2 days offline as their official planned migration procedure with little advance warnings was not a good feeling, and was very customer hostile.

&#x200B;

Now there's news that they plan to forcefully retire 2G and 3G altogether in the next year or so, and allow only 4G capable mobiles. I have no doubt they'll botch up that too.

I'd like TRAI to review their decisions about this forceful retirement. If it's absolutely necessary, then I'd like TRAI to make provider come up with a properly planned procedure with minimum disruption and advance warning to customers . 1 hour I can understand, but 2 days forced offline is ridiculous.

&#x200B;

Edit: 1 more point

**3. Emergency addressal of service issues**

Thanks to the government's own policies which require mobile service for everything from OTPs for aadhar to banking, a mobile cannot be treated like any another service. Things like mobile number phishing or service stoppage can result in grave personal / financial consequences to a user. It can't be left to customers to coordinate between private company customer service and police, who all follow their own adhoc timelines. It requires some kind of neutral ombudsman who can address issues in emergencies and have jurisdiction to direct actions at the telco operator level if required. Any compensation issues can be addressed later, just like it happens in healthcare emergencies.

&#x200B; A month = 28 days? BSNL is doing random ad injection and page redirection. I have noscript browser extension installed on firefox. From time to time sites I visit get content from BSNL IP addresses. Multiple posts have been made on r/india about complaining to local bsnl offices, but I guess these kind of decisions to redirect traffic are made way up the mgmt food chain that local frontline BSNL managers cant do anything about.

If BSNL is allowed to do it, whats preventing Reliance Jio from redirecting any commercial request to their businesses? Unnecessary spam in form of ads, calls, messages as well as emails by jio. I recharge my plan I know what plan I'm taking I don't need 3 calls, 5 messages and even more emails to tell me what it is for. Plus the imminent spam of everything that begins just a week prior to expiry of the plan. I'm bombarded with calls, sms, emails and worst of all, the myjio app inserting full page banner ads everywhere in the system as they please, telling me to recharge. I block a number and I get call from another number, but never again from same one(I've set to notify if blocked number calls), this is even more fishy, how do you know I blocked your number? And biggest of all, how many numbers do you have to just spam your customers? This needs to be regulated strictly as well. 1. A plan should not be called unlimited if there is FUP
2. Do away with 28-day plans. Plans less than 30 days should be allowed to exist only if a similar 30-day option is given. 28 days = 13 billing cycles per year and we're not stupid. 
3. Content Blocking: Ideally there should be no content blocking. But if there has to be, then TRAI or the DoT should maintain a public database of hosts/ips/URLs that are blocked. 
4. Pay-and forget unlimited plans - take my money and make yourself scarce. There should be simple annual unlimited voice, SMS, and data plans where one can just pay annually and not think about it again. 
5. Regulate logging by ISPs
6. DNS over TLS service must be provided as an option to all subscribers.
7. Fast track escalation/resolution of DND violation complaints. Stricter action against telemarketers who violate people's DND preferences.  With respect to Broadband. Trai in **2006** had set *guidelines*for internet speeds. The ISP had to guarantee **80%** of the speed till the last node.

This was back in copper wire dial up days.

Now with fiber optics, the tolerance could be reduced. Say 95% of the speed guaranteed.

Also traffic shaping should be stopped or made public before buying a connection.

Fair usage policy should be done away with, unlimited plans should be truly unlimited. Given now there's Fiber to home connection, we are no longer *taking away others network* which was the original argument for FUP. Corporations who buy bulk phone numbers to sell stuff... Please regulate that.

&#x200B;

While buying something from a store where they ask for my phone number, I would really prefer my phone number not being sold to any other company.

I end up receiving calls from companies trying to sell me properties in my city, insurance, and all other crap.

PLEASE MAKE MORE STRICT RULES FOR CORPORATIONS TO COLLECT MOBILE NUMBER. What we really do need is more information from our ISPs. A lot of ISPs ,especially in smaller towns, throttle internet speeds at varying times in the day to save their own costs, go below the plan that they have given out and people generally don't complain because they've sort of grown up knowing ""Internet band ho gaya""

I don't have a solution. Perhaps better auditing of ISPs in smaller towns would help this. We don't have fiber or good internet and the local ISPs can basically take full advantage of that 30,61,92,185,366 days plans.  

No requirement of having to recharge the number compulsorily. 

Plans for only voice.

Plans for only data. And volte. 

Stop using SMS for ads.  I don't think anyone reads them. It's just nuisance. Easy options to review and report violations of DND. And punishments for those sub selling their databases for SMS dumps. 

 Blocking torrent websites. I don't understand the point of blocking a p2p network. Its not all for piracy.  PORN BAN Stop with 28 days(and multiples 56 days, 84 days so on) recharge plans. How hard is it for these telecom operators to provide a month long (30 days) recharge plan instead of milking one extra month of recharge from customers. Airtel blocked incoming calls to my phone after my plan expired. I understand outgoing but incoming!! .I've been a loyal customer to Airtel for the past 6 years and I've paid them who knows how much money and yet they do this douchebaggery! Pathetic. Also they want to charge us a minimum amount per month to keep using their sim? That's absurd! The 'unlimited validity' issue tops it all for me.  Airtel reduced validity of my pack. If they are gonna introduce some changes to the validity-system, then it should be done after the current pack expires. They forcefully reduced the validity (which I think is not legal?) and asked to recharge with 23 rs or smart packs to get 28 days validity.

Also there are no long term validity plans. Its simply annoying to do 23rs every month. My suggestion would be to not ban the internet of the whole city just for a fucking government exam, did I mention the government exam is a very low level. Its almost impossible to reach the customer care in Airtel. There is a long message indicating how much balance I have left and my validity that takes 2 minutes of the call.

Once that is done, i have options to avail advanced talktime, check previous payments, pay previous advance talktime dues, stop autocredit of talk time but there is nothing that will help me know why my incoming calls are banned even after the minimum recharge.

Also, I got notified of the minimum recharge thing only 12 hours before the expiry. There was no notification on either MyAirtel app or SMS before that. 1. Not every month is February. Away with 28 days.

2. Minimum recharge loot. It's unbelievable that we have to keep paying every month to keep the phone numbers that we have had for years or decades with God knows how much money spend on them. 
Do note that Vodafone customer care explicitly state that their hands are tied and they are only doing this because of TRAI's explicit orders(you can test this, ask them why this change). Which is bullshit, because companies put forward this to TRAI. Anyway falsefied information. 

Not to mention that the companies actually gain revenue from incoming calls in form of termination charges. But nah! They just wanna loot the customers. 


3. Stop banning stuffs. It's simply against the freedom. 

4. Take actions so as to not let telecom sector become a monopoly.

5. Make it so that the companies are forced to provide an option to talk directly to a representative rather than going through tonnes of menus on their customer care.

6. Ads and spam calls, DND doesn't really work as I still get bombarded with shitty smses and calls. Get this right.
 I have several concerns. 

1) Why is so much content blocked? I can't even visit sport sites like Bleacher Report.


2) Like so many people have already said, a billing cycle should be of 30/31 days.


3) No FUPs on unlimited plans.


4) Basic speed of Broadband should be higher. Why are we still stuck with 512 KBps? 


5) QoS control. Like an acceptable rate of speed for most of the time in a day.


6) Interference of Govt. with Internet services. 


7) Stopping shady practices by Vodafone etc. In unlimited 
plans, if at the end of day I have a significant amount of data left, my speeds are throttled to the point that I can't even open a webpage. And then magically, I have my speeds restored after the data for that day lapses. One month should be of 30 days and not 28 days.
u/InternetFreedomIn Never allow contracts for mobile plans! People in countries such as Australia suffer so much by this! Like getting in 12 months contract and if they want to change plan then you have to pay all the remaining months.  Even after spending good amount for their plans, I don't get promised speeds. Not even close to promised speeds. Even worse I get only 2G signal while the network's official website says ""this area has 4G VOLTE coverage"". So I want a fool-proof ""system"" to keep this in check. (May be download an app from TRAI which tests the speed or signal coverage and automatically reports it). Some things I would like to be heard - 

1. DND is not very effective. Even after reporting a DND, the errant marketer will say it is a service call and the complaint is closed. No one digs deeper. It is painfully obvious that this is just for eyewash.
2. Data speed - The actual speeds we get do not really match up to 4G and lag behind. Sometimes there is no data. We need some quality control here.
3. Tariffs - Telecos don't tell you when they have a new plan with a lower subscription price for your current subscription. They do not declare it on the website also and if it is it comes with fine print (an oxymoron since it is not mentioned at all). I hate the minimum recharge shit these cartels are bringing. It must be our choice tp recharge how much we want whenever. Get this rescinded. A number by TRAI to block a specific annoying sms sender eg TM-MyGov or TM-anycompanyname. Let's say I want to block sms alert from TM-flipkart completely then I will send ""STOP TM-flipkart"" to some TRAI number ;)

Cheap plans only for validity just like Bsnl no need to care about expiry :) I don't use data at all (50 rs recharge in my Jio Phone which also goes waste and normal SIM in my android ) 

Jio customer service (I don't know if it's right to complain here) but they are ill trained like so so bad. I can send you email screenshot anytime :) Issue is they are very very bad at resolving an issue, their reply on email will be about how great their service is and how helpful their app is (dude I checked your app and faq and then I bothered to mail else I would have called if it's little issue) Their call service Guy takes very long to get on point ;_; and no matter how detail mail I write, someone who can't comprehend it will receive it and will never bother to forward request to the one who actually understand issue and guess what if your issue don't get resolved on same day, they don't create a ticket and you need to follow up with New person again -_- I really hate them when they copy paste stuff and rarely get on point. Cutting internet access at times of protests (Like how it happened in case of Tuticorin sterlite ban) doesn't do justice to democracy and safety. Cutting internet for the sake of government entrance exams is also preposterous. TRAI should stand against these practices. I am sure much better alternate methods can be devised. One vexing issue that I wanted to highlight is the continued and forced separation of VoIP and PSTN traffic. Call routing is not allowed between these two worlds and it is stifling Indian development in unified voice communication services. Case in point, Indian is one of the few countries where you cannot buy Office 365 Dial-in conferencing - because once a VoIP packet originates anywhere in the world, it cannot terminate on a mobile or terrestrial voice network in India, by law. 

The technology and applications (with associated billing and security measures) are available today - but we are stuck between gigantic oligarchs whose attention is anywhere but evolving newer competitive voice communication models. That is why we are home to a unique service industry around enabling 'logical partitioning' - which is nothing but feature suppression on modern PBXes that are designed to break down traditional VoIP / PSTN barriers.  Allow IP telephony from across all platforms. Give preference to people of India against corporate companies when it comes to TRAI policies and benefits..  I know it's already been said and trai has called them out for it, but I want to chime and say that forcing a recharge for availing services is thuggery and the evil trifecta ( Airtel Vodafone and idea ) need to be stopped from looting. I can understand that they are going through dips in profit but to charge an existing user a monthly fee of sorts just for having the number exist is preposterous. Why do they need to charge us for incoming calls when they already charge the network provider of whoever is calling ? Jio is blocking most of the websites. Their customer care execs told me that this is done based on government order. Interestingly, even government websites are inaccessible. How come there is such a grey area or a lack transparency? Straightforward way to report credit card scammers! u/lokqq already mentioned this about this about BSNL. But I would like to inform something about MTNL.  
MTNL injects advertisements through ip on non-https pages also just like BSNL. Their own official site mtnlmumbai.in is non-https. Their broadband service is so horrible that I have to call them every month (sometimes every week) because their broadband connection keeps resetting itself because their wires keep getting moisture (literally what the repairman said). MTNL keeps advertising about FTTH a lot where I live, but when it comes to providing it, its non-existent.(MTNL telephone exchange center is less than 1km from where I live btw.)  

now that I am done with MTNL's broadband service, here are the issues with their ""3G prepaid"".    
I have a prepaid data plan of Rs.421 , to activate this plan, first I need to spend Rs.421 for plan and then need to spend Rs.20 for balance. If I don't have minimum balance, the Rs.421 plan doesn't activate despite the payment going through, so why do I need to spend more money? other providers like Jio don't have this kind of requirement.  
The plan includes unlimited free calls, but for some reason If I call toll-free numbers of Banks (SBI/ICICI etc.), the money is cut off from balance. And as I said before, if there is no minimum balance in account, the data plan I paid Rs.421 for deactivates till I spend more money to recharge the balance.  
Sometimes when I call with MTNL, I get echo of my own voice, this also happened when I called their service center.   
Just like their broadband service, their data service also keeps disconnecting despite having full network.  
I have passed these complaints to MTNL service center by call, but haven't got any followup call or solution.
 Is it possible to ban ads like these: [https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9oafiv/how\_do\_i\_block\_these\_kind\_of\_messages\_i\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9oafiv/how_do_i_block_these_kind_of_messages_i_have/)

&#x200B;

They are sent without a number, so we are not able to filter/block them as there is no number to block. Even apps like Truecaller are not able to block them. Cross ownership of media. TRAI came up with a Consultation paper, LCI did a panel discussion and then it fizzled out. 

Needed now more than ever.  Telecom companies often subscribe us to paid services that we don't need and we didn't opt for. That should be regulated. Yes More efficient 1909 blocking.

Many spam companies keep sending sms and even after reporting it to 1909, they won't stop it. In fact, they increase the spam towards that user.

1909 report says it's service message (i.e. having an account of that company) & **not block-able**, even though I'm not having any account or anything to do with that sender (i.e.  it's fucking SPAMMER).

I reported **more than 500 SPAM SMSs** maybe thousand(s) to 1909. But, hardly they blocked few of the spam.

And, now I don't get many necessary OTPs but get the SPAMs. As they blocked unreported service messages, but not the spams that I reported.

**& I've full DND enabled.** Why the hell nobody is talking about call drops, shitty call qualities and crappy network? Take money and give good network that's it! Please note down this issue and raise it during meetings.

Here is a hidden info what these telecoms do on network complaints. You put a complaint, there will register the complaint and assign someone for the visit from their RF team. The guy will come and note down the signal strength in and outside of your location and will give the feedback to the department who has nothing to do with but just to brush it off with different ways by putting remarks like tried to contact customer but not reachable or the area is best optimise for your location since due to geographical reasons we can't go beyond. You again raise the same concern they will close it with the same reason with more confidence such an assholes.

So in short you will never ever get a resolution for a network complaint. There was a time when complained at higher level to leading telecom, was asked to provide a space for renting a tower during their initiative called open network. It was all bloody sham!

Just remember we are paying them for the services they are offering, if the network is crappy then why are we paying the complete price? Nobody pays full for half! ISP using monopoly and providing slow internet speed (just 4mb/s in 2018) please block spam messages and calls Some thoughts that I have:  

1. TRAI should make seamless wifi handover mandatory(especially for voice/video calls) so that people and companies need not invest in setting up additional 4g/5g(future) radios in areas where people can use any network for data and Voice calls. Basically setup a system to allow telecom providers to piggyback(for the lack of a better term) off existing wireless networks in regions where they dont have network coverage.


2. I should be able to view what company/organization/government body has requested access or has accessed my Identification information such as AADHAAR, Pan, Driver's Licence(any and all unique ID's) with no exception. Should easily be able to identify which ID is linked to what services/accounts, etc throughtout the lifecycle of my existence and beyond.


3. To take it a step further, No company/organization, etc. should be able to access my personally identifiable information without express authentication by the user/owner. Maybe have  a portal/app that receives requests that does not provide the requested information, unless I explicitly allow that particular request for information to be shared.


4. Set up a more robust/fool-proof and secure method of getting a replacement SIM card so that nobody can just go to the telecom provider and get a new SIM card with your number. This will prevent a lot of the scams that rely on getting replacement sim card to bypass 2 factor authentication that is used by banks.
\n>

5. Set minimum broadband speeds to at least 8 Mbps(if not higher) for rural areas. Meaning whether FUP is reached or not, speeds should never be below that threshold.

6. Download and upload speeds for connections should be mentioned clearly in plans. Most ISP's provide <1/10th of plan speeds for upload. So if/when one has to upload a project file or a YouTube video, etc, it ends up taking more than 10x as long since upload speeds is less than 1/10th of download on most ISPs.

Here is a brief list to answer your question Mister Prime Minister:

1. For destroying India's economy via Demonetisation and not taking responsibility for the damage it has done.

2. For destroying the traditional plural culture of our ancient land via organised polarisation - not just religious, but also regional, linguistic and cultural.

3. For destroying the profound teachings of Hinduism/ Sanatan Dharma by placing Savarkar's fascist Hindutva as Hinduism.

4. For continuing the charade of fake nationalism when your deeds and policies are only harming India.

5. For being a government - not of India - but of Hindutva forces, crony corporations and foreign vested interests - especially the Zionist global banking cartel.

6. For false promises and falsehoods which are being spread through multiple channels everyday.

7. For violating the principles of the Indian Constitution by introducing theocratic militant nationalism and anti-privacy/ anti-freedom Aadhaar.

And you ask, what I have done to deserve this? Hahahahaha. Like always, Mudiji ne toh rhetoric question pucha tha. Launda serious ho gaya.  I still remember the height of his popularity in 2014, the man has come crashing down hard. With so much popularity and full numbers in the house, he would have easily assured another term if he had only surrounded himself who wasn't an ass-licker !! RIP Devdan Chaudhari. Either dead or arrested. 😰 Reading his 22 points made me realize that there are only more to add, nothing to reduce. Very well said. I hope modi reads it. Randia linking to Scoopwhoop which links to FB... this is a postception! 21 Reasons Why > Global Zionist banking cartel

Hindu-Yahoodi saazish. ..23 The fact that people worry about getting Vyapamed simply for liking or sharing this post Vyapamed in 3.....2.... I was a Modi supporter, even voted for him in 2014 just because other options weren't half as good as him. Obviously, who didn't think of him as a Messiah who'd save this country from Congress. 
Today, I couldn't have been more wrong, he's just all-talk no-work guy who promises amazing things, failed to deliver any of it. 
However, in my family, almost 95% of them are still pro-Modi, and they buy into each argument he makes. Each time, I try to reason with them, a staple dialogue of ""Congress ruled for 60 years, that shit can't be washed in 5 years"" is thrown around. Only the ones in Reddit, specifically r/India even talk about reason, whereas the entire community still believes in him.  chaiwala samajh nahi paayega I am from Banaras and lot of (read everyone) people in my social circle were a fan of Modi. People were hoping that he would do same to Banaras what Atal Ji did to Lucknow. They were very excited. Then I had to move to another country but when I returned back for vacations a lot of my friend were furious. They were unhappy that Modi allowed Yogi to be CM of UP. They voted for development and didn't expect such a dick move from him. We young generation from UP is really fed up with caste and religion politics. We want development and jobs. But what we got? Again same old shit. I was at least relieved that my friends are not fanboys. Some old people have also started criticizing Modi. They are also tired of religion shit and want jobs for their sons in the state.  inb4 he gets lynched, gets called out for being anti-nationalist, and is told to go to pakistan if he doesn't like it here. Modi is a chutiya of the highest order. Even if BJP wins in 2019 hope he gets kicked out along with that moron Amit Shah. > For being a government - not of India - but of Hindutva forces, crony corporations and foreign vested interests - **especially the Zionist global banking cartel**

Who is the fascist? if some muslim guy wrote this, he ll be picked up by pulis in middle of night. Agree with most but some of the points about Zionist Banking etc are just ridiculous and portrays the intellect of the writer in poor light.  He gon git arrested Ahh antisemetism looked over cause it’s anti Modi too? He can be arrested for Facebook post  Now that it's pretty evident  whose winning in Gujarat such articles would come out in full force
BTW when did Scoopwhoop become relevant ? lol, author is a conspiracy nut. Modi is supporting zionist banking cartel it seems, LOL The work that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done. I do not think so far anybody else has done the work like him. >For destroying India's economy via Demonetisation and not taking responsibility for the damage it has done.

First one. Is this true? Last numbers I heard is that Indias growth is over 6% and [is expected to continue](http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2015/01/14/india-china-gdp-growth-world-bank.jpg). Also, Chinas lead is decreasing. 

If this is economy ""destroyed"" what word is he using when growth is negative? 

Im not being facetious. Im genuinely wondering if economy is now destroyed. What are his indicators that this is the case. Seriously NAM ? Are living in sixties ? We Signed a defense cooperation treaty in 1960s which saved our ass against American nuclear missiles.

And had Israeli technology helping our army during Kargil.

The Nam countries didnt give a fuck when China attacked us in 1962.

Modi is just following what Congress was doing in 10 years who themselves were continuing the good work of Previous governments.

Criticizing the govt for it is just clueless. modi is much better than congrees if not the best.atleast he is doing something for the nation and taking risks unlike congress.
tell me a better option than bjp so that i can use my vote in a good way in 2019.

Policy/Economy,Is the Gandhi Family suppressing the Left-Wing of India? (I am a Foreigner),12,bu2q23,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bu2q23/is_the_gandhi_family_suppressing_the_leftwing_of/,12,"Recently, I have wondered whether the Gandhi family has truly hindered many progressive policies in order to uphold the Status Quo. 

We have seen this with Manmohan Singh, in which during UPA 2, Sonia Gandhi indirectly took more control over the party and we saw the downfall of many sectors of Government. Another instance of this is how the Gandhi Family disrespected Narasimha Rao, India's most progressive leader. A man who was able to liberalize the Indian economy and initiate many reforms within the Government. The Gandhi Family did not even allow Rao to have his funeral in Delhi and moved him back to Hyderabad.

Even as we witness AAP, which seems to be a Congress Party without the Gandhi family, it seems to be much more progressive and eager to change than Congress.

So as a non-Indian, I am curious, do you believe the Gandhi family is suppressing the Left of India, as it silences more progressive reforms and legislation, in favor of status quo?",Brainiac7777777," [removed] It has nothing to do with left. It's all about keeping the history books praising nothing but Gandhis. The same happened with Rao. He tried so hard to present the the reforms as a continuity to Rajiv's government. The case was far from truth. Rajiv had no idea of exonomics & his profligacy pushed us into the 1991 crisis. But still Rao turned that around. He was accused of being BJP's B-team in th babri masjid case while the fact is that he was cheated by the BJP guys who didnt keep their promise. It has nothinf to do with left. The Gandhi family doesnt want non-Gandhis to shine in the Indian history. Rajiv was worst PM ever & still people talk about Rajiv with respect. That is what Congress has done. I dont think the downfall of the left has anything to do with congress. The congress party is having a family crisis right now. It’s fascinating/scary to see the drama unfold as we speak. Indians love drama btw. 
As a young Indian, I’m quite happy with the results.",2019-05-29 01:18:50

**India Retains Position As Fastest Growing Economy, GDP Growth Accelerates To 7.7% In Q4** 

 ______ 
India retained its position as the world's fastest growing major economy in
the January-March quarter, well ahead of China. India's

GDP or gross domestic product

growth accelerated to 7.7 per cent in the March quarter - the fastest pace of
growth in seven quarters. Strong growth in agriculture (4.5 per cent),
manufacturing (9.1 per cent) and construction sectors (11.5 per cent)
contributed to the overall growth. Growth for Asia's third-largest economy,
reported by the Ministry of Statistics, trumped forecasts in a Reuters poll
for annual growth of 7.3 per cent. GDP had grown at a revised 7 per cent in
October-December quarter.

For the full year (2017-18), GDP expanded at 6.7 per cent, lower than the 7.1
per cent recorded in the previous year.

Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank, said: ""Today's GDP number is very
comforting and should put a lot of concerns to rest. It seems like we have
moved beyond the teething troubles related to GST implementation. The pick-up
in investment activity (fixed capital formation) is also a good sign.""  
  
The faster pace of growth in the latest quarter might also strengthen
expectations for a rate hike by the RBI later this year. ""We expect RBI to
revise its policy stance in June and follow it up with a hike of 25 bps in
August policy,"" said Garima Kapoor, economist and vice president at Elara
Capital.  

Many economists expect India's economy to grow more than 7 per cent in
2018-19, helped by a normal monsoon and a pickup in private investment.

Though global rating agency

Moody's earlier this week

cut its GDP growth forecast for India due to higher oil prices and tighter
financial conditions, it still expects the country's GDP to expand by 7.3 per
cent this fiscal year.

GDP growth in 2018-19 could get a boost from prospects of good monsoon,
potentially brightening the outlook for agricultural output.

Economists also point out to many risk factors that could put downward
pressure on GDP growth. Possibly, the biggest risk could be rising crude oil
prices, which this month hit $80 a barrel, their highest since 2014. India
meets 80 per cent of its oil needs from imports.

Domestic

prices of petrol and diesel

are near all-time highs, putting pressure on the government to bring down
taxes on the fuels.

Rising oil prices could also weigh on the consumer demand, say economists. The
government's Economic Survey, issued in January, estimated that every $10 per
barrel rise in global oil prices cuts growth by 0.2-0.3 percentage points.

Higher crude oil prices have already hurt the rupee, which slumped to near a
record low this month. It is down about 6 per cent so far this year against
the US dollar.

__ Comments

Banking credit, a main source for corporate borrowing, has remained weak
following a surge in bad loans, as banks have been reluctant to extend new
loans. The 21 state lenders hold two-thirds of banking assets, and accounted
for the bulk of the record $150 billion of soured loans in the banking sector
in 2017.

Separately, infrastructure sector recorded a 4.7 per cent growth in April, as
against 2.6 per cent a year ago, data released by government showed.

But by the promises I make in this interview. ""Don't judge me on the basis of my two biggest policy failures,"" says elected politician. Either he is a moron or he thinks his audience are morons. Oh... we forgot to congratulate the PM on his *second* ever interview in 3 years!! Round of applause people. He was finally able to make it out of his mansion to give another interview with no difficult questions! It must have been quite the task to get all the questions correct.  Did he just admit that Demonetisation was a failure? Should we then judge him on:

- Imposing an Adhaar which was meant only for public distribution service on everyone in an orwellian way.

- Having the worst record for job creation. 

- Residing over the worst private investment record since 1950's.

Edit: - A Rafale deal which was steeped in crony capitalism.

- Increasing income inequality.

- Enriching babaji's who masquerade as spiritual gurus. Providing them army to build bridges for private events and suppressing activists who protest against environmental destruction for other babaji's from the south.

- Taking advice on demonotisation from a babaji who on behalf of a quack think tank reccomended demonitisation to Mudi.

- Completley bending foreign policy to the west and not adhering to decades of non aligned status. 

- Almost selling off and destroying India's generics industry in the first 6 months of power which would have made basic drugs cost an arm and a leg to attract 'fdi' only to see a backlash.

- Completely disintegrating out military industrial complex that was on the verge of next gen technology only to buy equipment from foreign companies with zero transfer of technology so foreigners and crony capitalists can profit

- Paying zero attention to the agriculture sector which has been completely destroyed.

- Paying no attention no attention to SME sector which is dying without credit while behaving like an NRI prime minister and begging foreign firms to make in India

- Throwing Rajan out to help his crony capitalist friends; i.e so they don't have to pay back their loans

- Spending billions on novelty projects like trains while making no investments in healthcare.

- reducing healthcare spending to try turn India's healthcare into US healthcare shitty and expensive

- MP's like Mahesh Giri who were formerly with babaji's who support Modi using violence against JNU and beating women reporters and calling them anti national.

- Generally using violence as a state policy and killing judges, reporters and activists.

- Trying to destroy the judiciary and making the last institution of India the SC which is honest into a dalali organisation

- making absolutely zero economic reforms to help the common man.

- furthering Hindutva/cow politics  not Hinduism/Sanatan Dharam and sponsoring state violence against dalits.

- Opening up INdia's economy like the real estate sector and retail to foreign speculators while asking for nothing in return i.e visas or job permit increases. Which then bail out builders and destroy the economy.

- Lying about building electricity access and infrastructure at a faster pace.

- Looting money from the public through various cess's like Swach Bharat etc.

- Trying to destroy the environment in order to build infrastructure including vast tracts of forest. Ok... let's talk cow vigilantism? Or moral policing? Or hate speeches? Or rising intolerance? Or the failure of clean Ganga? Or swachh Bharat? Or let's talk about Adityanath becoming a dictator? Or the lack of a policy on Pakistan? Or China making inroads in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal?  Evaluate me on inciter, instigator, provocateur, rabble-rouser, demagoguery skills, rather. We all can judge him on throwing skills (feku). Mitron!!! Evaluate me on the unemployment crisis, the lack of private investment in the county, rising malnutrition, making AYUSH equal to allopathy (MCI Bill), supporting Aadhar after I opposed it, having biryani with China after I ridiculed my predecessor for it, the rising inflation, destroying institutions like the RTI, CEC and CVC, not appointing Lokpal after almost 4 years and renaming schemes.  Kyun behen ke loude... GST and demonitisation is what affected every common man across the country.  This clown really thinks that people have short memory spans and all.

Abki baar, u-turn waali sarkaar. Judge him for Aadhaar, Bullet Train, and Cow Vigilantes as well lol. Ummm, what about the things like cleaning Ganga, etc. that never ended up happening? There is no “allowed to keep terms” for your next 5.   There is no worse 'journalist' on TV than that prick taking the interview. Even Rajat Sharma and Arnab are better. I wonder if bhakts trying to spin this in a positive way are wondering if they are about to have  aneurism. What a retard. A couple of months ago, he was touting DeMo and GST as successes and now he just admitted to them being failures. He needs to see the latest C voter survey to rid him of the insecurities he feels. Judge me by the number of cows I have saved and the jumlas I have made. Hope someone could do epic rap battles between this guy and trump. ""Logon ke ghar main beti ki shadi hai, or paisa nahi"" ...

**Don’t evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, says PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged the nation to not judge him only
on the basis of his decisions to implement demonetisation and GST. “Don’t
evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, we brought economic reform, built
toilets, brought electricity to 18000 villages,” PM Modi said in an exclusive
interview with Zee News.

Talking about his global approach, the Prime Minister who recently hosted his
Israeli counterpart in New Delhi and Gujarat said, “They said my understanding
was limited to Gujarat. I made it my strength. I did not follow protocol, I
was a simple man with no baggage. I made friends the world over.”

On the upcoming World Economic Forum, Modi said that the world wants to hear
“directly from the Horse’s mouth.” The PM also talked about India’s policies
and growth potential and expressed that he felt proud to represent India in
Davos.

Stating that the Indian economy is growing at a rapid pace, PM Modi said the
Davos meet is a “good opportunity” for the country as it is a big market with
the strength of demographic dividend. “The country is seeing the biggest jump
in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). It is natural that the world wants to talk
directly to India and the world wants to hear directly from the horse’s mouth
about India’s policies and potential. It matters if you hear it from the
leader,” he added.

Meanwhile, Modi also stressed on his push for conducting simultaneous polls
for Lok Sabha and state assemblies and said that like festivals it should be
held on fixed schedule.

Policy/Economy,A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,9,bwmz0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,6,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

Policy/Economy,Dr Manmohan Singh is the Real GDP King; Jaitley’s Blog cannot Change it,45,99b2zl,https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/dr-manmohan-singh-is-the-real-gdp-king-fm-jaitleys-blog-cannot-change-it,15,,thewebdev," > The Twitter hashtag #DrSinghGDPKing 

Cool. > The Modi government has once again got a panic attack. The Twitter hashtag #DrSinghGDPKing caused it. The underlying reason behind the alarming palpitations is a research panel of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation releasing a back-series adjusted GDP based on 2011-12 prices to make GDP comparisons dispassionate shorn of political googlies. This would enable holistic policy-making besides providing fodder for rigorous academic reasoning. **The Bharatiya Janata Party’s acute nervousness was on account of two manifestations of the sub-committee’s findings:**

> - 1) As expected, UPA-1 ( 2004-09) had a record-breaking five-year average GDP growth of 8.87%, an unprecedented score in India’s history.

> - 2) Even the much-maligned, badgered UPA-2 had a more impressive lead over the headline-grabbing hyperbolic NDA, 7.39% as against 7.2%.

> **Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote a hurried, poorly researched rhetorical blog**, Niti Aayog chief put out a few dubious tweets as a diversionary tactic ...

> ... Jaitley & co made an embarrassingly phlegmatic attempt to puncture UPA-1’s triumphant performance. **According to them, Dr Manmohan Singh inherited a booming 8.1% GDP growth from the Vajpayee government** in 2003-04 and just rode a providential bonanza thereafter ... **What he artfully dodges is that in the preceding year of 2001-02, the GDP had touched a nadir of 3.7% , even lower than the 3.9% of 2000-01** ... **Truth be said, NDA-1 just about averaged 5.6%**, and was easily outclassed by the formidable Dr Singh-P Chidambaram-Montek Singh Ahluwalia triumvirate.

> ... Jaitley then caustically refers to fiscal profligacy of average 5% of GDP under UPA, while selectively ignoring that under NDA-1 fiscal deficit was higher at 5.5% . That is called cherry-picking. **Under NDA-1 the average crude oil price was around $30 per barrel, while under UPA that skyrocketed to over $145 at one stage**; Jaitley has a memory loss of this stupendous escalation when discussing the inflationary impact. Yet, one of the most extraordinary accomplishments in human history happened during UPA; **poverty declined by over two-and-a-half times than under NDA and 140 million people were lifted out of poverty, the second largest ever after China.** Naturally, Jaitley did not mention this crucial statistic in India’s celebrated growth story under Dr Singh. A pity, really.

> ... **agriculture under UPA grew at an annualised 3.6%, while it was 2.2% under NDA-1.** Private consumption went up 40% faster under the UPA as did private disposable income at 20% as compared to NDA’s 8.3%. At core, **both the rural farmers and urban dwellers were better off under Dr Singh.** ...

> Jaitley is being mendacious with facts when he talks of alleged scams ... The tradition has continued in NDA-2 with Nirav Modi, Mehul Bhai Choksi and some other close buddies of the current dispensation ...

> ... **UPA-2 (7.39) has outperformed NDA-2 (7.2%) as well by a convincing margin** despite overwhelming headwinds; I list four of them.

> **First, UPA-2 faced the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007/8** which literally incinerated economies worldwide. It’s ramifications were both geographically spread (the Eurozone crisis) as well as structurally penetrative. It was the world’s most testing survival period after the Great Depression of the 1930s.

> **Secondly, oil prices reached a dizzying average of over $110 a barrel**, creating a massive pressure on current account deficit and fiscal deficit, and adding to an inflationary spiral. 

> **Third, UPA had a coalition government** and thus required circumspect calibration in policy-making which was done with adroit political maturity through consensus building. 

> **Fourth, it was actually parliamentary paralysis** (which Jaitley famously described as legitimate political strategy) forced by a belligerent BJP that created a gridlock and prevented the GST and several legislation from becoming a reality during UPA’s tenure.

> **Yet, UPA-2 has done better than NDA-2, who have had the tailwind of oil prices at $28 at one stage, low inflation, a majority government, growing world economy and above all, a strong inheritance of a robust recovering economy from the UPA-2 of 6.4%. Incidentally, UPA crossed double-digit growth rates twice during its 10-year period.** GONNA VOTE FOR CONGRESS. he is also King of Inflation.

Policy/Economy,Questions for supporters of the current Government in India,65,9xtncw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9xtncw/questions_for_supporters_of_the_current/,67,"I want to ask BJP and Modi supporters some questions.

Did or did not Modi say that all black money is in Swiss Banks? If he did, how much of that black money has come back in 4.5 years?

Did or did not Modi say that high prices of Petrol, Diesel and Gas have a bad effect on economy and that people of Gujarat are suffering because of bad policies and failure of Dr. Manmohan Singh's government? If he did, then how come prices are at an all time high now?

Did or did not Modi say that the falling value of rupee is because of corruption in Delhi? Then how come rupee went to almost 75 to a dollar? Would that also mean that there is still corruption in Delhi?

Did or did not Modi say that MNREGA is a living example of failure of Congress government which is getting ditches dug and filled even after 65 years of independence? If he did, then why did he continue the MNREGA program?

Did or did not Modi say that GST can never be implemented in India? If he did then why did he implement it and that too even on clothes and fabric (which has never been taxed in independent India)?

Did or did not Modi say that FDI will hurt the small retailers and kill the biggest segment that provides jobs? Then why did he allow FDI in retail and 100% FDI in single brand retail?

Did or did not Modi say that he will send Congress leaders and other corrupt people from his own party to jail? If he did, then how many people has he even filed an FIR, forget about sending to jail?

Did or did not Modi say that nobody will use a Bullet Train but we should have it just as a symbol of our technological achievement? If he did then why take a loan of 1,10,000 Crores to build some thing that nobody is going to use anyway?

Did or did not Modi say that he will give One-Rank-One-Pension to retired soldiers? If he did then how come he gave One-Rank-One-Pension-Every-Five-Years to them?

Did or did not Modi say that farmers will get 50% clean profit over and above their costs? Then how come there is budget for procuring just 5% of farmers production at that prices and the farmers are being left at the mercy of private buyers after Government procurement budgets and targets are met?

Did or did not Modi say that if people voted for him then they will be assured 'Good-Days' ahead? If he did, then has anyone seen those 'Good-Days' till now?

There is no reason to elect him or his party again.

On the contrary taking decisions like Demonetization and implementing a faulty GST and now the 59,000 Crore Rafale deal show that his decision making is faulty and damaging for the country.

In the Rafale deal he has committed treason (desh droh) with the country by reducing the number of aircraft from 126 to 36, paying extra price and hurting the PSU HAL at the cost of private entity of Anil Ambani.

It will be India's misfortune if he somehow comes back to power.

So if you are patriotic, throw out the garbage.

You have nothing to fear from anyone, especially the Muslims. In fact they live in mortal fear even though they belong to this country and love it, love it probably more than you do.",waahmudijiwaah," Yesterday I was watching election coverage in MP and Rajasthan. And almost all small businessmen said they used to support BJP but GST and Notebandi has ruined their business. Though BJP bhakts are still high on demonetization claiming it eliminated black money. So asking them questions expecting rational and practical answer is unfair to their intelligence.  You missed the real treason committed by not only Modi but every single BJP MPs sitting in parliament that day. This particular instance was the day I concluded that BJP is worse than even ISIS. These retarded shameless fucks sold out our entire nation, everything we fought for; our independence and sovereignty of India in the future , all ruined by these brainless retards BJP and RSS.

They legalised corruption and foreign interference in Indian politics by letting foreign powers(even foreign government by a shell company and private companies, remember east India company?) fund Indian political parties and elections. They later also made these donations anonymous, so that its never revealed who funded our government. And all this was passed illegally as a money bill along with many other bills sticked together. Check the FCRA amendment and all the other related bills.

This taking foreign funds to change or affect the outcome of our Indian election is the very definition of Treason. There is no bigger treason that you betraying your country by taking money from foreigners to represent them in the PARLIAMENT OF INDIA and betraying the PEOPLE OF INDIA. ANd the traitor party made this legal and anonymous so that no one will know. Are you a teenager? If not, by now you should have realized that Indians accept a baseline level of lies and dishonesty from all governments and all parties. 

It does not matter that these people are liars and dishonest, but at least they are our liars (belong to our tribe, cast, etc). Got it now? Oooo.. logic and everything is being used here. 
Can we get back to important issues like Ayodhya and cow urine.  People who use religion or cast or ethnicity to spread hate are the enemy of the nation. Every Indian who is true to his salt should raise his / her voice against them. >You have nothing to fear from anyone, especially the Muslims. In fact they live in mortal fear even though they belong to this country and love it, love it probably more than you do.

This. Not just Muslims but Christians and other religion as well, not that many religions except for those two. Remember how churches were being attacked too for no reason in 2014. 

Just before Rajasthan polls now, Aaj Tak is claiming there is gonna be a Terrorist attack by muslim groups in rallies of you know who. This is the standard tactic of BJP to polarize the voters just days before Modi's rallies and the voting day. And shamefully mainstream media spreads this without consulting Investigating agencies. This is the shit game they are playing which seems to be working out for them right now. 

But it's a design they have created even before Independence if India, which they have successfully done it with years of creating enough poison and hate.

You wouldn't hear that from any Muslims and Christians in rallies and speeches, they don't make one except for that Owaisi who works for Modi as an scripted enemy. [deleted] They don't take questions. Why is it that governments rarely do anything they say during elections in India? Whether it is NDA or UPA, I have rarely seen them deliver on promises, whereas in the west the governments do deliver. Why doesn't it work in India? [deleted] Your question is too complicated for bhakts who have have the attention span of a goldfish and critical thinking skills of a peahen. 

All they can remember are the catchy slogans.. for eg. ""Mandir vahi banayenge"" or ""go to Pakistan"". Everything else is ""bhains ke aage bhagwat"".  Whom would you vote for instead of just opposing Modi? What are the best ideas of the opposition to vote for if not the personalities? What is their track record? >Did or did not Modi say that all black money is in Swiss Banks? If he did, how much of that black money has come back in 4.5 years?

No data on this yet.

>Did or did not Modi say that high prices of Petrol, Diesel and Gas have a bad effect on economy and that people of Gujarat are suffering because of bad policies and failure of Dr. Manmohan Singh's government? If he did, then how come prices are at an all time high now?

Inflation and a bull run in crude market. Bears are on the horizon so crude will drop soon.

>Did or did not Modi say that the falling value of rupee is because of corruption in Delhi? Then how come rupee went to almost 75 to a dollar? Would that also mean that there is still corruption in Delhi?


Rupee is holding its own pretty well. Its the dollar that's grown strong thanks to Trump. Rupee is performing well against other global currencies. That's the reason other developed and developing economies are willing to deal with India in terms of rupee and exchange currencies, rather than face a strong dollar.

>Did or did not Modi say that MNREGA is a living example of failure of Congress government which is getting ditches dug and filled even after 65 years of independence? If he did, then why did he continue the MNREGA program?

Rural road construction is at an all time high. MNREGA is doing fine here in UP villages, don't know about the rest.

>Did or did not Modi say that GST can never be implemented in India? If he did then why did he implement it and that too even on clothes and fabric (which has never been taxed in independent India)?

Not sure when he said that, election rhetoric maybe? As for GST on textiles, and everything else, doesn't affect me much in my daily life.

>Did or did not Modi say that FDI will hurt the small retailers and kill the biggest segment that provides jobs? Then why did he allow FDI in retail and 100% FDI in single brand retail?

Election rhetoric? FDI is doing well to fill RBI coffers, also I'm pro-FDI. Wanted FDI to come, they brought it in, I'm happy.

>Did or did not Modi say that he will send Congress leaders and other corrupt people from his own party to jail? If he did, then how many people has he even filed an FIR, forget about sending to jail?

National Herald case is almost done. Expecting a positive judgement out of it.

>Did or did not Modi say that nobody will use a Bullet Train but we should have it just as a symbol of our technological achievement? If he did then why take a loan of 1,10,000 Crores to build some thing that nobody is going to use anyway?

That's like asking why invest in bringing PET-CT because nobody is going to use it, why not just make more X-ray machines? Your question is badly framed.

>Did or did not Modi say that he will give One-Rank-One-Pension to retired soldiers? If he did then how come he gave One-Rank-One-Pension-Every-Five-Years to them?

Have a maternal uncle who retired as a Major. He's happy with it, and says its a good decision.

>Did or did not Modi say that farmers will get 50% clean profit over and above their costs? Then how come there is budget for procuring just 5% of farmers production at that prices and the farmers are being left at the mercy of private buyers after Government procurement budgets and targets are met?

MSP has been increased, right? Don't know the details though. Will read and respond. As for farmers, they're pretty happy with subsidised seeds, soil health cards and the addition of Neem to Urea. There used to be gun-fights just a decade back in my native village over Urea cuz corporations would steal it and there was little available for farmers. Now with Neem added, its a boon for farmers.

>Did or did not Modi say that if people voted for him then they will be assured 'Good-Days' ahead? If he did, then has anyone seen those 'Good-Days' till now?

I'm doing good. Roads are great, rare powercuts unlike that month long coal-shortage fiasco of summer 2012, railway Platforms are clean, cheap internet, cheap food, better salaries. Don't know for you, but my life has improved since this Government came.

>There is no reason to elect him or his party again.

Roads, rural electrification, railways, RERA, IBC, salary-hikes, controlled inflation, UDAAN scheme, UJWALA, Ayushmann Bharat, Mission Indradhanush, more medical colleges and hospitals, sanitation, well maintained airports. There's loads of reasons, least of which is the absolute lack of vision in the opposition whose sole focus seems to be defeating him. I'd rather vote for him than a makeshift mess of a coalition that has no goals beyond seizing power.

>On the contrary taking decisions like Demonetization and implementing a faulty GST and now the 59,000 Crore Rafale deal show that his decision making is faulty and damaging for the country.

Demo was a grand failure, yes. As for GST, all my baniya friends are anguished that they now have to pay taxes which were easily evaded previously - I'm happy that I'm not the only one bearing the taxes anymore. Rafale deal is in court, I'd wait for the judgement before making any conclusions in something that is a government secret and rarely anyone knows anything about.

>It will be India's misfortune if he somehow comes back to power

That's your view, and this is a democracy. We are privileged to have our own views. Mine differs from yours. Neither of us are completely correct. That's just how things are.

>So if you are patriotic, throw out the garbage.

No u.

>You have nothing to fear from anyone, especially the Muslims. In fact they live in mortal fear even though they belong to this country and love it, love it probably more than you do.

Never been an issue for me. And stop judging me for my love for the country.

***

If you're trying to change people's views, better not start blaming then right away. Try a discussion rather than outright ""Love it probably more than you do"" crap. You're simply pushing them further towards the right by saying stuff like that.

Edit: Yes, bring on the downvotes instead of responding to my views. Good going. My karma is pretty low but it will probably hit rock bottom when I am done.    
    
First, when making so many statements, it is better to provide sources so people can read the article and then give a rebuttal.
   
I feel Modi overpromised and didn't keep up with his promises. I feel he and his party directly or indirectly focused a bit much on religion and not on delivering.    
    
Did his party not achieve everything they said they would? Definitely, if they did they would be the first political party in the world to ever to do it.    
    
Did his party do good things in their run? I would say yes.    
    
Could his party have done more? Obviously yes.    
    
   
> Modi and black money.    
    
He has definitely taken steps to curb black money. The income declaration scheme brought black money into market. The acts of benami transaction act and black money and imposition of tax act also helped curb black money. In a possible shrewd play, Indian government and Swiss banks signed a pact where the banks would reveal names of black money in 2019. Whether it is true or false, how effective it is, that is to be seen but he did take measures.    
    
Just so, I am not called a ""bhakt"" let me say it outright **DEMONETIZATION WAS A FAILURE**. Modi underestimated the jugaad level Indians have and it failed. There were some positives but they are small compared to the main objective of demonetization which was black money.

> Modi and rising rupee prices ( also oil )    
    
Rising rupee hurts Indians yes. But is it Modi's fault?    
In 2009 INR USD was at 48, by 2014 when new party came in power in 2014 it was 60. Until April 2018 dollar was at 66 or so. It was maintained really good, just 8 Rs rise in 4 years is really good.    
    
Now someone will point out it is 72 right and oil has shot up. Yes it has, if you look at historical data, you can see rupee shot up near May and has been climbing? What happened in May 2018?    
    
Trump pulled out of the Iran deal and put sanctions back on Iran. Iran's chief export is oil. We import a LOT of oil so our prices shot up. India imports almost all of it's oil as we have no large oil basins. So as oil costs went up, our expenditure went up to purchase oil which lead to rise in rupee and also oil prices.    
    
Our government could subsidize oil prices like UPA did but the repayment of interests hurts the next government, I believe that the policy ""let us spend to keep our voter base happy and let the next government handle the aftermath and the shitstorm is wrong"" , it is my personal opinion.    
    
You may differ.    
    
As you may have noticed that oil prices have been falling and not touched the all time high of September. Again the global cost of oil fell which led to our costs going down.    
    
Fun fact : To curb India's huge dependence on oil, Modi has stepped up investment in renewable energy sector, India is one of the faster growing market in renewable energy.

>Modi and MNREGA    
   
Modi did criticize it and wanted to scrap it. However there was public outcry against it and congress labelled them as anti poor. It is also an immensely successful program in terms of reaching across India, so Modi kept it but tweaking the nature of the program to make it more productive.    
    
Even Manmohan Singh who launched the program said there are problems in it which have to be addressed.    
   
Modi changed the scheme by allowing direct disbursement to the workers rather than middle man and used the Jan Dhan accounts and Aadhar to curb any leakage of funds or corruption. Economically Modi is right that it creates a drain but it is a very popular scheme so to not anger the population they decided to keep it. He streamlined it and made it more efficient.

So as you can see the government has taken steps to solve the problems you addressed, could it have been better? Of course yes.    
    
    
You can find faults in each and every government and you should. But completely neglecting all the good things they have done and only focus only on negative is a bad thing I would say. Being a supporter or not seems irrelevant. Answer to all questions above is as follows 'This is Politics and there's nothing called clean Politics. Indian Politics has always been Majoritarianism. You have a choice to fight, accept or leave.' Well... Election is about choosing lesser fool isnt it?  Not a BJP supporter but i dont think there are other viable options.",2018-11-17 12:49:07

Does anyone have a book they can recommend about both the politics and policy in India, from immediately after we gained independence till as close to present time as possible? 

Hopefully I’d like it to cover all about the Congress dominance right through the rise of the BJP in the late 80’s, private economy revolution of the 90’s to the shitshow we are in today. 

And also the major incidents/scams that have happened in our history. Blue Star, 1992, bofors, Gujarat 2002, 2g etc.

Policy/Economy,"'The Husband, The Wife and The Wife Deserter': A Tale Of Triple Talaq.",4,c3okk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c3okk1/the_husband_the_wife_and_the_wife_deserter_a_tale/,2,"As the Triple Talaq Bill is on the verge of becoming an actual law, let's take a look at what triple talaq is, what it is not and what really is at the heart of the whole debate. 

Triple Talaq is something that Islam itself traditionally frowns upon. Scholars have warned against it since time immemorial and it's generally strongly disliked. Its sole purpose was to serve as a remedy for the *really* troubled marriages and some historians believe that it was originally granted by the Prophet as a means for the 'women' who were married to the most despicable men so that they'd escape that relationship as soon as possible. But, as often tends to happen with most well-intentioned laws, people managed to find the loopholes and favored the 'letter' of the law over the 'spirit' of the law. And as such, most Muslims would be absolutely okay with the illegalization or nullification of triple talaq, but more on that towards the end.

Speaking of laws and women, Islam is the first religion in history to have given women 'rights': social rights, ownership rights, inheritance rights, marriage rights, the right to initiate divorce, the right to remarry, the right to be a witness and give testimony in matters requiring the same, the right to do business (the Prophet's first wife, Khadijah, was a wealthy merchant herself), the right to fight in battle and many many more. Fourteen HUNDRED years ago. 

But, over time, some Muslims twisted the teachings of Islam to suit their own purpose, misused and downright *violated* the very laws of Islam protecting the sanctity of women's rights.. And, over time, it also became okay for the rest of the world to somehow always find a way to judge the 'entirety' of the Muslim community and religion based on the examples set by these worst of Muslims, who are completely unrepresentative of both Islam and most Muslims. 

Anyway, before I digress, coming back to divorce.. So, more than 1400 years ago, Muslim women were granted the right to initiate divorce through the legal sharia process referred to as *'khula'*. (This when women around the world were either burned at the stake for wanting rights or had to promise to be married to the same man for seven lives or had to throw themselves into the pyre with him when he died.)

This is what the normal, the more 'preferred' mode of talaq (divorce) looks like: It's supposed to be done in three stages, over a period equaling roughly three months, and only after the grounds for it have been firmly established (infidelity, adultery, betrayal, loss of affection, etc). Even this 'normal' form of divorce is only meant to be the 'last resort' when nothing seems to have worked to save the marriage. The first month, provided the grounds for divorce are not major (infidelity and/or adultery) and if there is the slightest hope for reconciliation, both the spouses are encouraged to find common ground and rethink their stance, the second month, once again, is time for reflection and possible reconciliation, and only at the end of the third month, when *all* attempts at reconciliation have clearly failed, is the divorce deemed to be finalized and can the spouses part ways.

Anyway, THAT is the 'normal' approach of going about divorce in Islam. And surprise surprise, THAT is how most Muslims actually go about getting a divorce. Most Muslims, too, generally hate the idea of triple talaq. Remember, it's *supposed* to be an absolute last-resort measure, *if that*. Here's a report based on a survey which found that of all the divorce cases amongst Muslims, a mere '0.3' percent were identified as those performed through triple talaq. Less than 1 percent. 

https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unimportance-of-triple-talaq-supreme-court-muslim-law-4678304/

Yes, 0.3 percent. THAT is how low the incidence of triple talaq really is. Let me just say it once again so it really sinks in. ZERO POINT THREE percent. 

But, how many of you knew that? Or rather, how many of you were led to believe that 'most' of the divorces among Muslims happen the triple talaq way? Or that it's so prevalent among Muslims that 'millions' of Muslim women are simply abandoned by their husbands within seconds? Or that it's because Islam itself encourages it? Or that it's because women simply have no rights in Islam to begin with? 

Many, if not everyone. 

That brings us now to the second, the hidden yet the more important part of this discussion: the 'politics, propaganda and Islamophobia' aspect of it. 

If you could time-travel to today's India from ten years before, odds are you'd find it barely recognizable. 2019 was supposed to be the year when we were just a year away from the watershed moment we dreamed of that would forever change our nation's destiny. We were going to be a developed, happy, prosperous nation, the vision of APJ Abdul Kalam come to life. 

But, it's safe to say that that dream is much farther from being a reality *today* than it was ten years ago. And however unrealistic or unattainable that dream may have been to begin with, I am sure nobody in their wildest dreams ever imagined an India where a 'terrorist' would be elected to the parliament and become a 'lawmaker' in 2019.

A deeply radicalized, bigoted and easily manipulated religious majority has set the country back by many many years, if not decades. Such is the level of toxic propaganda and such is the intolerance of the truth that nothing and absolutely nothing seems to have the potential to stem the flow of this madness anytime soon. 

And it is in this backdrop that it became possible for a man who abandoned his mother, abandoned his wife decades ago and presided over riots that saw hundreds of women get brutally killed and thousands get raped, to rise to be the 'messiah' for Muslim women and their rights and for everyone else to buy into this whole charade. 

And this allowed everyone to believe that the 'logical' solution to correct the injustice of triple talaq was to 'jail' the man for three years based on a report filed by almost anyone, keep the woman on a measly welfare fund for the same duration, keep her children far away from their father and, thus, eventually, to 'save' the marriage. 

If you still think that the triple talaq bill, in its present manifestation, is anything other than a deeply hateful, vengeful exercise of power through which to punish Muslims for, well, *being* Muslims, you clearly are on the wrong side of history.

 ______ 
**Modi may be the last hope for the Indian economy to achieve greatness** 

 ______ 
Recent weeks have witnessed an enormous amount of hand-wringing in the press
about India’s economy. These articles share a common thematic trajectory: they
start with a recitation of statistics that highlight a slowdown, lay it on the
doorsteps of demonetisation and GST, and in the grand tradition of the blood-
sport which is Indian politics, either use these statistics to settle personal
scores, or, as in the case of the political opposition, use it to prepare
oneself for 2019 with nervous glee. None of this hand-wringing is accompanied
with any insight or solutions beyond the obvious.

The fox knows many things. The hedgehog knows one important thing.

In a now famous essay written when he was an Oxford Don in the 1930’s, Isaiah
Berlin classified people into foxes and hedgehogs as a means of making a
distinction about people and the different ways in which they confront
reality. Foxes, according to Berlin, may know many things, but a coherent
worldview is beyond their comprehension. The hedgehog, however, knows one
great truth, and steadfast in its pursuit, remains unreconciled until he/she
reaches it.

This parable is perhaps the best way to understand Narendra Modi and his
actions surrounding the economy. Modi is the hedgehog who knows what India
needs to do to become prosperous, but importantly, is also willing to act upon
it. Indeed, he may be the only politician in contemporary Indian history who
has undertaken structural reforms out of choice rather than, like Narasimha
Rao in the 1990’s, being compelled to do so.

Structural reform is thankless: costs are borne upfront, and rewards come
later. (The currency for this transaction is political capital, and Arun
Jaitley has paid the most for his role as the able knight who is the face of
such change.) For years, it was the very absence of these structural reforms
that armchair foxes have bemoaned. Now that the reforms are occurring, the
foxes are coming out of the forest, and unwilling to pay the price, claim that
these are ill-timed, ill-conceived or ill-executed.

Through his decade-long executive leadership of one of India’s richest states,
Modi knows what the foxes don’t: First, that there’s never a right time to
make a hard choice, and second, the slowdown is the result of a fundamental
fragility of the Indian economy baked into India’s economic foundation at its
creation: the government’s overwhelming role in the economy.

Modi is seeking to eliminate this fragility by recalibrating the entire engine
of India’s economic growth methodically: Jaitley’s increasing of the states’
share in the divisible pool of union taxes in 2015,
digitisation/demonetisation of the economy in 2016, the GST in 2017, Piyush
Goyal’s work in the power sector over the last three years, Nitin Gadkari’s
ongoing work in transportation, all are transformative and quantifiable
contributors to the structure of the economy, and designed to create a robust
and higher equilibrium for the Indian economy from which it can propel itself
higher.

That these reforms are happening without any taint on any senior politician of
the government is in itself a first in India’s modern history. The republic
was lucky to survive through years of pillage under the Congress, and if it
were nothing else but just that the BJP is taint-free, we would still have
much to be thankful for.

But Modi’s toughest test is yet to come. Just as Modi fought the culture wars
and reshaped our national discourse on identity and nationhood for all time,
and just as how he is transforming India’s foreign policy through a new Modi-
doctrine, he must now dismantle the greatest vestige of Jawaharlal Nehru’s and
Indira Gandhi’s legacy: the socialist superstructure that is the curse of
India. Only when he is finished, will he have succeeded in his undeclared
personal ambition: to bury Nehru and Indira Gandhi forever.

To do so involves treating the economic organisation of a society not merely
in transactional terms, but as a moral issue inextricably linked to individual
rights and dignity, and moving wholeheartedly towards the only economic system
that provides for such: a free-market system adapted to help those on India’s
economic margins.

In doing so, he would do well to reduce his reliance on ever wiser economic
councils and bureaucrats, but follow his hedgehog instincts which have yielded
such sharp results in foreign policy and India’s culture wars. (As an aside, I
note with some amusement a lesson from my first class in economics with
Professor Jagdish Bhagwati: “India did so badly in the 50’s and 60’s not
because it had too few economists, but because it had too many!”)

This then, is the call to arms. In addition to a dogged focus on anti-
corruption (a necessary issue for 2014 but insufficiently ambitious for 2019),
Modi needs to speak to the country in civilisational terms about the manner of
its economic organisation, and seek the mandate to put the nation on the path
to double-digit growth for decades to come.

In practical terms, and as a first step, it requires the sale of the
government-owned banks and PSU’s in their entirety. Not re-capitalisation, not
mere NPA-resolution, not partial-disinvestment of loss-making PSU’s etc. A
complete sale. These are giant black holes that destroy capital, or at best,
use it sub-optimally. Modi cannot rebuild a nation without removing the
termites from its foundation.

By seizing the time still available in 2017-2019 (and perhaps for five years
thereafter), Modi may still live up to his own revolutionary declaration of
2014: “Government has no role in business”. Modi may represent the last best
hope for the Indian economy to achieve true greatness. If Modi doesn’t do it
now, India will be condemned to this middling, snakes-and-ladder growth
pattern for another several generations.

If not Modi, then who? If not now, then when?

The hedgehog knows.

Coal in the United States is a dying industry. Coal mines in West Virginia and Wyoming have long been [closing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-10-13/large-west-virginia-coal-mine-with-400-workers-closing) their doors, and total coal consumption in 2018 is close to half of what it [was ](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692)a decade ago. It is likely the coal power plants will struggle to survive without [subsidies](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/06/donald-trump-hopes-to-save-americas-failing-coal-fired-power-plants). However, it would be a mistake to assume that coal is a dying industry. Many large countries, including India, Indonesia, and China are rapidly increasing their use of coal. In today's podcast episode, I will be exploring India's coal industry, focusing on the struggles of Coal India, the public sector enterprise that dominates coal mining, to dig up enough coal to meet India's demand, the inability of coal and other extractive industries to bring development to the regions where they are most active, and the implications of India's increasing use of coal on the global environment.

Coal India Limited, a state controlled mining company that [controls ](https://www.coalindia.in/DesktopModules/DocumentList/documents/Annual_Report_&_Accounts_2014-15_Deluxe_version_In_English_03102015.pdf)82% of the coal market, has dominated coal mining in India since its creation in 1971. Coal India has struggled to meet the demands of India's rapidly growing economy because it is expected to provide coal to power plants at costs well below global market levels. Coal India was forced to sell coal at prices 70% below market [averages](https://www.ft.com/content/9233696a-8323-11e1-9f9a-00144feab49a), reducing Coal India profits by half. Similarly, Coal India has long [subsidized ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/)passengers on Indian Railways by paying above market rates to transport coal. Coal India is legally obligated to hire all of those its mines displace, and strong unions command wages that consume [half ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/coal-india-high-wage-bills-cast-a-shadow-on-coal-majors-numbers/articleshow/13617713.cms?from=mdr)it revenues. Moreover, corruption and mismanagement at the highest level have resulted in windfall gains to connected companies of [$33 billion](https://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html) . A violent and powerful coal mafia has [emerged ](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-jharkhand-dhanbad-coalindia/special-report-coal-mafia-stokes-indias-power-crisis-idINDEE94D00B20130514)that skims money off of each stage of coal production and distribution, with ""Goon taxes"" rising as [high ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208)as 10%. The combination of these factors means that Coal India does not have nearly enough money to invest in mechanization and new technologies. Labor productivity of Indian miners is only 4% of that of those in the US, and only 1 in 10 mines are [mechanized](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-s-keeping-india-dark). The result are severe shortages in coal that act as a serious break on rapid [development](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/indian-govt-grapples-to-find-causes-of-coal-shortages-2018-11-26).

A problem just as severe as Coal India's inability to produce enough coal for the Indian economy, is the fact that coal and other extractive industries have failed to bring prosperity and development to the regions in which they are concentrated. A vastly disproportionate share of India's coal reserves are located in the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These states are the home of around 8% of India's population, but [over ](http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy%20Statistics%202019-finall.pdf)two thirds of India's coal reserves. India's iron ore, bauxite, and copper reserves are all disproportionately located in these [states](http://www.jsmdc.in/web/AvailabilityofMineralsinJharkhand.php). However, these three states are also among the poorest in India, with rates of GDP per capita, and human development metrics such as infant mortality substantially worse than the [national average](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States&fromdate=03%2F02%2F2019&todate=03%2F04%2F2019). Moreover, despite wealth of natural resources, these states have seen substantially lower rates of growth than the national average. These disparities are especially striking that many mines are located in adivasi or indegenous lands. The adivasi populations of the region are consistently at the bottom of these impoverished societies, and see few of the benefits of mining. It has been estimated that mining led development has displaced [lakhs ](http://indr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/B.-Terminski-Mining-Induced-Displacement-and-Resettlement.pdf)of people.

While Naxilte rebellion has lost power over the last 8 years, the underlying roots of the conflict have not been addressed.

India's coal industry has consequences that extend well outside of India. India is forced to rely upon coal imports as Coal India has failed to met [demand](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-expects-india-coal-imports-to-hit-record-1557467616076.html) in India. India imported $25 billion of coal in [2018](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c%7c%7c%7c%7c2701%7c%7c%7c4%7c1%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1), and is projected to become the largest imported of coal in the world in 2019.helping keep mines in West Virginia and Australia open. More important is the Indian coal industry on global climate change. While India is still taking [part ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news)in the Paris Accords, it has made promises of only modest cuts because coal is so central to its development strategy. To be clear, India is investing massively in solar and wind power. Total installed capacity of wind power has more than [quadrupled ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country)over the last decade in India, and 5.4% of India's electricity comes from solar power, a proportion more than [double ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country)that of the United States.

While per capita carbon emissions are well below the global average, carbon emissions are increasing at a rate over 6% a year. Reconciling India's need for development and environmental concerns will be vital for fighting global warming.

India's coal industry is highly inefficient, a poor engine for raising standards of living, and dangerous to the planet. Nevertheless, the coal industry remains vital to the future of India's economy. Coal fueled the industrial revolution in 18th century England, the rise of America in the 19th century, and the spectacular growth of China in the 20th. Coal is likely to similarly, for better of for worse, likely to play the same role in the development of the Indian economy in the 21st century.

",-0-1-," Thanks!! [deleted] Good job. Thanks for sharing OP. This needs to be upvoted more. holy cow...i'll have to tldr.
This is what's gonna happen when you pair poor computer literacy, lazy programmers, old cyber infrastructure , fake pateriotism and lack of will for security of public.  We need a wikipedia page for AAdhaar leaks . There are so many of them .  [removed] Thanks a lot man. I have such links just in case I need to slap something my friends with and I don't have it. Having so many of them on a topic at one place is a lot of help. 

Someone should make a list of all fuck ups of modi.  God damn. fuck.   How can I help? I am an experienced web developer.

Perhaps an interactive site or forum or both. People might like to explore this too: r/antiaadhar had to scroll 5 times to get bottom of this! That's a lot of work.
Thnx brah Thanks, this is much needed. Aadhar is being misused by the govt in big way. Does anyone maintain a google drive to store all news articles related to adhaar? Saved Wow ! Top quality content OP! this should be stickied Holy fuck!! [removed] cool Articles can be deleted from websites, no?

We should save it as PDFs! Yes thank you man. This is just what I was thinking about that if someone ever asks for proof about shittyness of Aadhar, this is it. Even the UIDAI would shut their mouths. You the real nigga! 🤘🏻 Nice u/-0-1-

 OP, add this map too

Thank you for this social service.

May the blinds see it clear. Is there a way to make this list so that it is  the headlines  hyperlinked to the website. Will make the list more shareable online that way as it will be more readable. I only know of a manual way to do it. Ok",2018-03-25 15:03:38

**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big
Belt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much
wailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is
practically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that
dozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of
their governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government
deliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as
stubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.

Well, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign
policy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on
grounds that are both principled and realist.

The government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-
articulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that
""connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility
to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;
balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;
transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to
help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local
communities."" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the
path of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-
initiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were
clearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the
sustainability issues involved.

While India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it
is not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The
Guardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the
resolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental
reasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of
""isolation"" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign
up to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India
is the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the
subject, and of that we can be proud.

Let's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take
advantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free
country and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian
manufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by
China, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.
It is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what
OBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own
position in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will
not, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in
particular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on
infrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS
Bank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.
This is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently
violate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would
fail to uphold.

This is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has
taken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In
almost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of
Manmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in
such matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the
Singh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's
sensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:
Beijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's ""core
interests"". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to
the Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-
II, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact
with Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would
also have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit
from the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's
sensitivities.

By taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi
has done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand
on a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.

There are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is
essentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and
economics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a
leader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an
alternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-
driven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's
America turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free
movement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles
everywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.

And second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this
regard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which
serve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries
and economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,
Singapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.

Modi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning
to deliver. He must keep going.

ORF is Mukesh Ambani sponsored think tank. ###lol, we lost one of our closest ally, Nepal to them [Nepal joined OBOR] and this guy thinks that Modi has made us proud. In reality this is a huge disaster of our foreign policy.

**For the ignorant folks here, countries which have already joined OROP are:**

Nepal,Srilanka,Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar,Maldives  What happened to you NDTV ? Even you started praising Modi. Sad!! 😔 Good choice of picture, in what culture is pointing your finger like that to another guy not considered rude?  Indian first did not attend the conference then invented a reason.

Policy/Economy,"Cashless economy is a boon, says Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus",84,5mivsr,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Cashless-economy-is-a-boon-says-Nobel-laureate-Muhammad-Yunus/article16994985.ece,72,,indianpolicy," Of course it is,  but you need to first provide basic electricity and Internet and educate the masses before aggressively adopting it.  That's like saying calculus is very important and forcing children to learn it without teaching them algebra.  Even Muslims are turning into Modi agents. Their bhakti knows no bounds. /s this can not b digested by modi bashers A cashless economy is the ONLY way to win the war on black money.  Demonitization attacks stores of existing cash and forces people to learn new methods of payments.  But in the long term, it is only when the government can track each and every transaction that a person makes at the click of a button that the capacity to generate future black money will be drastically reduced.  (and yes, I'm ignoring other benefits of cashless economy such as lack of printing/storage/productivity wasted by getting and storing cash, etc)

Of course he is going to say cashless economy is a boon - Any economist who says going cashless for is bad is a fucking moron. Cashless economy is a boon however shoving it down people's throat by a democratic government isn't. The large majority of those bearing the brunt of demonetization policies are precisely the ones that aren't paying their legal share of taxes regardless of the infrastructure and systems that do facilitate their livelihoods. We live in a country where tax administration only reaches a small fraction of the population.

I'm not accusing them, I'm merely stating a fact. Having lived income-tax-free for decades means they've paid less than their expected share toward national interest. Subsequently having to change money and lose a sum in the transaction one day, or having to suffer the inconvenience of setting up a bank account isn't an unreasonable consequence. 

Many of them are poor but taxes are in some sense an investment for our peoples' future; having a functional society or lift hundreds of millions from poverty will require a budget. Generally speaking, we can have a drawn-out process of social and technological modernization and prolong poverty, or we can do more in shorter order with more resources. This is not something to be contested, this is all obvious, yet people will waste time arguing even the most basic logic.

We should be as creative as we can in our solutions to mitigate the costs of modernization. But there are few low-hanging fruit that will effect meaningful reform on national scale. It is true, one such demonetization even will not break the effect of black money on India; but as one piece of commitment to a multi-pronged, long-term strategy, we can make it work.

The key has to be that someone does something. Government in India often does not meet even this most basic requirement with respect to facilitating our social or technological development. We can argue day and night about everything, always starting from square one, always starting from the most basic philosophical assumptions, but we're guaranteed nothing will change if nothing is attempted.
Perhaps Modi has not done everything he could or should, maybe we can question his motives all day and night, but he has begun doing something, taking some calculated, novel risk, to produce national momentum. He has justified his own salary in some small way.

**It’s time Modi government stopped blaming RBI**

Overall, the Narendra government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Photo: PTI

Before the six-member committee that sets monetary policy for the Reserve Bank of India met this week, the government in New Delhi made its preferences very clear. Two members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic advisory council—a body that he did without for a long time, but which was recently reconstituted following several policy stumbles—publicly declared that real interest rates were too high. But the RBI committee held firm and kept India’s policy interest rate at six percent.

This could have been, and was, predicted. India’s central bank is now officially supposed to be targeting consumer price inflation and nothing else; the government agreed to this change over a year ago. And inflation has been inching up, driven by higher prices for food and fuel. In October, consumer price inflation was the highest in seven months.

Formal requirements apart, of course, it would’ve been hard for the central bank to ignore the government’s pleas if the economy were stalled. But the government achieved something of a victory last week when GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017 came in at 6.3%, slightly faster than in the first quarter. That eliminated pressure on the RBI to cut rates and stimulate investment. Instead, the central bank’s priority is guarding against the possibility that higher growth will begin to affect wages—and, in particular, real estate prices, which the RBI singled out for attention in its policy statement.

This illustrates the government’s great dilemma. Growth in India never quite slows down enough to make crisis measures necessary. Yet it never quite speeds up enough to satisfy the aspirations of Modi, his party and his voters (not to mention his critics). The couple things the government has gotten right in the past few months—its attempts to streamline the new goods-and-services tax and its determined approach to cleaning up distressed assets—haven’t been dramatic enough either to ease the RBI’s worries or to push the economy to a permanently higher growth path.

Overall, this government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Now it’s clear that the RBI won’t bail it out; the best chance for lower rates may have passed. Any revival of private investment—which, as a proportion of GDP, was even lower in the second quarter than the first—will have to come from somewhere else.

Frankly, if the government is serious about a growth revival, it will have to return to the drawing board. It still has time and political capital to spare before it has to face the voters in 2019. There is an entire set of reforms that it hasn’t touched since its first few months in power: to India’s problematic labour markets, for example, or to the ways available to industry and developers to acquire agricultural land.

Recently, India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, insisted that India would become a $10-trillion dollar economy by 2030. That would mean moving toward double-digit growth in dollar terms very soon. Yet there’s no indication of that on the horizon. Frankly, the signs to me aren’t propitious. While the growth slowdown may have reversed, part of that was simply a dead-cat bounce. Manufacturers who had stopped production to de-stock before the introduction of the new GST started up again in the second quarter. That’s hardly sustainable.

Nor is the government capable of intervening itself to prop up growth. In fact, it’s running out of money to keep stimulating the economy: It has already run through most of its fiscal deficit cushion for the year, and the RBI flagged the fiscal stresses caused by higher pay for government employees and Indian states’ mad competition to forgive agricultural debt. Nor are there really any signs, even anecdotally, of renewed investment in India’s private sector.

It’s hard to see 6.3% growth as a major achievement in India. As the RBI pointed out, it’s not a disaster. But, if the government is honest with itself, it’s not a triumph either. It’s time that Modi, his ministers and his advisers turned to the many reforms they’ve left pending—and stopped blaming the RBI. Bloomberg View

So they're admitting there is pain? What happened to ""fastest growing economy, look at the facts, etc.""? Why temporary pain for a common cold? Is it a viral flu now? It's scary that they don't even have to defend anything anymore. Just keep brainwashing people under the false pretense of ""long-term gains"" and they are all set for the next big disaster. Their arrogance keep increasing as they are winning more elections. The problem is everybody is sure about the 'pain' part but nobody is confident there will be any 'gain' in future.

**Have to take temporary pain for long-term gain: VP Venkaiah Naidu on economy**

Venkaiah Naidu said that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned. (File photo) Venkaiah Naidu said that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned. (File photo)

At a time when the Narendra Modi-led central government is battling a public perception of economic mismanagement, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on Friday threw his weight behind the present dispensation and said the country has to face temporary pain for long-term gain.

“The temporary things… there will be some problem. Of course, you have to take temporary pain for long term gain. I am not getting into this arena. There are other people who are debating, using their skills, forgetting what they have done, what has to be done, what needs to be done,” Vice President Naidu said.

The Vice-President also stated that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned.

Maintaining that even China is witnessing a slowdown in its economy, Naidu said that the global economy has slowed down and added that India remains a bright spot”in the midst of this”.

His reaction comes days after senior BJP leader and former finance minister Yashwant Sinha launched an attack on the government over handling of the economy. Sinha in his article in The Indian Express had blamed Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for the “mess” in the economy. He wrote that the economy is in a downward spiral, its revival unlikely by the 2019 elections and a “hard landing appears inevitable.

Later in the day, at a book launch event in New Delhi, Naidu talked on several issues. On terrorsim he said, “Terrorism has no religion, caste, creed.”

He further said, “Religion is used to mislead the younger generation, we should be wary of this. We should educate and enlighten people on evil effects of terrorism, how much it costs. Every country should speak in one voice. Political parties within the country also should speak with one voice, they shouldn’t try to score brownie political points.”

Naidu said, “Bullet can never bring change. If even if it brings change temporarily, it will not sustain. It is the ballot which is powerful than bullet in democracy, that has been proven. The society should discourage acts by people taking to arms and then trying to achieve there state political goal.”

Policy/Economy,Booster shot for economy: GST rates to be cut on 60 goods and services.,91,74kzl4,http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/gst-council-set-to-ease-processes-for-smes-on-friday-2405561.html,14,,appu_or," Behn ... maslaa rate ka nahi, GST ke rule aur infrastructure ka hai. But wasn't there nothing wrong with the economy as the government insisted? Then why these changes? How many fucking changes will these clowns make? One of the big confusion going on already is regarding different tax rates for products and this is going to get a whole lot worse when tax slabs for 60 more products are changed. Then there are million other doubts regarding actual filing, refund, exports, website acting wonky, zero support from CBEC etc 

The sheer number of changes that have to be done on this half baked tax regime shows how poorly it was conceptualised and implemented. It feels as if someone who has no idea how the country's economy works sat down and came up with the garbage known as GST act. 

Mudi and Jaitley should be ashamed and issue an unconditional apology to corporate India. Shame on these chaiwalas and morons   You still have to file 3 times a month and get extremely confused as you try to figure out the rate for various good. Its been 3 fucking years since gst bill was introduced in parliament and another couple since it was proposed by UPA, why is it so fucking hard to come up with a sane and sensible taxes You know what is worse than impractical draconian rules and business breaking taxes??

Uncertainty. If the above is cancer, but Uncertainty is basically a bullet to the head. 

MSMEs don't have a legal team to go through all the everchanging rules. You motherfuckers  should understand we have other responsibilities and headaches to operate our businesses. You have all the resources one could get and still can't come up with a reasonable policy after multiple meetings.

These cunts forget that they are operating a country with 120crore people. A single bad policy essentially could be someone's death nail.

Policy/Economy,"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",6,azoh6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,3,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

[The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/yv-reddy-interview/article26489119.ece)",Avinash_Sharma, I've always liked the forest cover model of assigning tax resources to the States. It's a very esteemable initiative. [deleted] Summary ,2019-03-11 11:39:27
Policy/Economy,India not China is among the fastest growing economies,63,6ntezq,http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-china-fastest-growing-economies-world-bank/1/1004183.html,24,,aryaninvader," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. 

 ______ 
**India not China is among the fastest growing economies** 

 ______ 
The latest World Bank report about the economic health of the member countries clearly says that while India is among the fastest growing economies - big and small, China is not doing as well.

Chinese economy is slowing down. In its latest report, the World Bank has said, ""The continued gradual slowdown in China will slightly offset a pickup in the rest of the region led by a rebound among commodity exporters. Growth in China is anticipated to slow to 6.5 percent this year and 6.3 percent in 2018.""

According to the World Bank's latest edition of the Global Economic Prospects, India is the fourth fastest growing economy in the world. China shows a clear sign of slowdown and ranks at number 16 in terms of GDP growth rate.

INDIA PICKING UP

The World Bank has pegged India's growth rate at 7.2 for the current year on the back of rising export and increase in government spending.

Writing in the June edition of the Global Economic Prospects, the The World Bank analysts said, ""In India, recent data indicate an acceleration in growth, with an easing of cash shortages and a rise in exports. An increase in government spending, including on capital formation, has partially offset soft private investment.""

According to the World Bank, ""India is expected to accelerate to 7.2 per cent in fiscal 2017 (April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018) and 7.5 per cent in the following fiscal year. Domestic demand is expected to remain strong, supported by policy reforms.""

CHINA SLIPS

In terms of growth rate, India is placed behind smaller economies of Estonia, Uzbekistan and Nepal. On the other hand, China failed to secure a place in the top 15 economies in terms of GDP growth rate.

The World Bank said, that though China has shown recovery in exports and the robust consumption pattern has helped it grow at 6.9 per cent in the first quarter, Beijing's slowdown is pulling down the east Asian region. Other countries in the region are showing better growth rates.

The World Bank has also expressed concern about exacerbating financial vulnerabilities of China on account of ""elevated domestic debt.""

According to the World Bank, the policy uncertainty in the United States and Europe is likely to impact Chinese growth rate more adversely. The trade, immigration and fiscal policies of the US are under review by the Donald Trump administration.

Similarly, the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union carries financial risks that could weigh on heavily on the China's growth prospects.

Join our AMA with a CA and ask away
r/gstindia OP, last year i imported a bunch of components from U.S and saved 50% on taxes, so i kinda escaped the purge and will be safe for 2 more years. back to question, this year god forbid i feel bad for people who have to build a new pc. you guys will be paying double or even more.

here are a few reasons

crypto mining craze, its dying out but the effects will stay till 2018.

GST

40% tax on personal imports + GST. 7y months ago i got an rx480 for 14K, its 40K now I was charged 18% GTS on GTX 1050ti cost 12k and G5460 cost 5k.   gst is wrong answer its rolled in india but card prices have gone up across globe....its   because of crypto currency(ethereum) mining..jan it was near 7-8 dollar per eth then in may it went 300 dollar  which led to the price rise. High video cards  end cards like 1080 and ti  and low end 1050ti 1050 460 560   version are not affected by this ,most affected card  are amd rx 470-480-570-580  they are going for double there base price 1060 1070 is good cheap alternative thts why it has gone up but as price of eth has stabilized they have gone back to ""normal"" , u wont find amd cards easily they have been out stock nearly every where across globe.. imported items have seen massive price rise. tronsmart usb-c/qc3 powerbank was selling on amazon for around 2100 few months ago. after gst, it disappeared and only became available 2-3 days ago for 3100 rupees. anker powerport+ usb-c pd charger was selling for around 2800 bucks before gst. it also disappeared and came back for around 4500. managed to get it during a recent sale for under 3000 bucks. it is again out of stock and an alternative listing has it priced at 7999 rupees. pretty insane. no good alternatives as local manufacturers do not make good quality usb-c accessories. quantumzero recently launched a few products. amazonbasics is another good option but no power banks or chargers.  [deleted] Bhai 1060 14k ka kaha se lia? Mai Lucknow se lia tha back in September last year it cost me 19k with tax...gg Check the prices after deepawali holidays, during festive season no body wants to short sell. Taxes were always high. It's just that not all of them used to pay taxes in entirety and used to pass on some of the savings to the customers as ""discounts"". That is not happening anymore that is all. I'm not saying the price should remain that high. It should come down, I'm not sure if it will happen at MRP level or at GST level. GPUs are in high demand due to cryptocurrency mining. Hence the increase in prices.  GST toh man ka vahm hai mitron..cangress ke jamane me sab cheeje mehangi thi .../s GST It's a worldwide phenomenon actually. Graphics cards and RAM have been expensive for quite a while now.  Graphic cards are considered under luxury segment, hence their prices have surged.  Actually there is no import duties tax, but instead of that is gst. So, if it's 200$ gpu, then you gotta pay 70$ as gst and some for shipping.
Day before yesterday, I asked for gtx 1060 3gb at lamingtn, he said it's around 14k. And 6gb around 18k. Yes! I was thinking of the same exact fucking thing! WhateverTF is going on here, it's pissing me off!  RX 470 was 15k for Stock version and 19k for Dual fan back in February.

RX 570 launch price is 18k for Nitro model. 

Now its 27k. DAMN !!! Due to Gujarat Seva Tax (GST). It actually baffles me as well. I bought my old i5, 4gb ram, 1gb ddr5 graphics laptop at around 50k 5 years back and even now the shit costs same, or even costlier. Only difference is in the touch interface, everything else has remained costly. GST rates have definitely been hiked. Also customs charges seemed to go up when GST went up any idea what's gonna happen to 1080ti? Lot of factors.. First the retarded taxes because DGTL INDYA. Secondly, the chips have become costly as heck due to demand as well. Blame the smartphones.",2017-10-10 10:27:37

Jagdish Bhagwati, Pravin Krishna,Suresh SundaresanOn November 8 Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a surprise reform to the nation: the government declared that the high-denomination 500 and 1000 rupee notes, which constituted more than 85% of currency outstanding in value, would be invalid as legal tender and could only be deposited into bank accounts until the end of the year.This is a courageous and substantive economic reform that, despite the significant transition costs, has the potential to generate large future benefits.



This is a courageous and substantive economic reform that, despite the significant transition costs, has the potential to generate large future benefits.India is largely a cash-driven economy, though a rapidly growing percentage of the population is becoming tech savvy. A shadow economy reliant on cash transactions and evading taxes, especially on high value transactions such as real estate purchases, gold, and intrinsically illegal activity, has taken deep and highly persistent root. Counterfeiting of Indian rupee notes and their subsequent use in funding of terrorist activities has also been an important concern.

Undertaking this reform has required the political courage to impose predictable transition costs on the economy to lay the foundation for sustained future benefits – the converse of what one normally expects from one’s politicians.

This is incorrect, as the policy allows for the exchange of old notes for new notes. Although the process is inconvenient, and subjects many households to hardships, it forces the cash from the black economy to be deposited into the banking system, potentially increasing transparency and expanding the tax base and revenues to the government from taxes and surcharges.

The argument that the policy is anti-poor is suspect as a significant fraction of the taxes and surcharges that will be collected from the reform initiative is to be allocated to social programmes.

On the contrary, this action has been taken by duly elected officials within the framework of a democracy.To be effective, the policy required an element of surprise. Given this surprise factor and the magnitude of the reform, the rollout of the policy has generated predictable hardships.The shortage of new currency notes and limits on withdrawals has led to considerable anxiety about wage and pension payments, and cash financing of even routine household expenditures. The frequent changes in rules during the past month, over how money deposited into accounts will be taxed, how much money may be withdrawn and which exemptions would apply, for instance, have led to unnecessary confusion.

This move is hoped to motivate the transfer of wealth from the black economy to the banks.

Several recent developments suggest that the demonetisation drive may well yield significant benefits.First, around 80% of the currency in higher denominations has now been deposited back into bank accounts. Since individual deposits will now be matched with their tax returns and unaccounted deposits will be taxed, this will yield a windfall for the government permitting large increases in social expenditures.

Thus, this one-time demonetisation itself could have long-term beneficial impact by nudging reluctant consumers into e-payments, whose transparency will ensure greater tax compliance and a higher permanent tax base.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


",unfitforoffice," Wow. TLDR? [deleted] [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. 
 >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. 

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

As I've been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides, accepting English IS decolonization. Glad to see an academic agree. I can drink his urine straight from source Brilliant. Learned a lot about myself and my country...  Brilliant article. Its important to see good arguments from both sides. Thanks for sharing.",2017-09-11 19:45:04

In contrast, the second generation of Asia's leaders, such as Singapore's first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, saw the merits of the West but also its pitfalls and drew upon their own cultures, with startling economic success.

More Indians than Americans are online these days, just behind the number of users in China, but that looks more impressive than it is. Only 13 out of 100 rural Indians have Internet access.

If all transactions are taxed, we will get a lot of tax money . 

Now we don't really have sufficient money to build infrastructure, and with money we can do now.

Some people complain that the poor people are in trouble, farmers are standing in a queue, no money to pay factory workers.

I just want to know where was your sympathy, when farmers were committing suicide and factory workers are underpaid. We may have to face a reduced GDP growth this year, things will be better next year.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",sultanatehere," Ohh pls...

Policy/Economy,Economics. That is why I support the BJP / NDA.,137,2ta4um,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2ta4um/economics_that_is_why_i_support_the_bjp_nda/,156,"Every second day there is a thread on ""Why do educated people support that fount of communal poison the BJP"". Instead of all of us endlessly circle jerking over subjective stuff, I wanted to take a slightly different approach and put forth some key macro economic indicators that compare data from NDA I era and the UPA I & II regimes. I even plotted graphs on an excel, but imgur won't allow me to upload excel graphs and I have no idea how to upload these onto Reddit otherwise, ideas welcome. Also how does one make tables on Reddit? Copy pasting from excel again does not work.

**The Data** -

Indicator	        NDA	     UPA I	       UPA II
Agriculture    2.78%	    3.07%	       4.10%
Industry	      5.80%	    9.10%       5.10%
Services	      7.60%	    9.90%	      8.09%

On GDP growth rates, nothing much to choose from though the UPA seems to have done well across all sectors, as to how this wa achieved, I will cover it a little later.

Indicator	NDA	UPA I	UPA II
CAD	3.40%	-13.12%	-56.58%

On CAD, the UPA performance looks horrible, one could attribute increasing oil prices (it touched a peak of $ 100 a barrel) to a certain extent, but it is only a portion of why the CAD went down so horribly.
 
Indicator	        NDA	UPA I	UPA II
Inflation WPI	4.58	5.9	         7.08
Inflation CPI	3.86	6.04	10.18

Inflation seems to have been horribly mismanaged by the UPA, and this is largely due to deficit financing and pumping in huge funds into the rural sector in the form of MNREGA. The MNREGA was in the larger picture actually bad for the intended recipients as it drove up prices over and hurt the economy as a whole.

Indicator	       NDA	UPA I	UPA II
Fiscal Deficit	3.8	30.86	76

Again, how did the UPA achieve the funding of such profligate schemes such as MNREGA or the Food Safety Act or the loan waiver? By deficit financing. It essentially spent more (which govts usually do) more than what it earned. This also has the side effect of fueling inflation.

And now we come to why I believe even these numbers are illusionary,

Absolute Increase in Employment (mn)	NDA	UPA
Agriculture	                                              21.25      -15.71
Manufacturing	                                              11.72	-7.23
Non Manufacturing	                                        9.11	26.14

Total	                                                       60.85	2.72

The net jobs added by the NDA in 10 years as compared to the UPA in 12 (data for 2013 on was not available)  is not even comparable and this is why I believe the UPA growth was an illusory / jobless growth.

Factor in the 10 million unemployed people hitting our workforce every year and it is imperative that as a nation we find jobs for all of them.

Another factor I would have liked to compare but as data is not available prior to 2008 I will leave it out of scope but just mention it. This is the indicator of Gross Fixed Capital Formation in infrastructure. The NDA as well know focussed a lot on infrastructure, roads and the highway network being chief amongst these. The NDA added more roads in 5 years than 30 years of other governments combined. Without the govt massively investing in actual infrastructure, job creation and economic growth is going to be difficult to manage.

This is not new either (the UPA mismanagement), Indira Gandhi did pretty much the same thing. She created an import fueled bubble of illusory growth that broke very quickly and fueled massive inflation. *Windows of Opportunity: Memoirs of an Economic Adviser by Krishnaswamy* goes into detail into how Indira almost wrecked the national economy by recklessly devaluing the currency and sending inflation soaring to 75% in the late 60's. Indira also established the trend of a socialistic economy (not her father, who piloted a Mixed economy) by ruthlessly nationalising every industry from coal to banking to wheat and imposing draconian restrictions on the private sector. Indira ALSO failed to focus on infrastructure, and during her first regime, cut down on investment in infrastructure.

After Nehru who did very well to guide the Indian economy given his set of challenges, every succeeding Gandhi dynast has been an absolute disaster for the national economy. 

The problem is, the Gandhi / Congress way has now caught on and almost every major party follows the same dead approach of populsim, throwing sops during election time and forgetting about even basic economics.

**Subjective opinion**- In BJP I see a party that is serious about building up infrastructure, that is serious about creating jobs, that while populist, marries this populism with a sense of pragmatism. It is arguably the only party right now that sees merit in manufacturing as being the workhorse of the Indian economy. I see how the BJP method has worked (relative to India of course) in places like Chatisgarh, MP, Gujarat, Goa. Yes, it has failed in Karnataka, yet it has the resilience to learn and apply lessons and not just throw up some dynast scion to continue the same tired old politics.

Sloganeering, empty tokenism and sops all won't work without some hard reforms, and this is something the BJP has an established track record in and this is why I support the BJP.

Edit 1 - Somebody please tell me how to draw tables or upload graphs here. The post looks messy without tables.

Edit 2 : Thanks /u/i_am_sam for the gold.

I am going to leave the tables as they are as some kind Redditors have done the work already.

edit 3 - The damned graphs. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/HQpsR)",Podaaaanga," **I formatted all the tables. (Thanks VIM!) Anyway, copy it to your post and I will delete the comment.**


Every second day there is a thread on ""Why do educated people support that fount of communal poison the BJP"". Instead of all of us endlessly circle jerking over subjective stuff, I wanted to take a slightly different approach and put forth some key macro economic indicators that compare data from NDA I era and the UPA I &amp; II regimes. I even plotted graphs on an excel, but imgur won't allow me to upload excel graphs and I have no idea how to upload these onto Reddit otherwise, ideas welcome. Also how does one make tables on Reddit? Copy pasting from excel again does not work.

**The Data** -

Indicator             | NDA          | UPA I          | UPA II
----------------------|--------------|----------------|-------
Agriculture           | 2.78%        | 3.07%          | 4.10%
Industry              | 5.80%        | 9.10%          | 5.10%
Services              | 7.60%        | 9.90%          | 8.09%

On GDP growth rates, nothing much to choose from though the UPA seems to have done well across all sectors, as to how this wa achieved, I will cover it a little later.

Indicator   | NDA     | UPA I     | UPA II
------------|---------|-----------|-------
CAD         | 3.40%   | -13.12%   | -56.58%

On CAD, the UPA performance looks horrible, one could attribute increasing oil prices (it touched a peak of $ 100 a barrel) to a certain extent, but it is only a portion of why the CAD went down so horribly.

Indicator              | NDA     | UPA I          | UPA II
-----------------------|---------|----------------|-------
Inflation WPI          | 4.58    | 5.9            | 7.08
Inflation CPI          | 3.86    | 6.04           | 10.18

Inflation seems to have been horribly mismanaged by the UPA, and this is largely due to deficit financing and pumping in huge funds into the rural sector in the form of MNREGA. The MNREGA was in the larger picture actually bad for the intended recipients as it drove up prices over and hurt the economy as a whole.

Indicator               | NDA  | UPA I   | UPA II
------------------------|------|---------|-------
Fiscal Deficit          | 3.8  | 30.86   | 76

Again, how did the UPA achieve the funding of such profligate schemes such as MNREGA or the Food Safety Act or the loan waiver? By deficit financing. It essentially spent more (which govts usually do) more than what it earned. This also has the side effect of fueling inflation.

And now we come to why I believe even these numbers are illusionary,

Absolute Increase in Employment (mn)| NDA        | UPA
------------------------------------|------------|----
Agriculture                         | 21.25      | -15.71
Manufacturing                       | 11.72      | -7.23
Non Manufacturing                   | 9.11       | 26.14
Services                            | 18.77      | -0.48
Total                               | 60.85      | 2.72

Don't forget the 2nd alighment row without which it will not render it as a table.

E.g.

Agriculture | 2.78% | 3.07% | 4.10% 
Industry | 5.80% | 9.10% | 5.10% 
Services | 7.60% | 9.90% | 8.09% Without any doubt NDA One has done tremendous job. But common man don't understand economics so Atal Ji lost the game second time. You can take screenshots and post graphs.

Good effort. People who can see beyond free water, wifi know that BJP's economic policies are much better than the populism of COngress and freebies of AAP. >  I even plotted graphs on an excel, but imgur won't allow me to upload excel graphs 

Take a screenshot (Alt-Printscreen on a laptop/PC). That will put the graph on the clipboard. From there you can either directly paste it to imgur or edit it in PaintBrush or something and then paste it to imgur. Inconclusive in my view. Time is the best judge, can't really compare the post 90's era this simplistically.   
There was massive growth and movement in the mid to late 90's because the level from which things started was so low.  
Congress being a historically Center Left party has always had socialist tendencies. It chose to use the funds to give freebies to the section which was less developed/vote banks, etc at the expense of pumping that money into sectors such are infra, R&D, Health, etc.   

India is not rich, in the mid 00's India's entire GDP was less than US's Defense Budget. It can't spend or use its money on everything, it has to prioritize. Congress choose what it did. Only time will tell how right or wrong they were when compared to what comes after them.  


Current Govt' will also have to prioritize because India while no longer equal to US's Defense Budget numbers, is still pretty poor in terms of its revenue so it can't just pump money into everything and make things everywhere right, that is just not going to happen.

Something like this will appear. Replace the placeholder text with your own. No doubt UPA did not manage the finances properly but the inflation during UPA1 was also partly due to the prevailing market conditions where in RBI had to go for OMO purchases which in effect led to inflation. RBI reportedly bought bonds close to 6lac crores during the period 2008-2013. But the indiscretion showed by UPA further worsened it. I thank Modi for one fact. I believe the brand image of India has improved quite a lot on pretty much every single field. I will believe only stats once they are out. But the improved brand image is something we can easily percieve. And that I give him due credit.

PS : I want to ask something.

>Indira almost wrecked the national economy by recklessly devaluing the currency 

Didn't China do the same thing some few years ago, to continue to keep Chinese markets competitive with India,Brazil etc in terms of manufactured products and export/import with regards to exchange rates?? Indira did the same thing no? Only her timing was completely off as there was no way it would have worked out then in our favor. But because of that, its a good thing now . I'm with Raghu Raj on this one: the fact that the BJP views manufacturing as an instigator of growth is not a plus point.  To add some context, most economies except US are struggling at the moment. There is massive QE that is holding up the US. Similar efforts are also being made in Europe, Japan and China but have so far had little success. Most currencies have lost massively against the US but INR has held up.

Brazil was considered India's peer and its economy is in the dumps. SA and Russia are struggling as well though Russia can blame some of it on its tussle with NATO on Ukraine.

In the midst of all this India stands tall. If you look at the Sensex, its been going up pretty steadily ever since it became clear that Modi was going to come to power. Oil crash has certainly helped the economy but the rise started much before that. The criticism from some sections of the society will continue no matter how Modi performs but it doesn't matter in the big picture since the majority is firmly behind Modi. The guy has the drive, confidence and ability to take our country forward. FIIs will continue to pour money in based on fundamentals.

Modi's agenda was development and we can already see solid results less than a year in. [removed] RES has table making option. use that You can make tables. Last control above the text box.

Thanks for the post. I feel the same way. The social side of BJP make me want to throw up. But on economics and defence/national security, where the degree of patriotism is actually measured, there is no comparison.

The BJP, at least so far, seem to be run by adults who understand economics, while the Congress is full, with some exceptions, of either traitors or idiots. Excellent effort, thanks for the post! 

I was a big fan of the NDA govt. because it was when I was in India and aware/interested in politics and their policies seemed to make sense. 

I'm not sure if some things can ever be quantified in your analysis (2008 recession for eg.) mostly because economics are not my forte. Also, did the sanctions that came after the nuclear tests have any effect? Great Post. I would add an economic theory angle on NDA vs UPA. There was a very public spat between Jagdish Bhagwati and Amartya Sen recently on whether Gujarat Development Model is a good one or bad.

On the Red Side is Amartya Sen who has been a proponent of improving social indicators - education, illiteracy. A bottom up approach of sorts. He reckons that once people become more skilled they will start contributing to the economy and accelerate growth.

On the Blue Side is Jagdish Bhagwati who has been a proponent of policies aimed at accelerating growth. He reckons that acceleration of growth will increase government revenues which can then be used to improve the quality of life of the peoples.

If you look at where NDA and UPA take their inspiration when it comes to economic policies then it becomes obvious that NDA is more towards Jagdish Bhagwati and UPA is more towards Amartya Sen.

It basically comes down to choose your poison. I choose NDA not because I am an economic genius who thinks one is better than the other. Its just that we have tried one and it has failed us for nearly 70 years. Lets give the other side a chance.  Here is a quick way to create tables/graphs for reddit. Create them in excel, take a screen shot, paste in mspaint [to get there, windows key -- run -- mspaint -- enter-key]. save as JPG or BMP and upload to imgur.  Firstly, great effort. Appreciate any attempt at a meaningful discussion. 

I wonder how Man Mohan Singh as FM compares to NDA I. Just making a point about looking at past performance. Its not the same people/party etc. Its just the same name. A party is a brand, I'm yet to be convinced otherwise

Not saying one should vote for UPA/XYZ or any another acronym - just saying its probably best to vote on a set of policies and measures and competent people to implement it.

For example, if there were 500+ competent people who were at the top of their fields in parliament irrespective of parties, that would give us the best chance of success (obviously also in Rajya Sabha as that's the show stopper for BJP now). Its all the other incompetent mother fuckers clogging up the pipes that are causing several generations to suffer lower quality lives. God knows there are enough competent Indians out there, we just can't seem to put enough of them into the parliament Employment rate data looks cherry picked

You seem to have only accounted for UPA I, not UPA II but labelled it UPA when you picked it up from here http://planningcommission.nic.in/data/datatable/data_2312/DatabookDec2014%20116.pdf

The data tables do not have any stats for UPA-II... let me know if you find any of them.

New Delhi: Fitch Ratings has lowered India’s economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 6.9% from 7.4% after the gross domestic product (GDP) growth “unexpectedly faltered” in the April-June quarter.

The credit rating agency said however that it expects the economic activity to accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year with the waning impact of one-off events including the demonetisation shock in late 2016 and the goods and services tax (GST) rollout in July, which had dampened growth in the short term.

“The large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets could, however, dampen the outlook for credit growth and business investment,” Fitch Ratings in its latest global economic outlook (GEO). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had last month slashed India’s GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7% from 7.4% owing to weakness in private consumption, manufacturing output and business investment.

India had posted a 7.1% growth in 2016-17. ADB pencilled in 7.4% for 2018-19, down from the earlier forecast of 7.6% in July. Fitch Ratings said the global economy has improved markedly this year and is on course to recording its fastest expansion since 2010.

India’s GDP growth at 5.7% in the first quarter (April-June), down from 6.1% in the previous year, is “the lowest outturn since early 2013, and GDP has now been cooling for five consecutive quarters”, it said. Economic activity in the quarter, it said, may have been disrupted by firms running down inventory ahead of the implementation of the GST in July.

The manufacturing sector lost steam in the quarter, growing at a meagre 1.2% year-on-year. The primary sector also dampened growth, while construction and tertiary activity bounced back. On the expenditure side, net trade was a big drag on growth, with exports decelerating sharply (after an admittedly strong January-March print) and import growth remaining buoyant (at 13.4% year-on-year).

“In light of the poor 1H17 (first half of 2017) outturns, we have downgraded our forecast for FY17-18 (year-ending March 2018) to 6.9 per cent, a cut of 0.5 percentage points compared to the June GEO,” Fitch said.

Forecasting acceleration in activity in the second half of the current fiscal, it said consumption should drive the pick-up in growth. “Motorcycle sales — a good indicator of rural household consumption — have gained strong momentum, bouncing back in July and August after having fallen sharply in 1H17. Investment is also expected to tick up in the quarters ahead, in part bolstered by ramped-up public sector infrastructure spending,” Fitch said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its policy rate to 6% in August, resuming the monetary easing cycle initiated in early 2015. “However, monetary policy loosening has taken place in the context of rapidly falling inflation, implying that the RBI’s policy stance as measured by the real policy rate has not been so accommodative,” it added.

The global economy has improved markedly this year but the current favourable mix of strong growth and highly accommodative macro policies could be as good as it gets, it said. “Our forecasts imply something of a ‘sweet spot’ for the global economy in 2017 and 2018 with above-trend growth and still highly accommodative global monetary policies. However, this is not a pattern we expect to persist into 2019 and beyond as output gaps close in advanced economies and monetary policy support is withdrawn,” said Brian Coulton, Fitch’s chief economist.

Global growth has been upgraded to 3.1% in 2017 from 2.9% in June, and 2018 growth has been upgraded to 3.2% from 3.1%.

Policy/Economy,The identity crisis of Middle India,139,63dbev,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63dbev/the_identity_crisis_of_middle_india/,185,"It is often said of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, that he was the last Englishman to rule India. The saying carries some element of truth to it. Nehru may have been born in Allahabad, but his heart lay in the Shires and Oxbridge. This showed through in his language, cultural sensibilities, and overall, the parliamentary democracy that he guided us towards. He was a towering intellect, but unlike his contemporaries who were by and large bilingual intellectuals, his writings were mainly in English. He could give a speech in Hindi, but his knowledge of the tongue ended there. His sensibilities were English and it is to his credit that being so English and upper class as he was, he could mingle with just about anyone from the classes or the masses in a country as diverse as India.

One of Nehru’s primary concerns at Independence was the building of a national identity. India, under the British, was a loose confederation of states that recognized the paramountcy of the British and its people subscribed to only a vague sense of ‘Indian-ness’ that was never formally defined. Nor was such a definition even required. The Tamil in the far south was as unconcerned with the Punjabi in the far north, as was the Bengali with the Gujarati. As far as the common man was concerned, they mainly subscribed to more or less the same set of cultural values. There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj. However, the dissolution of the British Raj also brought with it partition and all its communal horrors. The lack of a common identity between the Hindu and the Muslim tore once harmonious communities apart. Nehru and his contemporaries realized that the fabric that held this nation together was frayed at the edges and would soon tear apart. It was of utmost importance, therefore, to cultivate a common identity of Indian-ness, and suppress any alternate cultural or regional identity.

We have all been part of this identity formation, whether it took the form of singing the national anthem every morning at school, or by learning the names of various and far flung rivers of the nation. And by and large, we have succeeded. A Tamilian today cheers for “Enga thalai Dhoni”, a man from Ranchi, Jharkhand with as much fervor as the Punjabi, the Bengali or the Gujarati. A common identity has been built and there is little talk of separatism in the Indian heartland. What separatism exists has literally been pushed to the fringes of the nation and is on the verge of fizzling out itself. The political unification of India has been a success.

Culturally though, we remain as diverse as ever, and a unified identity is something that is neither attainable nor desirable. In many areas of India, language remains a prickly subject and it is quite common to hear diatribes against linguistic minorities and those who do not speak the language native to the area they stay in. However, even this problem of communication has been resolved by that great gift of Empire, the English language. If two people from any of the country’s opposite extremes were to converse, they would use the English language to great effect. Indeed, this has even resulted in an amalgamated language called ‘Inglish’ which has created a cultural identity and linguistic space of its own.

Socially too, we are as diverse and it must be said, as divided as ever. Perhaps more so in the present than at any time in the past, near or ancient. India has always had a divided society. The caste system effectively divides us into haves and have-nots, where the have-nots outnumber the haves by a large sum. The have-nots, by virtue of their numbers are at the bottom of the pyramid, and the haves are right on top. This caste based division of society is often reflected in the economic sphere as well. The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. Consequently the aspirations of the haves are vastly different from the aspirations of those at the lower half of the pyramid. This social pyramid has been the template for every society since the beginning of time. The upper classes, the middle classes and the lower classes are at various times dominant separately, but their composition remains pretty much the same. When the aspirations of one of these classes are not met, a society will experience upheaval. In the case of the lower classes, it is revolution. For the others, this upheaval takes the form of a flight to greener pastures. It is this upheaval that India is facing today.

The Indian state in the past sixty years has done a decent, though by no means complete, job of providing for the basic (and here I must stress on the word basic) aspirations of the lower rungs of the pyramid. The Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has been taken care of for many Indians. Food security was achieved quite a while ago, while our housing situation too has not been too bad. Again, I must remind the reader that there is much to be done, but there has been a good deal of coverage in this area. In the case of the better off citizen of this nation, the Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has always been taken care of. It is something else that he aspires too. These aspirations may take the form of entertainment, social standing, a certain lifestyle or even the choice of clothing. It is a matter of debate as to whether these aspirations have been fulfilled or not. Certainly, the cities of India hold all the ingredients to provide for these aspirations. And yet, it is seen that they do not and the urban youth have flocked to greener pastures abroad like migratory wildebeest. The logical conclusion in this case is that the aspirations of the urban youth have changed and these aspirations are something that Indian society cannot fulfill.

And so what are the aspirations of the urban, educated, elite of this nation? Certainly education and employment is readily available. Admission into an IIT/NIT, or barring that, an educational institute of similar standing is within their reach. A degree in Engineering guarantees every one of them gainful employment with a salary that can ensure a comfortable lifestyle. Some of them go in for a post graduate degree or diploma in management or business administration. A resume containing all this can lead to a very comfortable lifestyle with excellent prospects for any young Indian with an eye on his future. And yet, it is not sufficient to ensure that he or she does not take flight to greener pastures? What then, are the greener pastures that they aspire to?

Everyone has heard of the brain drain of the 70’s and 80’s. Educated Indians fled abroad in huge numbers, stymied by the lack of opportunities in this land. It was a great loss yes, but one could understand why they left. India in those days was in a socialist paroxysm. The license-quota-permit Raj that Nehru set up stifled creativity and business enterprise. Jobs were hard to come by in an economy with a ‘Hindu-rate-of-growth’ and as a result doctors, engineers and scientists fled this country for the US, helping to build societies there. Today however, the nation is better poised to provide employment and opportunities to its engineers and doctors. And yet, they continue to leave in droves. What then, are the opportunities that they are looking for?

Nehru tried hard to build a common identity for this nation. Today, nearly fifty years after his death, it is hard to say if he has succeeded or not. There is a political and cultural union called India. There is also a growing population of youth that hardly even identifies itself with this nation and its people and culture anymore. They identify themselves with the West. And it is in search of this identity, that they surge westwards in increasing numbers every year.

When I asked why they wished to leave this nation, I received many replies.. Some are insightful, some well thought out, and some are purely cynical and selfish, though unbeknownst to the person concerned.

One worshipper of the Western way of rational thought spoke in raptures about their technological and industrial prowess and glowingly described their plans to build a magnetically levitated high speed rail system. He noted that his own nation that had fed, housed and educated him for twenty five years was a “backward shithole that did not invent anything of note”, thus conveniently discarding the fact that it took the United States a hundred years to reach where it is now, while India is still suffering from its birth pangs.

A young lady of my acquaintance described India as a selfish, repressed society of bullies who could not be counted upon to elect a capable Prime Minister. She was “sick of the way we use age old methods that cannot be integrated into modern society, Must it be taught to even respect equally?”. She was right, to an extent. But it is doubtful if she would ever find a society that respects equally, where bullying is not tolerated and is not parochial and narrow minded in some sense. It also took all of my self control to keep from reminding her that Donald Trump has been elected to the most powerful office in the world.

The real reason, one that they are loathe to acknowledge, is that they no longer identify with the people around them anymore. Indeed, the vast majority of Indians are invisible to them and when they do make an appearance in their lives, they are disgusted and feel alienated. They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics. Fed on a relentless diet of Americana, they do not identify with Indian events, Indian characters, Indian food, drink or even other Indians anymore. The television shows they watch are American. The food that they eat is American. The books they read are American. The language they are most comfortable with is American. The news channels they are most familiar with show local American news. Indeed, they would know more about the political system of the USA than of their own nation.  The latest agendas of the latest Senatorial candidates would be on their fingertips. What would not be on their minds, is the names of their MP’s and MLA’s back home.

One of the most absurd things I have heard of in recent times is the news that a socialist has been elected to the Seattle city council. That a socialist has been elected in the USA itself is absurd enough. But what makes the news even more absurd is the fact that the candidate who campaigned on a socialist platform was an Indian who was raised in India, was educated in India, was in all likelihood a beneficiary of all the post liberalization reforms of the Government of India. Like everyone else in her generation, she would have been the first to demand reforms and the lifting of India’s socialist policies and yet, when she emigrated to the US, rediscovered the socialist in herself, because she could not bear to see the suffering of the American masses under the yoke of capitalism. It reeks of hypocrisy. Would she do the same thing in India? No. In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom. But of course, they do not even exist for her. Instead, she chose to fight for the American’s Roti, Kapada, aur Makaan, because – “ It is easier to convince 300 million literate people to vote for you, than to convince 1 billion illiterate people, never mind that they are your own people.”. There is a word to describe such people. It is ‘mercenary’. But then, what can you expect of a people who would rather celebrate Halloween to Holi?

It is easier to convince three hundred million literates to vote for you. It is far more difficult for these people to convince the one billion Indians who are their countrymen to vote for them because they do not even speak their language. Indeed, they do not even make an effort to learn their own mothertongue and identify with the rest of their society. This laziness to push themselves and achieve something points to a deeper malaise in our psyche. In other words, this generation of Indians has ‘Aspirations, but no Ambitions’. They feel apart from the world around them and would rather run away to the West than do anything about the very society that gave birth to them, but cannot satisfy their outsize American aspirations. And why would they not? They are Americans in all but name.

**TL;DR - Our urban youth emigrate because they are culturally American and do not even identify themselves as Indian anymore.**",conqueror_of_destiny," [deleted] You know what that they saying about dignity and poverty? That's a fucking lie, there is no dignity in poverty. As much as no one should be ashamed of manual labor, there is no dignity to it. We live in a country where most of the middle class is one incident away from living on the street. For all our governments talk of healthcare, its still not enough to cover any serious illness. There is no unemployment pay for the millions of young people desperately searching for jobs and educational institutions except for the rich or immensely talented have failed at delivering any qualifications or education to the masses.

As to identity, I am from the North East, plunged into an insurgency for 40+ years by incompetent Indian admistration, I barely speak Hindi, I come from such a mixed family background that I have no mother language or culture though I can speak or most of it, I hate having to stand up for nonsense like national anthems, I celebrate independence day by take a hiking trips to the wilderness, but at the end of the day I still consider myself Indian, I don't feel ashamed of it, I recognize the problems of my country and am willing to make contributions to it. There is no identity problem, people are quite aware of what it means and what it takes to be an Indian. Not everyone can handle it.

I don't envy or hate those Indians who want to leave, I understand the reasons. I don't think I would leave though. [deleted] I perfectly identify as being Indian. I consume American drivel in copious doses. I don't even know what would be a culturally perfect Indian thing; Bollywood offends my tamil brothers and I can't comprehend their jalebis. I am a nationalist and Hindi is my mother tongue but it's been more than a decade since I wrote anything in devnagri. I once nearly emigrated. I don't belive that idea of India was a British construct. I don't think the poorly educated are dumb as rhe source of Wisdom isn't just books but also experiences. I am not alone.   I think you have used instances that suit your narrative and bias and have come to your conclusion. You have not objectively analyzed anything before making a sweeping conclusion. Bhaisahab, if you want to bash American culture, atleast don't use Americanisms like ""Middle America"" mindlessly. Middle Indians are Madhya Pradeshis,Chhatisgarhi and Jharkhandi. Are you referring to them? I didnt even read your post after reading the TL;Dr cuz its outright BS

People emigrate because dollar is stronger so pay is better and the way of life thare is better Where the heck did you get this from?

No typos, text is correct, grammar is accurate, insight is spot on.

Theres a structure, and each point flows into the next.

BC, kahan se aaye ho?

Edit: Since you are getting a lot of flak.

1) Kudos, the points raised are well framed and match a lot of reality

2) Your tldr is unweildly for such a wide ranging argument, and doesnt correctly convey the same spectrum held in the larger piece. > There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj.

LOL. This is something British say to cover up their colonial atrocities and convince the world that Colonism helped India. The Idea of India existed thousands of years before British came to India. 

> The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. 

Even after caste based reservations for more than 60 years. Why does this exist? It's not like upper caste people cheat and get all the facilities or money meant for lower caste people. And, most importantly do upper caste people get anything extra from the government that lower caste people do not get? Why is the upper caste without reservation haves and lower caste people with reservation have-nots? > Our urban youth emigrate because they are culturally American and do not even identify themselves as Indian anymore.

What does identifying oneself as Indian mean ?  Came here to identify myself as Madhya Pradeshian.....left after wall of texts >They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics.

This is really true the way you put it. Forget the divide in religion, ethnicity or caste. There's a divide between people who are westernised and those that are not. A Muslim or Hindu who visits pubs, dates multiple women, talks in English, listens to English songs has nothing in common with a migrant Muslim/Hindu from Bihar.  
You can see this thin fabric of divide whenever you visit any posh or happening locality of your city. Look at the tapri wala watching party goers as a crippled child watches kids playing from his window. * Nice copy/paste

 I was half-expecting another thread on English and how it is ""destroying"" Indian languages. These types of articles are, ironically enough, always written by the same people who most fit the stereotypes of their descriptions.

You have this endless navel-gazing and insecurity complex by the English-speaking elites. It's crude narcissism at its worst. Nobody literally gives a shit about these questions except them. And they keep writing the same shit over and over, without realising that they never write anything new, just re-iterating on the same narrative endlessly. 

It's quite telling that the OP writes ""Middle India"". But this is not about middle India. Middle India is quite poor and doesn't speak English. This is the narcissism of a tiny elite which thinks it is original and speaking for the nation. It does neither.  no, i choose to remain here and trigger all the anti-liberals/anti-intellectuals/anti-secularists/hindutvavadis. it gives me great pleasure to not respect the so called ""culture"" and ""traditions"" of india and juxtapose my ""non-indian"" lifestyle on all those who have the fortune/misfortune to meet me. after all, why should i leave? i earn enough to have a comfortable life and also have enough savings and investments to fall back on.  > culturally American

thats an insult Too much generalisation here. But upvoted for the effort  I eat Samosa Jalegi, I also watch Bhai movies, but I live in Phoren.  Thank you for a good read. I don't agree with some of your points, but thank you for taking the time to articulate your thoughts in a forum where participants are notorious for attacking each other over the smallest of things.

As for me personally, I primarily moved to the US in search of better pay, and to support my aging parents. The clean air & transparent governance is a nice bonus :) After all, I did just fine without them for the first 25 years of my life. In my brief experience with Indians (my family included), people tend to put self before family before religion/community before municipality before city before state before country. To this end, the notion of identifying as an Indian is low among most people's priorities. It's fair to say that I consume a good amount of Americana, but that is because while good Indian content exists, it is buried under mountains of rubbish. I do my best to assimilate: date non-Indians exclusively, refuse to hang out with Indians that only hang out with other Indians, among other things. Moving here forced me to think of myself as a (sigh!) global citizen, but that may be as you pointed out, for lack of a real identity.

Thank you for kicking off this discussion, proofreading your text and having the balls to post to r/india. RIP. I have just this to say. You assume to know that you understand what those 'acquaintances' of yours were thinking. Their upbringing exposed them to different experiences and their perspectives were shaped because of them. They are doing their best to do what they believe in. Respect the choices made by your fellow human beings and accept that you cannot ever fully understand their perspective. They are right, and so are you. I now stand ready to be crucified by the denizens of Randia who yearn for the promised land but are held prisoner in this land most foul by ties of family, economy and society.

Edit : I demand trial by combat!  About as much logic as a WhatsApp forward, no matter how sincerely you express yourself. Singular opinions and manipulated conversations do not prove your point.  Jo Mann mein aaya woh likh dene se wo sach begin ho jata.


Nehru didn't know Hindi ? Where did you get this info from ? He has written books and letters in Hindi as well as Urdu  What is American Kucha? Someone ELI5.  I also consume Western (mainly American) Drivel. I have seen and learned from my sibling and friends. ~~They~~ We are into things which add no real value to our lives but entertainment. And entertained we are. Consumed in Western Music, movies, books, TV and pop culture and politics even. And that's okay I think. But I don't get the point of having a comic con here or celebrating Halloween and dissing our own festivals and melas.  
  
I think Education abroad has just become *Paisa Phek Tamasha Dekh* now a days. Gone are the days when you really used to go on merit basis to gain knowledge through World class education. Get the edge and real value. Now just about anyone who has grown up watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S with surplus funds from parents wants higher education abroad. It's been a trend for some time now and that trend is becoming a problem. Saturation of jobs! Both for the locals and the immigrants. Thanks to Trump that bubble is soon about to burst. I personally know people who have no business being there. They are average at studies or any other talents. Just there so they don't get crushed under peer pressure and miss having that experience of MS in US. We need to have a change in our collective thought pattern.   Very well written, extremely thought provoking. Kudos.  Well done for writing such a long post. I need to read it again before commenting as there's quite a lot to digest. TLDR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr8ljRgcJNM I view this slightly differently. Replace Americana with neoliberalism.

There is a certain strand of neoliberalism that is dominating thought processes throughout the world. It is driven by globalists. Its drivers are the ability maximize profit and move power away from nations to an international elite who belong to no country as such.

The pillars of neoliberalism are multinational corporations, tech companies and internet itself, hollywood, united nations, world bank, weapons manufacturers etc.

Economically the people who are part of this neoliberal bubble have been winning every contest so far.

People who participate in this bubble wrt USA are owners of corporations who benefit from cheap labor and market around the globe for their products.

Indian urban youth because they want to be able to work for global corporations because they obviously pay more because global corporations are more becoming more successful. They are invested in US/UK politics because their participation in the neoliberal bubble depends on it.

Political leaders who push for breaking down of national barriers for free movement of people are succeeding because they are backed by these corporations.

I strongly feel so because these neoliberals feel alien to their countrymen everywhere.

1. Hollywood/LA is accused of being eastern oriented. They follow various fads like buddism, hinduism etc that are completely alien to other Americans. Indian neoliberals are accused of being westward looking. 

2. Indian neoliberals look towards Hollywood, participate in feminism, work in tech companies etc.

3. Anti-Brexiters were accused of being globalists who were out of touch with their fellow countrymen belonging to working class.


I feel that your Seattle example fits into this. Seattle is a neoliberal hub. Its constituents are extremely intolerant to beliefs that go against neoliberalism. Other cities are NYC, London, LA, Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul, Paris etc.

Within India cities that are shining are Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, Chennai and all these cities are more integrated with the global interests than others. What you have described is ""Cultural Marxism"". Even the European countries have a problem with it. > In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom.

When one is comfortable in life, people would like to extend the area of influence. A normal selfish activity and no hypocrisy. When asked, people may under circumstances come up with rational sounding arguments.

>It is easier to convince 300 million literate people to vote for you

Human wants, needs and pleasures across literate and illiterate vary very little. Reading novels from Chetan Bhagat or Yandamuri [of telugu] are not very different. So is reading Gita and Marcus Aurelius. Or drinking in a pub or the local bhatti. Or watch a movie in Gold class or local shop. Or banging aish or local one. wearing Skynn or nirod. 

Trend is you call someone illiterate if one cannot hold a conversation with the person. This is possibly owing to our own range. In my personal experience, (of course, anecdotal) my gardener, maid and watchman have figured out things clearly and can manage their customers better than the folks I meet at office. All there of them have not passed 5th standard. There is a story that might be able to help you OP. It's a story about Odyssues (an explorer) and the Sirens. From Greek Mythology. I think it's relevant for our identity.

https://www.awesomestories.com/asset/view/Odysseus-and-the-Sirens

>Taking a large block of beeswax, a gift from Circe, Odysseus breaks it into small pieces and gives one to each of his men. He tells them to soften it and put it into their ears. In this way, they will not hear the song of the Sirens.

>But Odysseus wants to hear that famous song and still survive. Circe has told him how to do it.

>He orders his sailors to tie him firmly to the ship’s mast. When he is firmly tied, and his men have the beeswax in their ears, they row their ship alongside the island.


 Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I am one of those urban youth who emigrated to US. I think if you consider society to be people residing within the physical boundaries of a nation, then your reasoning is spot on. But if you consider a society as a community of people sharing ideas, creations, goods, services, etc., the whole world is now closer to being a single society than ever before. I appreciate all the help that this country and people offered me in my growth and I am trying to pay it forward. However, please don't negate influences from all those western ideas and people either. If it were not for them, we probably would have a hard time growing as individuals and as a country. If you take all the positive influences towards any individual and tag their origin as ""Indian"" or ""Western"", I reckon there is a significant percentage of it from ""Western"". Why then shouldn't they be ""paid back""?

I think a lot of people mistake all those folks who leave this country for greener pastures. The fact that those folks are still in touch with their friends and family back home, and that there is a constant to-and-fro communication of ideas and experiences means that they never ""left"" this society. You may not see or meet them on a daily basis but they aren't that far. It's just that some of our aspirations require us to move beyond the physical boundaries of this nation. If being Indian is about following a culture, we are all Indians. If Indian is based on location of residence, then probably we aren't. But then, we are just talking semantics. Indian physicist inventing some cool theorem in some random lab in the US is helping a random Indian as much as an Indian physicist doing the same in one of the Indian labs.  Individuals make up families, families make up communities, communities come together and make up a country. No matter what the political, social or cultural background of a country, **a country can be happy only if individuals are happy**. Iran with 5000 years of golden history, is today a failed state and Israel with 5000 years of culture, is barely propped up with American help and can collapse any day. Japan with 2000 years of culture is an American puppet state and so is Korea. 

If you think present-day youth have an obligation towards their community or ethnic race or should obey what Nehru planned for India half-a-century ago, you are putting the cart before the horse, and expecting the cart should pull the horse by itself.

Nobody (unless they go out of their way unprovoked to hate India or other Indians) have any colonized mindset just because they are interested or consume Western media. The fact is that India is no longer an isolated country, the channels of communication with the world has opened up, along with increased individual power, mobility and self-reliance. The Indian identity is simply the identity of its people, and it is a lived experience and value system of its people - and what ever we choose it to be. **To deny that would be to dismiss the life experiences and individual choices people make**, which goes against the spirit of a democracy. 

 ""Demo"" means people. The Republic of India, to which we are legally bound citizens, is a democracy, not a culturocracy. **Democracy is not merely choice of government, a democracy is choice of defining the Indian identity as we see fit.** This is a right and freedom our constitution guarantees us and and people have died and martyred and shed their blood to gain this freedom. This is dumpster-tier drivel. Never in human history have a people been so adamant on destroying their own rich linguistic history, and own languages, literally crawling over each other to adopt language of an oppressing colonial slave master that occupied their country and committed horrible genocides on them. And politicians apathetically support this.

Thus you have millions of people who have identity crisis, unsure of what to speak, stripping the very base of human civilization. They can't effectively learn or be skilled in a foreign medium forced down their throats, creating bad human capital in business terms. And they can't even get jobs if they keep speaking their own languages. They have to Ispik Ingalish so that Anglophile turds on the higher levels can be appeased, to even hope to live out.

An educated middle class's aspirations will keep changing and growing with time while the poor and the uneducated might just be happy with anything that comes from the govt. Educated middle class might even ask question and challenge the claims of the politicians while the uneducated poor will be lead like sheep.

No wonder garibi did not get removed.

Guess people who throw the word jumla for Modi/BJP forget the mother of all jumlas. Bhai the 'i' at the end of garibi was a spelling error

It was supposed to be 'garib hatao' Obviously. Anyone who looked past the 'pro-poor' rhetoric and actually looked at how India's socialist system worked could see why it couldn't remove poverty: In the name of 'equality' it concentrated all of India's resources in the hands of a small elite of government officials and chosen industrialists.

Capitalism and trickle down economics have their critics, but compared to the alternative at least there is larger overall economic growth *some* spread of wealth and benefits. Wow!

On 19 November, the Congress party kick-started celebrations to commemorate the birth centenary year of Indira Gandhi (hereafter referred to as Gandhi).

At a time when BJP is championing the image of prime minister Narendra Modi as a strong and decisive leader, the Congress party would be hoping to use Gandhi’s legacy to counter the ruling party and prime minister.

In an interview to India Today Television, Congress president Sonia Gandhi dismissed theories which equate Narendra Modi and Gandhi. While there is nothing new in the political slugfest being played out, a more interesting question is how should one evaluate Gandhi’s economic policies?

To analyse the performance of the Indian economy under Gandhi’s leadership, we have divided the post-independence period into three parts: 1952-1966, 1966-1984 and 1984 onwards. Gandhi was the prime minister from 1966-84 barring the period from 1977-1980. A simple comparison of growth rates shows that agricultural growth under Indira Gandhi’s tenure is the highest India has ever achieved. While overall growth rates have increased overtime in India, industry’s performance was the worst during Gandhi’s tenure.

In terms of per capita incomes, India started lagging behind China and southeast Asia when Gandhi was at the helm of affairs.

Gandhi’s own political rhetoric was more tilted towards providing a welfare state rather than delivering high growth, exemplified in her coining of the slogan Garibi Hatao (Eradicate Poverty). A reading of multiple Indian poverty estimates shows that poverty has declined at a much faster rate in post-reform India despite the dismantling of many of Gandhi’s policies. To be sure, there is a big debate on whether India’s current poverty lines guarantee adequate consumption and well-being levels. However, there is a broad agreement on the fact that poverty has declined faster in post-Gandhi India.

One statistic, which underlines the need for exercising caution vis-à-vis the positive picture painted by declining poverty figures is the rapid rise in inequality in India in the post-reform period. In fact, India was a more equal society than southeast Asia during Gandhi’s period. This trend has reversed itself today.

If there is one policy implemented by Gandhi which has left the most enduring impact on India’s political economy, it is the nationalisation of banks, which created a huge public sector bank network in India. The process was accomplished in two stages, first in 1969 and later in 1980.

Public sector banks have played a major role in the current problem of bad loans which plagues the Indian economy. Given the nexus between politicians controlling banks and businessmen, bank nationalisation policy is seen as a major culprit for the bad loan problem facing the Indian economy today. Public sector rigidities have also been seen as an obstacle to hiring talented executives and improving efficiency in India’s state owned banks.

However, it is also a fact that nationalisation of banks helped in furthering financial inclusion and improved access to institutional credit for people who did not have access to it earlier. Financial intermediation increased sharply in the post-nationalisation period. The state-led expansion of banking also helped in a doubling of savings rate in the economy from 10 percent in 1970s to 20% in 1980s. An increase in savings rate is seen as a crucial requirement for increasing investment and growth rate in any economy.

Caution should be observed in a mechanical reading of the statistics cited above as many policies often affect the economy with a lag. In fact, various economists have pointed towards the need to understand the complexities of political economy factors which drove economic growth in India. A 2004 National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper by Harvard economist Dani Rodrik and India’s Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian argues that the pro-business shift in Gandhi’s policies post 1980 was crucial in the growth rate picking up in the Indian economy. Similarly, a 2003 paper by Niti Aayog’s vice chairman Arvind Panagariya argues that acceleration in India’s GDP growth occurred during India’s fifth five year plan period (1974-79), while underlining the fact that growth revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s was more volatile in nature than the post-reform period.

At a time when India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, it is to be expected that the incumbent regimes would claim credit for the economic performance and dismiss the socialist rhetoric of the past of which Gandhi is an important icon.

However, it also remains a fact that despite faster growth, India stills lags behind most peers in human development outcomes.

The economic boom in southeast Asia and China helped these countries to significantly improve their human development indicators. Today, these countries are significantly ahead of India in terms of health and education levels. In fact, this gap started widening during the period when Gandhi was in power (see chart above). It remains to be seen whether a shift from Congress’s Garibi Hatao to Modi’s Cash Hatao will break this jinx.

Nearly six weeks after India abruptly scrapped high-denomination banknotes accounting for about 85% of its currency by value, the economy continues to slow. Poor and middle-class Indians are still suffering from the shortage of new bills. But the most significant casualty may well be Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reputation as a sound economic manager.

On Nov. 8, Mr. Modi announced that India’s two highest-denomination currency bills—1,000 rupees ($14.84) and 500 rupees—would immediately cease to be legal tender in most places. Holders have until the end of the year to deposit these bills into bank accounts. As replacements, the government has slowly rolled out a redesigned 500-rupee bill and a new 2,000-rupee bill.

The long-term effects of India’s demonetization gambit remain unclear, largely because no other major economy has attempted such an experiment except during a crisis. But with growth slowing and job losses rising, the short-term prognosis appears grim.

Instead of factory openings or large new investments, the images that tell India’s current economic story include snaking lines outside banks, distressed workers migrating back to their villages, and tax raids on jewelers and officials caught with hoards of allegedly illicit cash.

The policy’s shabby implementation—through an avalanche of amendments, rollbacks and patchwork fixes—undercuts Mr. Modi’s reputation for quiet efficiency. It also underscores his overreliance on India’s notoriously heavy-handed bureaucrats.

Demonetization has resurrected fears that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party takes policy advice from quacks. It damaged the credibility of India’s central bank. And it forced many of the country’s ostensibly right-of-center intellectuals to perform advanced mental gymnastics to defend the prime minister. Though a few economists have applauded Mr. Modi, the weight of informed opinion leans heavily against his decision.

Not surprisingly, shock waves from the announcement continue to crash through the economy. The Asian Development Bank cut its growth estimate for India for the financial year ending March 31 to 7% from 7.4%. JP Morgan expects growth to decline by half a percent to 6.7%.

Meanwhile, falling sales have begun to translate into layoffs spanning various sectors, including construction, textiles and jewelry. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy estimates the transaction costs alone of swapping out an estimated 14.2 trillion rupees’ worth of currency to be 1.28 trillion rupees, or about $19 billion.

India’s economy will eventually recover from this self-inflicted wound, but there’s no question that demonetization has created doubts about Mr. Modi’s competence. The decision, reportedly hatched in secret with a coterie of trusted bureaucrats, showcases the prime minister’s faith in the command-and-control ethos of the civil service rather than in the “minimum government” he once promised.

It also shows how susceptible Mr. Modi and his aides are to the unorthodox ideas of assorted cranks and oddballs from the Hindu nationalist movement to which the BJP belongs. The loudest backers of demonetization include a telegenic yoga guru, a chartered accountant best known for propounding the homespun economic philosophy of “swadeshi,” or self-reliance, and a nongovernmental organization that wants almost all taxes to be replaced by a single levy on bank transactions.

Already, a flurry of commentary by well-regarded Indian and global commentators has tarnished the prime minister’s image. The business journalist T.N. Ninan calls demonetization “a bad idea, badly executed on the basis of some half-baked notions.” For Morgan Stanley’s Ruchir Sharma, Mr. Modi’s “clumsy exercise of state power” won’t achieve its ostensible aim—cracking down on so-called “black money” salted away by tax dodgers. Kaushik Basu, a former chief economic advisor to the government of India and former chief economist at the World Bank, calls the policy “poorly designed, with scant attention paid to the laws of the market.”

To be sure, not everyone thinks demonetization is a disaster. Columbia University’s Jagdish Bhagwati calls it “a courageous and substantive economic reform” whose potential benefits include shrinking the shadow economy, hurting terrorists and counterfeiters, and expanding the tax base by digitizing many economic transactions.

Others argue that this is likely only the first of a series of reforms that will eventually simplify tax administration, root out corruption and make campaign finances more transparent. Some supporters view demonetization as a quick way to invigorate a sluggish banking sector with cheap funds.

Perhaps the optimists will be proved right, but at this point their gauzy hopes of future benefits must be weighed against the present pain. Even if demonetization ends up producing some gains, the question of whether it was worth its considerable costs will linger. Moreover, the simple fact that no credible expert suggested such a drastic policy before Mr. Modi announced it makes many arguments in its support look like belated apologia.

Two and a half years ago, based on his record as the business-friendly chief minister of Gujarat, Mr. Modi stormed to national power as India’s great economic hope. At least for now, the demonetization debacle has shaken this assumption to its foundations.

Time to bury the myth of competent Modi once and for all. Modi is totally out of his depth ffs. He's so incompetent. This is some Rahul Gandhi level shit Modi will probably start a war with Pakistan soon to distract everyone. The country’s bungling effort to cut down on cash has undermined Narendra Modi’s credibility, says Sadanand Dhume in The Wall Street Journal.

Policy/Economy,Support parliamentary scrutiny against internet shutdowns #KeepUsOnline,36,a0gvsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a0gvsw/support_parliamentary_scrutiny_against_internet/,2,"**Internet shutdowns are a growing national menace**

The internet continues to be shut down in different parts of India with increasing frequency. As stated in a[ recent op-ed authored](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-is-no-evidence-that-internet-shutdowns-work/story-4aERxaY1OMNTG8siM0iMMM.html) by Apar Gupta, Executive Director and Raman Chima, Trustee and Co-founder of IFF, published in the[ Hindustan Times,](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-is-no-evidence-that-internet-shutdowns-work/story-4aERxaY1OMNTG8siM0iMMM.html) ""*The answer has been evasion as the central government till date has refused to provide any count or centralise a reporting and disclosure system. We should not fear such data, and that such calculation may put us to shame, for even*[ *existing news reports*](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2018/india) *, India enjoys the top rank as the global leader in the number of Internet shutdowns.*"" 

This is a matter of national shame. We are losing on our rights and India's continued potential to lead the knowledge and skills economy which relies on reliable internet access. We have now started reaching out to parliamentarians on this issue. 

This continues our working model of activism where our public engagement is toward institutional outcomes. A short recap. We have through the #KeepUsOnline campaign reached out to 15,000 individual and 80 institutional signatories who petitioned the government to condemn internet shutdowns. We then followed it up with a series of RTI's which demonstrate the legal rules for shutdowns were made secretly, and most recently supported a legal analysis of these rules by one of the domain experts in the area, Nakul Nayak. 

We will continue working against internet shutdowns, meeting people, talking to them about them and ensuring India has a better rank in 2019. Do follow our updates.

**So, what is IFF doing about it?**

Next stop is parliament and we are looking towards our legislators. The dates for the winter session have been announced which commences from December 11. We sensed there was a need to reach out to the offices of various legislators in advance. As subject area experts we are attempting to set up time, talk to their offices and explain this issue to them. Our hope through such knowledge sharing and to enable greater parliamentary engagement on Internet Shutdowns in India. To enable this, two volunteers (Arpitha and Hardik) authored a brief of this issue which is now being sent across along with meetings to put this issue across to several parliamentarians.

Policy/Economy,We really need to talk about Flairs.,105,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",2017-05-15 21:21:16
Policy/Economy,The journey of India’s GDP from 1000 A.D. to 2020,54,4zc42a,http://qz.com/764352/the-journey-of-indias-gdp-from-1000-a-d-to-2020/,30,,User_Name13," In the year 1700 accounted 24.4% of global GDP. 

By 1950 we were down to 4.2% of global GDP.

And we bottomed out in 1979 with 3% of global GDP.

My beef with this article is that it doesn't even mention Manmohan Singh and completely glosses over the monumental 1991 economic liberisation reforms. Singh set the stage for someone like Modi to become PM and continue the work increasing India's share of global GDP. 

Singh had to do battle with the License Raj, before Singh did away with the old License Raj system, it was almost impossible for even an upper-middle class Indian to become a successful entrepreneur. 

My point is without Singh, you don't get a Modi.  The article is peddling the myth that Indian decline began under the British. This is a lie. India's decline *continued* under the British. India would not have been taken over by the Brits if its decline had not started earlier, thereby making it weak, thus making it easier to conquer.

Indian GDP per capita was already declining by the time the British came. [Look at the change from 1600 to 1700](http://tinyurl.com/gurlh3p).

Other than this annoying habit, the article mostly says what is obvious, India will return to its rightful place in the coming decades at the forefront of economic might. Till about 300 years ago, India accounted for more than a quarter of the world's GDP. This share began falling following the advent of British power over the subcontinent. In the past few years, though, India's economy has seen a revival and will continue to do so, a report called ""India: The Giant Awakens"" by Aberdeen...

Just look at the population share of Asia (which is basically China + India) in this chart - http://i.imgur.com/ZqJhbeg.png

Until the 18th century, it has consistently been 65 to 70% of the world share.

Look at this chart which shows the GDP share of each region - http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-20%20at%209.37.55%20AM.png and sum the India + China shares of GDP.

Until the 18th century, it has consistently been 65 to 70% of the world share.

It was only until the 1700s onwards when industrialization and colonialism started taking off that the GDP shares started diverging from the world share.

To summarize - we were never an economic superpower in the agrarian world which existed from 1000s to 1700s. In fact, it is highly unlikely we that we ever had the same position that USA does now in modern history.

**Living in denial** 

 ______ 
The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so. The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so.

Delhi’s denials of reality would be funny if it weren’t for the tragic consequences. On the economy, this denial dates back to 2012 when Manmohan Singh was in charge and Rahul Gandhi has only now underlined that unemployment was the problem. Yashwant Sinha has edited a book on The Future of the Indian Economy and documented the continuing crisis.

Employment is only a part of the story. Arvind Panagariya was more direct. The corporate sector has performed well, he said. Investment output and employment have been rising. He took averages to make comparisons, which is not good statistics for analysis of short-run changes, for if there are three numbers 5, 10 and 15, the average is 5 but there is wild oscillation. Panagariya has written a good book on the Indian economy but he is not a great statistician. His use of averages to force the argument that the blip last year and this year will be reversed is flawed. Fortunately, his successor, Rajiv Kumar, says it is difficult but doable.

The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so. The economy decelerated and voters correctly placed the blame on the UPA government and voted it out. Rahul Gandhi is absolutely correct in accepting the mistake on behalf of the then ruling party and saying that it needs to be corrected. Panagariya is too good an economist to ignore the non-corporate sector and its importance in the economy when the corporate sector is less than a tenth of the economy. In terms of output and employment, the non-corporate sector is important because jobs are created there. But for the sake of debating points, the fact that the national accounts data doesn’t show a rosy picture and includes performance of the non-corporate sector, was slurred over. Yashwant Sinha has also started a debate and in a piece in these columns established that the reversal of the slowdown was simply not there.

S. Gurumurthy had the courage to say that since Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s days, employment has been on the back burner. Half a problem is solved if a mistake is admitted and an amendment is made. But the empire struck back. On Rahul, a commentator close to the establishment said that speeches in America won’t matter in eastern UP. Another said that Berkeley and the Ivy League schools don’t matter. I went to the University of Pennsylvania, and also taught there, including at Wharton and Swarthmore College. Working as I do in Gujarat from 1968, I hold the motel owner-NRIs in high esteem. Many are engineers and so on, who went into motels since other options were not there when they settled in America, and being intelligent and well-trained, made a success of them. But the Ivy League and the professional crowd is also important, have strong connections at home and their opinion is respected in India. In fact, they remain more often than not more connected with India than the motel NRIs and so should definitely not be ignored.

Sinha asked the beleaguered establishment to get back to the drawing board. One commentator strangely argued that he was wrong because real rural wages have been rising. Abhijit Sen, now back at JNU, had pointed out a decade ago that the rural wage rate is rising but unemployment is there in a big way. This conundrum needs to be worked on rather than being wished away. Another commentator was to argue that imports are rising so Sinha must be wrong, but we are a continental economy. A senior minister could only abuse Sinha; strange since the finance and planning ministries have been known for their professional stance.

One can only hope that the policy response will be more professional. The so-called stimulus package should not just give us lectures on reform. Someday, we will get to one or maybe two rates and have a real GST, which then, after six months, will start working. Until then, we can call it a GST but with five rates it’s not unlike a sales tax. Some day, the demonetisation effects will wear off. Also please don’t end it all by telling the ministries to spend more efficiently based on existing financial allocations. If reports are correct, the captive secretary saying ‘yes sir’ must have gone out sniggering.

Efficiency doesn’t improve by lectures. Assuming that working styles will remain more or less the same, design a real stimulus. If you do your job and raise demand, the economy will respond magnificently.

   Damn it,guys,sorry for the long rant,Baccardi Limon is gold.

   Edit - statistic.
 
   Edit 2  -thanks for the gold kind stranger,it would have been great you know if you would have just up voted my post,and give that gold amount to some disabled folks in your vicinity,yes I have used the term 'disabled'.

   Now you may ask which disabled people you are talking about,I am talking about those who are most affected with this system of ours,for example while I was in my E-Resource of college there was this lady sweeping through the floor,you can literally see the broom movement expressing her grief and her dis-interest,at that time I was on some thread on this sub reading a comment by some guy on how worse is the situation of the lower rung class of the economy the workers.
   
   I thought why not just take a Rs 10 out of my purse and hand it to her,I know the amount was not big,but that's the best I could have done since I was running short of money as well,meanwhile the old lady just burst out with tears,its like she was going through a anxiety drive in her mind and suddenly this gesture of mine struck hard on her she took the Rs 10 note and said how bad the situation was for her that the college management gave her the month salary of mere Rs 1500 and that too on Rs 500 notes,the expression with which she told me sent a shiver down my spine,I was in existential crisis for a span,so much we have as a humans,so much tech,with the given advancements,the basic necessities for every individual of the earth can be covered,I started questioning the universe,how a Rs 10 note is a gram worth of weed for me but a vital sum for the under-privileged.
   
   the gold will provide me with me with less ads,better themes and shit-ton of other features,but the same amount will fill the light in some low rung homes,I am not trying to criticize this good gesture of yours but it would be cool if you find some under-privileged folk and provide them with necessities worth the gold,I can manage with ads and white theme,just my 2cents.

What does this have anything to with us being a Banana Republic?  > Where Sonny Leone is more famous than Sergio Leone

You've gone too far You've said it like it is, OP. Our country looks pretty fucked up, down and sideways. I agree with you on what you've said about our situation here, but, you know, every country has their fair share of problems. Sure, we might just be at the deeper end of the pond, but crying about it isn't really gonna help much, is it. I get that we need to take a second to vent sometimes, but it doesn't really help, imo, and it's all most of us tend to do. The thing is, i think we're just stuck right now in this weird limbo because of the crazy technological and cultural gap that's come about between the last few generations.

I really think we have a lot of potential in this country to get places. It's just that peoples' mindsets have gotta change a little. If we start thinking together as a country, to get our shit together and start doing stuff for our collective good, i think we could do some crazy stuff, bro. The every-man-for-himself-ness has gotta go away. To everyone harping about us becoming a banana republic... The definition of banana republic for your reference: ""a small state that is politically unstable as a result of the domination of its economy by a single export controlled by foreign capital""

I have a very simple solution.  We live in a democracy.  So if you want the system to change, you have the power.  If you can't change it, either accept it or get out.  Stop giving bullshit analysis and coming to incorrect conclusions.  >Where there are no passport centers in TIER II cities and you have to visit the near capital as well as pay a bribe to get a passport which will take a Bureaucratic unit of time to get processed and then you have receive it post office with again a bribe.

 
Im not sure about other states but here in Telangana, there are Passport seva kendras (PSKs) even in tier III cities as well (Nizamabad and Karimnagar for example). Where educated people (like OP) can't break down a problem (his/her list) into root causes & the only adjective used to describe the scale of the problem is ""biizzare"" OP forgot few more though...

Where stars gets all adulation /money and become superstars because of majority but when get caught or have trouble bring up the religion card or intolerance.


Where people self proclaim themselves as secular and still don't do anything to uplift minorities but just keep them as vote banks.

Where people cry about freedom of speech loudly but doesn't allow a single bit of criticism of themselves.


Where certain people are kept in God mode even though millions of corruption happened under their nose.


Where certain politicians just throw accusations but never feel the need to prove anything as their bhakts never believe anything against them.

Where feeling proud for certain religion is treated as treason just because it's majority.


Where all the corruption will suddenly vanish if you aligned with certain uncorrptibles.


Where JNU unkils proclaim themselves as intellectuls and smarter than common man.

Where 50 year olds declare themselves as youth icons and bhkaths blindly believe them.

Where you can order police to search for your lost buffaloes.




PS: how the hell people type so much ? You are Tyler Durden of me. Ours is also a country where Prison is not a ""for profit"" institution, where health insurance is not mandatory and people can still afford healthcare. It is also a country where student loans are cheap and you can get a degree if you toil. It is also the country where women have the full and final say on abortion. A country where people do agree on things like Pappu isn't leadership material. A country where people don't love their guns more than their neighbors. Its also a country where democracy is alive and kicking.

What we may need to do is think about putting country before our own interests. However bleak the reality may appear the endeavor to make things better for one and all should be greater than anything. 

Paradise is a myth.  Grass will always appear greener on the other side. You can not sort issues in your own house by focusing on someone else's household.

You know what OP. A lot of what you have mentioned has stopped bugging me over the years. What really gets me though is the way we treat the most downtrodden and the least fortunate ones in our society. It's as if we are forgetting about them with each passing day.

The raddiwalah who used to pick newspapers from our house is jobless and earning his living through begging from people he knows. He sent his daughter to the best school in the city but alas with all the demonetization crap he really can't afford it now. The girl's schooling will go on with other's mercy. A small businessman I know can't pay his employees. Yet, our prime minister did something. Our supreme court thinks he is not culpable and passes orders which will make us more patriotic.

You just proved it. Should not have read it at this hour. Bc coming to NSP Metro station this morning,I felt so disgusted. This is one of the posh areas of Delhi and all I could see between metro and my office was shit on the footpath, wrappers on roadside, people sleeping on the road, the road that has not been repaired since the eternity, and that Chhola Bhatura man who never gets a dustbin for his stall.

Hey man, you forgot to add that we love to bash our country every chance we get.  Please add a scheduled tag. It's the weekly India Is Doomed-thread.  Poppycock.
a) you stop consuming the lowest common denominator fare entertainment, you cannot expect the society to change per your whim.
b) justification of terrorists' hanging is NOT logical journalism, although the national anthem fiasco has been much ado over nothing. These days Anti Hindu is dangerously quickly construed as Anti national. Again, stop consuming this type of news and it will eventually go away.
c) this may come as a surprise, but the PM never operates alone, even though that might be the image projected onto us. About the currency ban, there's a Pune group called Arthashastra who have been the ideators for the whole thing. Their interviews are available in the public domain. Also, the reason you and i don't have cash in our wallets is because people are diverting truckloads before they hit the ATMs, as is again on the news every day. Honestly, up until the whole demonetization thing, India was doing perhaps the best both socially and economically amongst major countries. The West is in turmoil right now, especially the US. You know there's something going wrong in the US when folks can't even bother getting out to vote against probably one of the worst candidates of all time. On the other hand, at least Indians are taking their democracy and their politics seriously.  Well, China had all these problems you stated (and more) and they addressed this by having a different political structure. Do you want that in India ? 

There's no other way out.  reddit-nana > Where Sonny Leone is more famous than Sergio Leone.

What grounds do your lawyer friends have? Did they copy and pass their law exams? Or are they filing cases under the (reasonably valid) assumption that Indian judges don't really care that much about the law?

 In before OP gets Vyapamed! That username, though.  This is all a farce man, I mean they'll mock it off.

Yes, please also file a case against the govt for allowing old notes from farmers and not taxing them. Normally I am against spam but I think in this case more people should be emailing them the same thing. Fucking crooked politicians Bhaiyya ji, it is all right to want to go after people with blackmoney but please don't indulge in shoot and scoot politics.

2- Not taxing does not not being asked to file return.

3 - Returns still need to be filed.

4 - This is exactly what AAP(NGOs, Temples, Churches, Mosques) do, they take SOME white money in donation, they put up a list. Then mix that white money into illegal money and delete the list from their website.

5- Still AAP has to file a return, in which they show all the money was white can use fake bills.



6 - If your lawyer friends are not stupid, ask them to file a case against in supreme court.

  6.1 What the case should be for?
        If X amount of money donated to the NGO/temple/church/mosque/Party is from bank accounts, with receipts, with source name's PAN card, then the NGO/temple/mosque/church can only and exactly show X amount of spending.


     6.2 If the spending about to  more than X+1 amount of money, then there should be serious probing against the NGO/mosque/temple/church/party.



I doubt the supreme court will understand this, given the kind of stupid and corrupt system they have for electing the judges.

6. 1974 - Indira Gandhi makes important amendments to constitution that will allow her more control over government and introduces words such as socialist in preamble of constitution. And also India conducts it's first nuclear test against the will of whole world.

7. 1975 - Indira Gandhi is about to loose her chair as prime minister due to unfair practice in elections. She declares political emergency and assumes control over whole India.

8. 1977 - Morarji Desai becomes prime ministers and introduces safeguards in constitution so that it isn't hackable to declare emergency like Indira Gandhi did.

9. 1987 - Rajiv Gandhi meddles in Kashmir elections and starts a chain of events which creates the situation in Kashmir we have today.

Investing in developing nuclear capabilities

Golden Quadrilateral

Economic liberalisation

Setting up of IITs/IIM and Hindu Code Bill

I didn't name the Prime Minister's because although they are important figures, they are not integral. Also something I realised is that each leader is burdened by the legacy and shadow of their predecessor while setting the stage for their successor. 

Unlike the title of Sanjay Baru's book, there are no Accidental Prime Ministers. 

 Well, being from NIT, the idea to convert REC to NIT by Vajpayee was a game changer. The 17 Regional Engineering Colleges were established in the major states of India as a cooperative venture between the central and respective state governments. In 2002, the Indian government decided to upgrade all Regional Engineering Colleges (""RECs"") to NITs and later raised a few other reputed government colleges.

This helped immensely.  Atal Bihari Vajpayee :-

*Golden Quadrilateral program 

*Divestment and Special Economic Zones

*Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna 

*Pokran-Underground Nuclear Weapon Test I would like to nominate the Indo-US nuclear deal as one of the recent  notable achievement. Manmohan Singh risked the the entire government to get that one passed. I strongly feel that we should look towards nuclear energy for our energy needs and the deal with the United State was an extremely important spring board. Swach Bharat MISSION !! CLEAN India

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

>The 508km-long Mumbai to Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) is scheduled for completion in December 2023, but commencement date has been sought to be advanced to August 2022.

>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.

>According to initial estimates, around 1.6 crore people are expected to travel by the bullet train annually. By 2050, around 1.6 lakh commuters should travel by the high-speed train on a daily basis.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

What role will Govt play, if private sector has a free run?",Indianopolice," > private sector has a free run?

it will not end happily, i assure you.  The article did not mention the role of Govt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW5FRuMkQ6g That's the classical liberal or libertarian point of view, espoused by the Chicago School of Economics. That would be minarchism, neo-liberalism isn't necessarily the Austrian school.  This isn't really a question for economists but more for political scientists, but that's just semantics. 

Neo-liberal refers to the 'original' liberalism, that is the liberalism that developed during the 17th-18th century that advocated for government to have limited power and to vest greater power in the individual. Theoretically this means the government serves as minimal a role as possible- upholding laws through courts and police forces, providing national defence, etc.

The issue is that 'law and order' as 'justice' are broad terms that aren't clearly defined. For instance, you can and people have argued that banning alcohol is a government move to uphold law and order, as less drunkards will cause trouble or beat their wives or commit assault. You can argue that reservation policies are a policy to uphold justice, to correct the injustice of generations of caste discrimination and such. 

Naturally neo-liberalism vests a lot of power and freedom in the private sector. That said, anti-trust and pro-competition regulations are another key role for the government to play.  When Jhootly and call drop mantri fails to auction spectrum to its potential and loot the exchequer. /s Govt Role - Providing basic services like public transport,good roads, water and electricity (which can be contracted to private players) and govt. schools and maybe govt. universities

Federal Govt. - National Security, Defence and Foreign Policy and helping states in facilitating economic growth and fund central universities, access to afordable healthcare (doesn't mean running govt. hospitals) and enforce contracts and regulate.

State Govt. - Law and order, ensuring the above services are delivered, fund state universities and ensure facilitation of economic growth by removing roadblocks for businesses, slash redtape, repeal redundant state laws and enforce the laws.

All other economic activity like running companies must be done by private players. That's the conservative way of thinking, not liberal.",2016-11-07 17:49:50

**ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS-JOY FOR INC, WAKE-UP CALL FOR BJP**

**Can the Congress upset the odds in 2019?**

The biggest question everybody had before today’s results was can the Congress fight back against Modi and BJP, especially with 2019 around the corner. While their performance in Telangana and Mizoram was disappointing, it will take heart from its wins in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. 

For a party which was in disarray until a year and half ago with no clear sense of direction from the party high command, the Congress has slowly staggered back onto its feet to fight the Modi and Shah duo. With a seemingly reinvigorated Rahul Gandhi at the helm, they have taken the fight to the BJP in Modi’s own bastion-Gujarat, cobbled together an alliance in Karnataka and now snatched Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh back from the BJP. 

While the party is trying hard to capitalise on the anger of the masses against the Central government’s policies and decisions, the Congress still has a lot of work to do on the ground level if it seriously wants to come back to power in 2019. While the results might show Congress winning in three states, there is a very distinct and real possibility that voters were fed up with their state BJP governments due to anti-incumbency and they are still going to vote for Modi to become the PM again in 2019.The Congress’s performance in Rajasthan is also considered to be relatively disappointing with chaotic seat distribution, infighting and rebel Congress leaders costing the party another 15 odd seats.

**What next for the BJP?**

While the results aren’t going to make BJP workers too happy, the BJP still remains in pole position to come back to power in 2019. With the so called ‘Third Front’ still nowhere near fruition and the Congress’s efforts to pitch RaGa against NaMo not exactly gathering steam with other opposition parties means that Modi continues to be the most popular political leader in India currently. The extradition of Christian Michel related to the Agusta Westland scam and the recent court order allowing the extradition of Vijay Mallya from the UK also serve as a timely boost to the BJP’s anti-corruption rhetoric, which was on a slippery slope after the Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi sagas. The BJP has also made no effort to hide its Hindutva agenda, starting with the renaming of Allahabad to Prayagraj and Faizabad to Ayodhya. BJP led state governments in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also cleared the way for the building of gigantic statues of Lord Shiva and Rama respectively and this Hindutva pitch will only get more brazen in the lead-up to 2019.

While the BJP might be smug about its chances in 2019, it has to keep an eye on the grumbling middle class and farmers-both unhappy with poll promises not being kept. The agrarian distress and lack of job creation have taken the shine off Modi’s ‘booming economy’ pitch and the BJP will be anxious to ensure it doesn’t snowball further. Furthermore, the central government’s rift with the RBI and frequent clash-ins with the Supreme Court have created the image of an overzealous central government keen to take control of all independent central agencies. 

**Will KCR lead for the formation of a Third Front?**

TRS’s emphatic victory in the state of Telangana and K Chandrashekar Rao’s victory speech might mean the resurgence in the chances for the formation of a Third Front consisting of other regional satraps including Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati. The Third Front has traditionally been a cluster of regional parties which choose to neither align with the Congress or the BJP. However, the Third Front, which has always been talked of as an alternative to India’s two-party stronghold, has never managed to give a serious fight to the Congress or the BJP in recent history. The only times the Third Front or Federal Front provided a serious threat to the Congress or BJP was in between 1996 and 1998 when it staked power at the Centre twice under H.D. Deve Gowda. Quite predictably, the government collapsed soon after due to infighting and horse-trading of MPs. 

It will be interesting to see if a Third Front comes into existence in time for 2019 and more interestingly, if they can prevent making the mistakes that they have committed in the past and become a force to reckon with.

**Controversy about EVMs**

Adding further fuel to the EVM tampering controversy, it was reported this week by multiple news sources that CCTV malfunctions occurred in the strongrooms where the EVMs were stored. Technical snags in CCTV systems installed inside the storage rooms came from Vidisha, Mandla and Bhopal. In Vidisha, it is reported that CCTV cameras went blank for 15 minutes while the one in Mandla went blank for 2 hours. Tough questions must be asked of the Election Commission as to how such a situation was allowed to develop in the first place and what it plans to do to ensure the electoral system isn’t compromised.",arseaddict," Disclaimer: I am no journalist or writer so take this with a grain of salt.

Policy/Economy,I fully supported demonetization when it happened but now it has started to feel like a scam!,111,5hp22k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5hp22k/i_fully_supported_demonetization_when_it_happened/,156,"I'm not affiliated to any polarizing ideology of the sides that are fighting a tug of war now. But here are my observations so far. These are just my opinion and experiences and may not represent the whole situation accurately

* On Nov 8^th I was pretty happy that the government did it, as I was naive to the whole economy thing I thought it was an ingenious idea to get rid of all the black money

* I was still resistant after a week when 30+ uncles started complaining (note: these were the same uncles & aunties that praised Modi up and down on 9/11 and so did I as a matter of fact )

* Even after 3 weeks i wasn't affected as i was able to withdraw 2000 and 2500 on different occasions quite easily (funny stories btw, first time i walked in to a random ATM where i saw a bunch of people doing something to the ATM machine, i just stood in front of the door and was watching what they were doing, after couple of minutes they looked at me and made a gesture to come in, and when i went the guy in Khaki(idk if he was police) told me i can draw cash now, I proceeded and gave the amount as 400, the Gurkha looked at me weirdly and said the limit was 2000, I couldn't process at the moment what he was saying and thought may be only 2000's notes were there. So i reentered the amount as 2000 and drew a stack of 20 100s! as i turned back i saw a huge ass mob outside the ATM! with people still running towards it as i was heading out of the area! )

* But then afterwards I started thinking if black money was actually eradicated? Then it dawned on me, **This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!**

* Think about it. Most of the taxes come from the working middle class people in our country. Now from this move a bunch of poor people have been included to the tax roster, let's be honest, the rich have already been avoiding taxes very intelligently and they wouldn't shell out a paisa no matter how the rules get stricter. Thanks to all the private CA guys who never  made it.

* Then modi announced about releasing records of transactions from his party members **After** 8/11. **BUT** , wouldn't they have already took measures Before 8/11... if we want to be honest here, we should check on ALL politician transactions at least five years prior to this.

* What about black money in the form of foreign currencies? To the uninformed people, Switzerland is NOT the only tax haven in the world, so who ever did have swiss accounts, would've probably switched to somewhere else. So we're not getting that money either.

* All this whole fiasco did was, bringing bunch of poor people in to Tax radar, But they earn so less, we can't actually tax them.

* But i do have a proposal though, we can efficiently use the tax money and skyrocket india's progress, but the people of india needs to involve with the policy making at the root level like people of denmark and some other baltic states do. All we have to do is to have a system where the government still collects taxes but is unable to use the money without the tax payers approval and should give them details for every paisa used.

* people should be given the power of choosing where their tax money is invested into, A nice swimming pool for a minister's residence?: Not gonna give my money.  A public toilet and a public high rise parking lot?: Shut up and take our money.

* But how would we the ^^busy people keep involved in all these process? Well, just like wester countries have Jury duties , india should have a taxer duty, where a group of people are selected from the people investing in a project and are sent to negotiate the process, these people should be non-government citizens and nobody gets to go twice from the same group or similar duration. During that period the taxers should be given paid leaves from their jobs and shouldn't be deducted from their privileged accounts.

* I'm tired now and can't type anymore, but this is my argument. **demonetization was done to bring people under tax watch, but the people we needed in tax watch evaded it any way, this whole scenario was masqueraded as a fight against corruption, which won't stop, but we can smarten up now and demand accountability for our tax money before it gets devoured by our ridiculous politicians and the bureaucracy, because, INDIA!**

peace ",DemonRyuX," > 30+ uncles. 

That's where I got more hurt than whole demonetisation.  I'm pissing off the bhakts here, but Modi is your classic megalomaniac who's been out of touch for far too long. No one with $200,000 and half a brain stores their money in cash, and the IT Dept. is retarded enough they don't know the advanced money laundering methods. 

I talked to some people in the ATM lines and they still support the guy, I've even heard phrases like *ab dekho modiji kya karte hain!*, and still believe Modiji is going to deposit 15 lakh in their accounts. 

If you've ever wondered what living in a failed state looks like, Modiji is giving you that experience. Thanks Modiji for preparing us for the post-apocalyptic world!

All I know is, Kejriwal needs to step up his shit now. Congress has the people to counter BJP but it ain't gonna happen in 20 more years since Rahul won't give up his position. The opposition is up for grabs, no one is coming forward to grab it.  दूध का जला, छांच भी फुंक फुंक के पीता है!

I have been wary of all schemes launched by this govt. From the very beginning since i never drank the modi kool-aid.

This demonitization thing is swacch bharat 2.0. Looks good on paper...but when it comes to implementation, exposes the Govt. Machinery.
 That 8th November Announcement itself was a sham.There is a petition filed in the courts that the video of Modi wasn't even Live.It was Pre-recorded as you could see the video quality and the voice which sounds different than the voice in live feeds.So one could very easily doubt that the video was made before 8th of Nov.

Hence much of the chance and opportunity was give to those big wigs to save their asses.And the Media is quiet about this petition too,only National Dastak did show that news and the person who filed that petition.There was a press conference which was done in Press Club of India.

Edit :

[Found the Link,And that petition is filed by DD News Reporter](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=54OXSRsxTiA) As I've made clear in another thread, the biggest damage done isn't the next few quarters, but the long-term damage to India's image. Why would an investor setup a textile mill in India instead of Vietnam or Bangladesh when this kind of crazy shit is happening? Who knows what else the government might cook up because its addicted to a narrative of being ""bold"". 

Investors want long-term stability and a political leadership which is data-driven and competent. Demonetisation's biggest victim is India's reputation as an investment destination. Investment as a share of GDP has been declining for many quarters already and it won't get better in the aftermath of this clownshow. 

Most of the FDI we've seen has come in the form of equity and often in already existing businessness. Greenfield FDI into manufacturing, has been far more slower to materialise, and that's the kind of FDI which India desperately needs. And it isn't just FDI. Most investment comes from domestic sources. Banks and companies are already burdened with NPAs. This could worsen that situation as sales take a hit. 

People should look to the medium and longterm and be worried about that. The short-term hit, as bad as it is, will be overshadowed by the reputational damage done. To speak nothing of the employment losses in a situation where India is already struggling to generate enough jobs to the millions upon millions of new labour force entrants every year.  It's not just the rich that evade tax there are numerous traders who do the same. I don't get a bill for most cash payments. The change already affects huge black money deals as long the cash limit remains the same. >This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!

while I agree with you but I don't see what is wrong in bringing more people under tax radar.  Sure, there are many people who are poor but you are also underestimating the number of people who are capable of paying taxes and don't. 

For example - I have estimated that my milkman earns around 45k - 50k per month and I am pretty sure he doesn't pay taxes because he demands cash. He even offered me credit when I said I didn't have cash, but refused to take the cheque or netbanking option. 

How to bring such people under tax radar? Demonetisation may not be pretty and may even not be effective we have to wait for the numbers to see whether it has made a difference or not.  couldn't agree more. Initially, i though it was a brilliant and brave decision but people are dying, literally! 
As Raghuram Rajan himself put it, ""intelligent people will find their way around demonetization"" and that is exactly what's happening. next elections are going to be interesting!  number of income tax paying citizens is not going to increase too much. the poor don't have enough money to be taxed. the salaried class have been paying taxes all along. the businessmen and the rich will continue to avoid the taxes. there would be at most a marginal increase in income taxes. > This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with

The intention was to
 
* Target hoarded black money
* Remove fake notes from the market
* Stop terrorist funding, not just in Kashmir, but Nexals, Maoists etc.
* Issue lower amount of cash in market then it was existing before, thus creating cash crunch and force people to use digital (not everyone, but those who can..will)
* Bring everyone under tax radar, not for taxing them, but to get analytics correct for the next step, which is going to be the big one.
* UP Elections ;)
* Digital economy is must for GST and to succeed and remove poverty from India.
* Digital economy is must to reduce corruption in government offices as well as to reduce crime.
* This step was to close doors for the next bigger one, i.e. the black money in assets. Once the Benami Law is going to be used on large scale to unearth huge amount of hidden wealth, there will be no way to sell properties in 60-40. Unable to sell it they will have to let it go to the government or go to prison. This law is pretty strict and will not only punish the person who buys, but as well as the person on whose name it was bought. So imagine some big shot get caught and his son or daughter also go to prison because of his mistake. People collect wealth thinking even if they go to prison, their family will be rich. Here things will be different ;)
* Its fine if someone has stored wealth outside India, but government is trying to recover that too, it is elusive because we can't dictate terms on other countries, but we can identify whenever they try to bring that money to India and then we can royally screw them.
* The people have voting power already for 70 years, all they got was poverty. 
 This is the problem with ""the 1% is evil"" mentality people.
so you think black money is generated only by the super rich,and not by anyone else?
or do you want only the super-rich to fund the entire country while ""poor"" and middle class people don't pay tax,because ""it is gonna be looted by the Govt?
this sub doesn't disappoint Funnily enough, I was thinking of making a ""I don't understand the demonetization panic"" post (but decided otherwise because I had better things to do).

On Friday night, I went and stood in an ATM line for the first time since demonetization, just for the sake of it (other than a few hundred rupees for rickshaws over the past few months, I haven't needed cash). So anyway, I stood in line for two hours and was able to draw the money. It wasn't as painful of an experience as all these fucked up need channels are touting it to be and I didn't die in the process (or have a baby delivered or suffer a heart attack or any of that crap). The only problem was the dumbasses in the line who had come up with   rules of their own, and started fighting over them but I just chose to ignore them and calmly withdrew the cash. >This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!

>Think about it. Most of the taxes come from the working middle class people in our country

Most poor won't make it into the taxable bracket. 1% pays 99% of income tax. Widening the tax net is inextricably linked to combating black money. Untaxed black money by businesses turns into bribes for politicians and bureaucrats. And bringing more people under tax watch doesn't mean taxing the poor, there is 2.5 lakh individual income tax limit upto which there are 0 taxes. Even one slab above has nominal tax rate.  I don't understand.

How is bringing people into the tax net a BAD thing? 

I mean sure, some big fish will escape with the help of their CAs and other connections, and attempts are being made to bring them to book, but then that does not mean the move as a whole is bad. Is that ""denmark-ist "" taxing system practically possible in India?Has anyone explored that line of thinking?It seems more like UBI in the west which has no possible implementation in our country in near future. I disagree what do you mean by poor people have to pay tax? there are tax slabs and if your earnings are taxable, you aren't really poor. if everyone paid taxes honestly, we the service class won't be burdened by the low tax rebates. >But then afterwards I started thinking if black money was actually eradicated? Then it dawned on me, This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!

Why is this a bad thing? If you receive or use government services - like using a road or the railways or education schemes - you should pay your fair share of taxes. 

We often complain about 'stupid Indians' spitting or peeing and such on public property - when Indians universally start realizing they're the ones paying for it through their taxes (by making them actually pay taxes) that sort of thing will start to curb. If this decision stops riots in Kashmir and make people with attitude of  हमारे सात पूशते बैठके खाऐगे  worry, Then I am in for all of this.  Why should only people like me who withdraw salary from bank pay taxes. Make each one of us pay as per their earnings, why appeasement of certain classes >But then afterwards I started thinking if black money was actually eradicated? Then it dawned on me, This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!

Typical Indian mindset here. Tax nai bharna but wants the defence, research, public services to be well funded. Only 1% of Indians pay tax as of now. Its a ridiculous figure. If demonetization gets this 1% to even 5%, i think its a big big success. I would like the see the face of Manmohan Singh if govt successfully increases our tax base.  All of you critics of modi; repent and cleanse your accounts today.

Tomorrow the wheel *will* turn and he will correctly regain the initiative. Modi is one of the best politicians we have had in the past 20 years.

And then you will regret these excesses today.

Edit: downvote me all you like, but when the so called Bhakt army finds something to refocus on, it's going to be ugly.  As an ABCD, is this really as bad as you guys are saying? Or are you guys just bias af? Bunch of overreacting retards in this sub.Its been less than 2 months since demonetization, what the fuck did you guys expect? I'm neither anti or pro demonetization, i'll wait for a few months and then decide if this is a scam or not. It's not about money, it's about sending a message. 


Even if it doesn't work atleast people know govt is strict on corruption and its not the same as previous govt. India won't change overnight, neither will Indians. It's a journey . People want corruption free India but also don't want to give up corruption at personal level.  [removed]",2016-12-11 15:39:40
Policy/Economy,Demolishing Some LCA Tejas Falsehoods,533,4r5hgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4r5hgo/demolishing_some_lca_tejas_falsehoods/,120,"_""The Tejas is an old design. It has taken 32 long years to develop! And despite being in development for so long, it isn't truly indigenous. Its heart, the engine, is of foreign origin. So are its weapons and some avionics. Furthermore, it is so deficient in its performance, that the Indian Air Force (IAF) wants Rafales/Su-30MKIs/F-16s instead.""_

Every time the Tejas achieves some important milestone, these criticisms are repeated ad nauseum, in the popular media, on Twitter, on internet forums, and at bhel-puri stalls in Jhumritalaiyya. It's infuriating to see an effort of this magnitude, one that has produced [many successes](http://www.ibnlive.com/blogs/india/saurav-jha/the-radiance-of-tejas-a-bright-prospect-for-make-in-india-10879-748651.html), being panned time and again. So I've taken the liberty to put together this handy-dandy LCA Tejas mythbusting guide to counter them.

And without wasting your time any further, I'll jump right in.

**False Argument 1: The Tejas is ""late"". It has been under development for 32 years!**

The figure is technically true, but deprives the narrative of much-needed context. The Tejas’ origins can indeed be traced back to 1983, when the concept of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) was conceived. However, the IAF did not finalise its air staff requirements (ASRs) until 1985 and initial funding did not come through until 1986. The project definition phase—the phase in which technical requirements are defined and a conceptual design prepared did not end until 1988. The final design was completed in 1990. Full funding was issued only in 1993, after which the development of a prototype commenced in earnest. See [this list of milestones](http://www.tejas.gov.in/history/milestones.html) for reference.

Following several years of delay in the development process—delays that can at least partly be traced back to overly optimistic R&D timeline projections, scope creep, and [US sanctions on India](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-05-31/news/39655783_1_drdo-chief-v-k-saraswat-lca-project) following the 1998 nuclear tests—the Tejas had its first flight in 2001. From then, the project proceeded at a pace that is not too different that of comparable fighter aircraft development programmes worldwide. It is slated to achieve final operational clearance (FOC), the stage at which an aircraft is considered fully ready for squadron service, in early 2017; fifteen years from the date of the first flight. At this time, the it is expected to be ready to carry out multiple functions: beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air combat, short-range dogfighting, and precision ground attack with a variety of guided and unguided weaponry.

That compares well with contemporary fourth-generation fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JAS-39 Gripen. The first technology demonstrator of what would later be called the Typhoon first flew [in 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Eurofighter_Typhoon). The definitive version with an AESA radar is [still not in service today](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/euroradar-nears-flight-test-phase-for-captor-e-on-ty-416564/), 30 years down the line. The Tranche-2 version, which can drop precision bombs and fire BVR missiles, wasn't available [until 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm). Another European fighter, the Swedish Gripen-C, with full-spectrum capabilities, started entering service in 2002, also fourteen years after its first flight. 

The Tejas is about to FOC with all of these capabilities in late 2016. The fact that ADA managed to achieve similar or better timelines with the Tejas after its first flight, that too without the benefit of half a century of experience in building advanced fighters or the industrial ecosystem that enables such high-technology to proceed swiftly, is an achievement that is not given enough credit.

**False Argument 2: Because of the inordinate delays in development, the Tejas is now deficient.**

Just because the development was delayed doesn't mean that the design is the same one from 1983. The IAF updated its requirements quite often and kept demanding additional capabilities throughout the design and development phase. It was a Catch-22 situation: the constant change in requirements kept the design up-to-date, but it also led to several years of delays because of the need to re-design, re-test, and re-certify subsystems after every modification. Off the top of my head, I can remember that the IAF demanded the following modifications pretty late into the program:

* Open avionics architecture.
* Precision bombing capabilities.
* Heavier A2A missiles (R-73 vs R-60).
* Internal EW suite that included a self-protection jammer.
* Inflight refueling
* More capable radar and missiles (LCA Mk-1A)

With these modifications, the Tejas went from being a simple point-defence interceptor to a full-blown (albeit short-legged) multi-role fighter. 

**False Argument 3: The LCA falls short on several performance parameters like empty weight, range, turn rates, etc. The IAF has allowed 53 concessions/permanent waivers in the design.**

Like the 32-year delay, this too is a scary looking quote that paints a false picture of how fighter aircraft programmes work.

First off, it is important to remember that the Tejas can carry out most of the tasks intended of it quite competently. It can fight other aircraft at beyond visual range (when equipped with an AESA radar and Derby/Derby-ER missiles, it could end up becoming _the most capable_ BVR platform in IAF service). The addition of an Israeli helmet-mounted sight coupled to missiles whose seekers have a wide field of view (R-73 and Python IV/V) make it a fearsome dogfighter and compensate for minuscule shortfalls in aerodynamic performance. It can drop laser-guided bombs on ground targets with great precision. It is also very easy to fly. [In the words of the IAF](http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/air-force-drdo-pleased-with-tejas-performance-at-bahrain-116022200321_1.html), the fighter’s ""control harmony is comparable to the best in the world… The intuitive cockpit layout and highly reliable life support systems provide for comfort as well as excellent situational awareness."" There are many such triumphs; too many, in fact, to recount here.

Secondly, _every_ fighter project concludes with specifications that aren't met, or a few deficiencies in performance. It’s never that big of a roadblock to induction in service. And all said and done, 53 is a very small number as far as design concessions go; a pretty small portion of the entire range of capabilities. Even simpler aircraft (like the [C-17]( http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910528&slug=1285732)) enter service with more deficiencies. These are either compensated with using improvements in other areas to offset performance shortfalls, or accepted in the interest of availability for combat. 

Again, I shall go back to the Eurofighter Typhoon to illustrate my point. Remember I mentioned that it first flew in 1986? Twenty-two years later, it [couldn't independently drop a laser-guided bomb](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/01/eurofighter_austere_air_to_ground_what_joy/) on a target with any precision. Basic BVR combat capability was not available until Tranche 2 models were procured [in 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm), 14 years after the first flight. Even in close air combat, its capabilities were decidedly limited. The helmet mounted sight (HMS)—a system that allows the pilot to cue weapons onto an enemy aircraft by simply turning his head and offers a quantum jump in dogfighting capabilities—did not enter service [until 2010](https://www.eurofighter.com/about-us).

The F-35 was hobbled by similar issues (and terrible program management) [for several years](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/joint-strike-fighter-lockheed-martin). It didn't begin to turn a corner until 2012 or so, after which it began rapidly demonstrating some of the capabilities that were expected of it.

The companies running these projects were aero giants with decades of experience behind them. How then does one expect the ADA, which has never developed a fighter in its entire existence, to deliver a more capable product while experiencing fewer failures? 

Thirdly, the IAF itself works with deficient designs all the time. The Gnat and Su-7, both hobbled by short ranges and limited payloads, were procured in large numbers. The MiG-21, when initially inducted, was underwhelming. Its range was limited and its missiles didn't work. The Bison is still riddled with issues. The Jaguar had a deficient nav-attack suite. It was practically useless in the long range strike role until the IAF and HAL developed and implemented the [DARIN upgrades](https://tkstales.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/the-darin-story/). The MiG-27's navigation system [never performed satisfactorily](http://www.livefistdefence.com/2010/07/special-report-story-of-indias-mig-27.html), and its reliability was terrible. But none of this troubled the IAF. Why then is the LCA failing to achieve a handful design parameters something to raise a huge hue and cry about?


**False Argument 4(a): The LCA isn't really indigenous. Many of its subsystems are of foreign origin.**

But many more of its critical subsystems are of Indian origin too! The first one that comes to mind is the carbon-fibre composite airframe. It is a very high-end product that reduces weight (thus permitting the carriage of a substantial external payload), aids maintenance, brings down manufacturing time, and so on. The fact that some of the technology involved in its manufacture has been exported to Airbus is a testament to its success.

Another example is the digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system, developed from scratch by ADA scientists in India after their work, notes, and equipment was impounded by Lockheed Martin in 1998. No country on earth, not one, has developed such a complex system and gotten it to work perfectly on the first try. It works so well that when it was first tested on an F-16XL in the US (this was before the nuclear tests), it improved the test-bed's handling qualities in several flight regimes. There is a reason the Tejas' test pilots call the aircraft to fly.

There are many other examples. The avionics. The mission computers. The navigation equipment, displays, and human-machine interface. The EW systems. This stuff isn't trivial by any yardstick.

Now coming to the foreign components aboard the aircraft. With the exception of the Americans, and to an extent the Russians, _every_ country has used foreign subsystems extensively in its aircraft designs. The [Gripen](http://www.airframer.com/aircraft_detail.html?model=JAS_39_Gripen) has an American engine, a British airframe design, Swiss carbon-fibre, an Italian radar, an American flight control system, a cockpit with critical components purchased from Britain, and so on. This in spite of the Swedes having an industrial base that is far more advanced than India's and extensive experience developing cold-war fighters such as the Draken and Gripen. The Rafale and Typhoon both use American ejection seats. Their flight control system uses actuators from Moog, an American company. The Russians were buying [Damocles pods](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/russian-fighters-to-use-thales-damocles-targeting-pods-220747/) for the Su-35s before the French stopped military exports after they invaded Crimea. Nearly every Chinese fighter in service today uses a Russian engine, a Russian ejection seat, and a slew of Russian weaponry. If these aircraft all qualify as ""indigenous"", then surely the Tejas does too?

The choice that Indian design agencies faced was quite stark: should they have tried to build every little component in-house, thus reinventing the wheel at every step? Or used technologies/sub-systems available easily in the market in the initial stages and then made an attempt to indigenise over the life-cycle of the product? It's obvious that the latter was the more sensible path to take.

In the final analysis, the Tejas is an aircraft that has been designed by Indians in India, and is tailored to Indian requirements. If that doesn't make it indigenous, I don't know what does.
	

**False Argument 4(b): Okay, I get that. But the aircraft's very heart, its engine, is fully imported! Surely it's an utter failure on that front?**

Yes and no. It has had a very protracted development cycle, and for good reason. A jet engine is arguably represents the pinnacle of modern technology, making it the most challenging system in the world to develop from scratch. It has to produce ungodly amounts of power for its size and operate at the very edge of what physics allows. The GE F404—which ended up replacing the Kaveri on the LCA—weighs just a shade over 1000 kg and develops close to 80 kN of wet thrust. Assuming that it propels the LCA to Mach 0.9 at sea level (1,100 km/h), it's developing about 24,400 kW or 32,700 hp. That's 32 hp per kg. In contrast, a Formula-1 car engine generates ""only"" 8 or 9 hp per kg, and it's about as far as one can get with piston engines.

What does it take to generate so much power? One needs critical components like turbine blade assemblies that see inlet temperatures of 1,400°C or so while being subject to extreme forces. A back-of-the envelope calculation using rectally extracted figures tells me that a single high pressure turbine blade weighing 50 gm, and rotating at 16,000 RPM at the end of a 500 mm diameter disk, will be subject to a centrifugal force of about 3,500 kgf. Imagine two Honda Civics hanging off a tiny blade that is about as large as two of your fingers held together. There is a transverse load component as well; the 80 kN of thrust is distributed over the turbine blades. 

In order to sustain such loads, exotic materials and precision manufacturing techniques are required. Steel melts at about 1400°C, and starts rapidly losing strength at less than 500°C, so it's obviously not an option. Modern engines instead use nickel-based superalloys. Moreover, the material can't simply be cast or forged or machined into shape. The blade has to be produced via directional solidification or grown out of a single crystal in what looks more like a lab than a production shop. The shape, too, is very intricate. There are internal channels that route cold air taken from the compressor to the surface of the blade to keep it cool.

The fan, compressor, combustor, gearbox assemblies, bearings ... they're just as complex. And they all have to be precision manufactured to ensure that microscopic imbalances don't end up leading to excessive vibrations that could end up destroying the engine and the aircraft while in flight. Then there are requirements like safety, fuel efficiency, minimum total technical life, and reliability that add multiple layers of complexity to the design.

Now imagine the magnitude of effort required to develop something like this, with practically zero infrastructure and very little in terms of  a pre-existing knowledge base. And with skinflint bureaucrats refusing to approve requests for funding, test equipment, or manufacturing tools without documentation being submitted in triplicate and subject to audit after audit.

Now let us talk costs. The GTRE spent [Rs. 2,000 crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rs-2101-crore-spent-on-development-of-indigenous-kaveri-engine-heres-why-theres-been-a-delay/articleshow/48282481.cms), or approximately $640 million in equivalent US dollars (with all the exchange rate and inflation variations that happened between 1989 and now taken into account), on developing the Kaveri. This seems like a lot, until you see that advanced nations spend billions on such programmes, and they almost never develop clean-sheet designs. They are always building on existing knowledge and existing designs. 

[Jeff Immelt, the CEO of GE says](http://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-on-transforming-ge-2015-12), ""If you could make something with 60 people in a garage, GE shouldn't be doing it. But if you make a jet engine, there's only like one and a half people in the world that can make a jet engine. And we are really good at that. If you want to compete with that, you've got to put yourself on a wayback machine and go back 25 years and invest $1 billion here for 25 years and then _maybe, just maybe_ [emphasis mine], you're going to be able to compete with us.""

Think about that for a second. It requires 25 years. And a billion dollars. And then too, you're more likely to fail than succeed.

The Chinese have been pouring money and espionage resources into their jet engine development efforts (they have budgeted [300 billion yuan](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030)—about 45 billion in today's US dollars—over the next 20 years on engine programs alone), and are still facing [significant hurdles](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030). Why do people feel that India would get significant results by spending just a few thousand crores?

In any case, the Kaveri isn't a complete write off. A naval derivative, the [Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/built-for-air-force-kaveri-engine-chosen-by-navy-109090800089_1.html) may end up powering Indian Navy vessels. It is also under consideration to [power an Indian UAV](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/now-kaveri-engine-to-power-indigenous-uav-115073001650_1.html). 

There are civilian spin-offs too. For example, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) [now uses](http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/DRDO_BROCHURE_2015.pdf) the investment casting technology developed by GTRE for manufacturing blades for gas turbines used in power generation.

**False Argument 5: In a globalised world, there is no point re-inventing the wheel. The IAF should simply dump it and buy the Gripen/F-16/MiG-35**

What is true for cell phones or cars isn’t true for military equipment. In the long run, in peace and in war, the IAF would be best served by fielding fighters designed and built in India. That's the only way it will equip itself with a large fleet on a (relatively) small budget. There are other advantages to developing the technology in-house: less dependence on foreign suppliers, leading to increased strategic independence. Creation of a stronger local economy and industrial ecosystem. The freedom to tinker with the design and optimise it to suit local requirements without running afoul of IP agreements with the OEM. Spin-offs in the civilian world. And so on and so forth. And if going indigenous is indeed the way forward, then the IAF will have to live with fielding under-performing/problematic designs at the beginning. It will have to make peace with the fact that aerospace R&D is a slow, painful process that is fraught with risk.

That's how practically everyone else did it. The Chinese did not seek out the latest and greatest toy because their initial designs (Q-5, JH-7, J-8, J-10) failed to match up to what the US, Japan, and India fielded. If the J-10B and J-20 are flying today, it is only because the PLAAF and PLAN flew inferior aircraft for decades while their industrial capabilities matured. As it is, the Tejas program's achievements have been quite impressive: the country has developed a fourth-generation fighter that is as good as the Gripen-C from scratch. It uses more home-grown technology than the Gripen does; including such critical subsystems like the digital FBW, the composite airframe, a large portion of the avionics, etc. Many of these have been applied to the IAF's legacy aircraft as upgrade packages. To throw it all away because of a handful of challenges here and there or because Lockheed or Boeing are offering to transfer their manufacturing lines to India would be incredibly, utterly stupid. If the Tejas is cancelled, we will have a repeat of the same thirty-year saga the next time India tries to build her own fighter.
",Bernard_Woolley," Well researched and well written. Every post of yours is gold. Please don't ever leave this forum. [deleted] Im not Indian, but the Tejas is something every Indian should be proud about. Truly going to be a world beater in the arena of Multi Role Combat aircraft. 

Its unit cost is going to be its greatest asset, especially if it attracts a market outside of India.  Very well written. Got a headache after reading all the comments just rabidly criticising LCA Tejas. I hope this gets some visibility and people stop spouting nonsense. Nicely done, you might want to add that, because of these similar arguments, Indira Gandhi dropped the Marut and went for the Jaguar. IF we had managed these severe teething issues in the 60's, we could have had advanced capabilities in this field. [deleted] [deleted] Just want to say that if India can develope cryogenic engine then we can indeed develope jet engines for our planes. I think India has just not sit together to see how various government organisations can benefit from each other.

 Many of the companies like GE , Lockheed Martin, Grumann, Raytheon are older then India itself ! Means to say they existed much before the independence of India. So ya they have years and years of experience and these companies got hugely benefitted from Cold war during which time USA government was spending huge amount of their GDP only for defence and space program.

Indian news channels are complete shit and such reporting are expected from them nothing abnormal here but what surprises me is IAF enthusiasm for Tejas. I think IAF is overlooking their long term benefit in not supporting Tejas whole heartedly. 

All in all Americans suffer from ""not invented here"" and we suffer from "" invented here"" syndrome.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  OP given your extensive knowledge you should declare your biases. I mean do you work in the Tejas project or are you an independent researcher. 

Second, can you please compare Tejas to other similar fighter jets globally, specially to Chinese jets and Pakistan's F16s ? How does it compare on performance and capability parameters.

I'm excited about the Tejas. An indigenous fighter jet will help us bring down costs and it can serve as an airforce workhorse for many years to come.  Very well written.
It will be interesting to note if buzzfeed and scoopwhoop pick this side of story...this needs more visibility outside reddit  Will Tejas trump anything that Pakistan or China currently have in their arsenal? Thank you for this very nice write up. Would it be too much to ask for sources / references (wherever possible) to the points listed here? [deleted] [deleted] hey /u/Bernard_Woolley  could you recommend any documentaries about jet engines, Thanks  > at bhel-puri stalls in Jhumritalaiyya

How dare you question the Aeronautical Engineering skills of the omniscient Bhaiyyaji?


/s a lot of the points are valid, but id like to point out that every aircraft(gripen,eurofighter,rafale,chinese fighters, russian,american) has had a radar and a significant amount of its other avionics developed indigenously.

secondly  the tejas in being inducted in a time where 5th gen fighters are starting to be inducted. and its not as maneuverable as the other delta wing fighters that are in service/production, nor does it carry the payload compared to them or  have the flight ceiling.

nevertheless it is a decent fighter, that fills its role in replacing the mig-21, hopefully HAL can bring up its annual production numbers up, the numbers build is a big indicator of the success of an aircraft it has yet to supply enough production fighters to make up a squadron, let alone export. This is an eye opener...phew... Great post mate. One thing though, the figure you mentioned for the development of the Indian Kaveri engine (~2000C INR), I got your point but you cannot make a super direct comparison to the development cycle cost of a product in both countries. There are lots of important economic differences between a country life India and say United States (cheap labor, lower auxiliary costs). 

But, I agree with the fact that the entire project was quite underfunded and got stuck up in the bureaucratic red tape.  saved, befriended and following...thanks for insightful posts > A back-of-the envelope calculation using rectally extracted figures  

He he. I am steeling that. give this man/women a gold Ripping post Very well written post. Thanks OP.

But aren't the points here kinda true?. The tejas is delayed, you have explained why it was and the situation around it. So we can't say that these points are myths, there's some truth in it. /u/Bernard_Woolley I am not rich enough to give you gold, But have a Bow friend. Thanks for writing this. 

Any of the folk who do not want to read this long. Remember this important point OP made.
>If the Tejas is cancelled, we will have a repeat of the same thirty-year saga the next time India tries to build her own fighter. Excellent post. Like another commenter mentioned .. well researched as well.
It would be nice if you can also spend some time elaborating the differences between fighters in the arsenels of airforces around the world.

What do you think about a hypothetical war scenario with China and how the tejas might play a role in that? Dear Sir,

You have made some very good observations about the LCA. Thanks so much for sharing.

In addition to what you have said I will just make a small addition.

How good an aircraft the LCA is , will depend on the situation and type of mission (SEAD, DEAD) that it is entrusted with .If the enemy IADS is dense and overlapping every single  fighter aircraft & not just the LCA will have a hard time in penetrating it. For example, even stealth fighter like the F 22, F 35, J 31 will find it difficult to enter the airspace over Moscow. Ergo, how good or bad the LCA is will depend what the adversary has in store in terms of SAMs , Anti Aircraft Artillery and of course fighter aircraft.

Thanks & Regards,
D Nicely written! what they need to do is put in a precision 5.56 mm automatic rifle on a little propeller driven drone that can shoot down infiltrators across LoC. nothing fancy - just some good IR cameras, the ability to fly for 6 hours non stop and one 5.56 mm gun. no need for bombs and missiles. just a rifle that can shoot down infiltrators and can be used during encounters. Lol unexpected Jhumritalaiyya reference. Excellent write-up. I only wish you had written this sooner.

A small nitpick though.

>This in spite of the Swedes having an industrial base that is far more advanced than India's and extensive experience in the form of the Draken and ~~Gripen~~ Viggen.

Edit : Could you do a weekly/fortnightly summary of Indian security matters like /u/dextermilburn does abt the Indian economy? It would go a long way in avoiding pointless debates all over the place. Thank you for the wonderful information. On the other end automobiles like Mahindra and Tata have to spend serious amount of money in developing home grown engine development. The day is not far we produce our first indigenous car engine made completely R&D.  What is the validity of the WhatsApp forwards that claim that Tejas is a milestone for Make In India, and that Modi fast tracked its development after the Congress had tried to stifle it to benefit foreign companies? Hence you see Tejas finally ready after all these years because the PM really pushed for it.

Sounds like propaganda but you never know. I will let actual IAF pilots judge. So far, most of the initial vibes from their side and also from ACM Raha have mostly been positive. If it beats the MiG-21 and MiG-27 in safety and survivability, that is good enough for me, for now. 

Buying as expensive a jet as Saab Gripen makes little sense, especially since we know little how a Swedish jet will perform in 'Indian conditions' (read: higher dust particulate matter, higher bird density, lesser margin of error while landing). But how about replacing our long-junked MiG-25 reconnaissance fleet with the MiG-31 ? After the three MiG-25 elite recon squadrons were entirely retired and decomissioned in 2007-08 how have we filled that gap ? [deleted] Speaking of falsehoods, your entire article is full of them and in reality mostly bakwas. That the redditors here actually upvoted you and even bothered to gold you simply exposes the complete universal ignorance of readers here regarding aerospace development and its history. Responding in depth is somewhat difficult in a tiny reply box so forgive any formatting errors I make. I will quote your text in **bold** and my reply normally.

**The figure is technically true, but deprives the narrative of much-needed context. The Tejas’ origins can indeed be traced back to 1983, when the concept of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) was conceived. However, the IAF did not finalise its air staff requirements (ASRs) until 1985 (and kept on requesting major changes throughout the design and development phase, but more on that later) and initial funding did not come through until 1986. The project definition phase—the phase in which technical requirements are defined and a conceptual design prepared did not end until 1988. The final design was completed in 1990. Full funding was issued only in 1993, after which the development of a prototype commenced in earnest**

The timeline is correct in the technical sense but misleads the reader into believing that the given timeline was the planned timeline. It was not. What it is, is a post facto reciting of actual milestones blatantly ignoring all of the earlier missed deadlines. The [original](http://s12.postimg.org/noceeybi5/LCAtejas.jpg) plan was to actually have the Tejas operation by 1994. This obviously didn't happen. 

**That compares well with contemporary fourth-generation fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JAS-39 Gripen. The Typhoon first flew in 1986. The definitive version with an AESA radar is still not in service today, 30 years down the line. The Tranche-2 version, which can drop precision bombs and fire BVR missiles, wasn't available until 2008. Another European fighter, the Swedish Gripen-C, with full-spectrum capabilities, started entering service in 2002, also fourteen years after its first flight.**

Again this is completely dishonest and ignores a multitude of other factors. Primarily by comparing the progress of the LCA to the Typhoon, you are comparing one mismanaged and delayed project with another massively mismanaged and delayed project and claiming, hey its not that bad. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a poster child of delays due to a confluence of three political factors. A development cycle that spanned the end of the cold war resulting in changing political priorities by development partners. Chief among them Germany which felt that it was strategically unneccessary and cost prohibitive in the face of German reunification. Four major national partners which contributes to bureaucratic delay. Defense spending cuts for the last two decades in Europe which have led to buck passing as no one is willing to foot the bill for continued work on the project and can easily throw responsibility towards a partner nation who passes the blame and costs onto another ad infinitum.

The Gripen had it's first flight in 1988, but it actually entered service in 1993 with the Swedish Air Force with first batch deliveries completed by 1996. Comparing the Gripen C to it's original flight timeline to claim it was delayed is ludicrous because the capabilities offered by the Gripen C simply did not exist anywhere during it's development cycle. For example, the AMRAAM was not delivered to foreign customers until 1995. On the other hand, these capabilities did exist for the Tejas which had it's first flight in 2001.

Furthermore, by focusing on the delays of the Typhoon, you ignore every other fighter development project of the last two decades which shows the Tejas in a completly different light.

F/A-18E Super Hornet. First flight - 1995. Service entry - 1999
F-22. First flight - 1997. Service entry - 2005
TA-50. First flight - 2002. Service entry - 2005 (2011 for the armed variant sharing the same radar as the Tejas)
FCK-1. First flight - 1989. Service entry - 1994
JF-17. First flight - 2003. Service entry - 2007
J-10. First flight - 1998. Service entry - 2003


**Just because the development was delayed doesn't mean that the design is the same one from 1983. The IAF updated its requirements quite often and kept demanding additional capabilities of the design. It was a Catch-22 situation: the constant change in requirements kept the design up-to-date, but it also led to several years of delays because of the need to re-design, re-test, and re-certify the aircraft after every minor change. Off the top of my head, I can remember that the IAF demanded the following modifications pretty late into the program:
•Open avionics architecture.
•Precision bombing capabilities.
•Heavier A2A missiles (R-73 vs R-60).
•Internal EW suite that included a self-protection jammer.
•Inflight refueling
•More capable radar and missiles (LCA Mk-1A)

With these modifications, the Tejas went from being a simple point-defence interceptor to a full-blown (albeit short-legged) multi-role fighter. **

Whether or not the Tejas can be currently classified as obsolete depends on what the landmark you are using for comparison is. If it is the Gripen C that entered service 14 years ago, then no the Tejas is not obsolete. If it is against aircraft that are entering service now or within the next 2 years such as the F-35, T-50, and J-20, then yes it is. I bet it is also the most fuel efficient fighter jet in the world.

Policy/Economy,"Understanding the Petro Dollar, its possible decline, Fiat Currencies and how it all affects India and Why maybe it's time to look elsewhere to hold foreign reserves.",57,6z7u08,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6z7u08/understanding_the_petro_dollar_its_possible/,45,"The whole thing came up recently during some discussions I had about why people use the dollar for international trade and what would happen if the major economies of the world just stopped using the Dollar. What is the Impact of BRICS. Why US has so many wars in the middle east and they are supposedly for oil but they never really take over any oil. How US is so rich to have 800 military bases around the world with a defence budget larger than the rest of the world combined. About why countries still hold US dollar reserves when US is in trillions of dollars of debt and being in so much debt, how is US economy still afloat? So I thought of putting it together here for myself and anyone else who may want to learn about this. Now, this is what I have gleaned from my reading on the matter. I am no economist so if anyone wants to correct me on anything, I would be welcome to accept the criticism with reference material substantiating your point.

 in 1944, all the countries entered into the Bretton Woods Agreement which basically said that all of the world’s currrecies would be backed by the US Dollar and the US dollar would be backed by gold and any country could convert their currency into US dollars and then redeem US gold in exchange for that at the rate of 35 dollars per ounce of gold. Since US had the largest gold reserves at the time (75% of the entire world's gold), everyone agreed. This also allowed US treasury to fix exchange rates of dollar into different currencies and set the interest rates for interbanking transactions etc. However, the multiple wars of the US during the ’60s caused domestic inflation in the US and the value of Dollar to fall. This caused panic in all the countries and they started redeeming gold from US treasury. The US gold fell from 20,000 tonnes to 8100 tonnes very quickly. Thus, in 1971, Nixon closed the gold window i.e. he suspended the ability of any nation to redeem US gold against dollars and took the gold backing off of the US Dollar. While that allowed US to retain its gold reserves, it made the need of the US dollar among other countries non existent. So everyone started to move away from the Dollar. After that, US economy started to spiral and the price of gold became 135 dollars per ounce. On top of that, the Arab world hiked the oil prices. Now, the US desperately needed to stabilize the spiral. So they brokered a deal with the Saudis that the oil producers would not only trade oil in nothing but US Dollars and convince the OPEC (the middle eastern, north African and other oil producing countries) to do the same but also invest their (OPEC’s) oil profits in US treasury by buying US Treasury bonds. This basically means that they (OPEC) are buying out US debt. Not only this, US is printing Dollars against the amount of Foreign investments in the US treasury which is made by Oil producing nations which are their oil profits. So basically, profits from every barrel sold by OPEC make way to the US treasury and become the value against which dollars is printed. Ultimately, more the profits in oil, stronger the dollar and lesser the profits in oil, weaker the dollar. Thus US gets a double benefit out of every barrel of oil in a way. In exchange the US would sell them (Saudis) advance weapons and all the gold they demanded. (So basically weapons and gold sale in exchange for trading oil in dollars props up US dollar. Gold is still propping up US dollar indirectly by forcing the oil producers to trade in dollars). Thus the petrodollar was born. This caused the world to need US dollar again. If you wanted to buy oil, you needed US dollar by either converting your currency or by selling stuff to the US. The latter is more preferred as it is cheaper than exchanging your currency and also grows your economy. So once again, US became the benchmark of international trade since no country can hope to grow its economy without using energy aka oil and you can’t have oil without US dollars. As long as all these countries need oil, US can just print Dollars out of thin air and balance it against oil barrels (as explained above) without actually even owning a single drop of oil. (Other countries need to own the gold that they balance their currency against). US does not need to control oil, they just need to control the currency it is traded in to keep their economy afloat. (more on that later in US foreign policy). Similarly, US bokered a deal with the Latin American countries to not only trade in the US Dollar but also to give precedence to US, EU and Japanese products in trade. So if more and more countries decide to shun the dollar and trade in other currencies, this would eventually cause OPEC to switch as well and Dollar could collapse.

How? Well, US is basically just printing enormous amounts of money out of thin air. This money is being used domestically and to a much larger extent, globally. If international oil trade in dollar stops, people stop needing the dollar and use their own currency. So all the internationally circulating dollars would come back to US. Now that is just too many dollars against very little amount in the treasury and that would cause hyperinflation and economic spiral. However, the logical next step would be to just destroy the excess dollars coming in from abroad and that would keep the country’s economy afloat. While that is okay but remember, what is the dollar being printed against? The foreign investments in the treasury which are the profits from the oil trade in dollars. That would go away as well essentially leaving nothing in the treasury against which the dollar is valued. Hence dollar will literally not be worth the money it is printed on.

Second, since US currency is basically a petrodollar, its power depends on the control of oil. So right now, whoever controls middle east has major power. Today, Saudi Arabia controls Middle East and US controls Saudi Arabia. US-Saudi brotherhood sort of makes it impossible for other countries to have an influence over this. Russia has tried for decades to establish a strong foothold in the middle east but has been unsuccessful. It has also dictated the US foreign policy far the last 5 decades. Like I said, US needs to control not the oil reserves but the currency oil is traded in. Hence all the wars we hear that were for oil, were not actually for oil per se but intimidation tactics against countries that announced that they would no longer accept dollar as a currency in international oil trade. Egs When the Ayatollah of Iran announced their intention to denounce dollars in oil trade and use their own currency instead, US backed Iraq to go to war with Iran and even provided the Weapons of mass destruction to use on Iran that they later used as an excuse to invade Iraq and prosecuted Saddam Hussein for. When Iraq invaded Kuwait ( a major producer of oil) to be able to pay their loans to Kuwait and then later asked for Euro to be used for oil trade rather than Petrodollar, US invaded Iraq. When Gaddafi asked gold based Dinar instead of US dollars for oil trade, US invaded Libya. When Chavez did the same, Us staged a coup in Venezuela. However, starting a non-petro currency would break this link and oil and Middle east would become less relevant for Economic power and only be of interest for energy concerns. It is still important but less so than a economic and geopolitical chessboard of US that it is today. It may actually be a solution to achieving peace in the middle east.

However, another thing that happens is Middle East controls prices of oil which is tied to the Dollar. Recently, the Middle East (OPEC or basically Saudi Arabia) has decided to drop the international prices for their own economic reasons. Now, the countries that have oil production as a major source of revenue and trade in dollars eg many N African countries, Venezuela have seen their economy completely stabilise and destroyed. These countries are sick of US and Saudi controlling the markets in a way that affects other countries adversely. Hence, for these countries, switching to the international trading system of a gold based currency will cause their economies to stabilise.

The international reserves of EU etc, on the other hand have seen increased holdings by the OPEC countries and have been worried of increasing power of these countries in the international banking system. They would be only to glad to get rid of these holdings.

Now, non Dollar currency would cause a fall in the US dollar value. In lieu of that, here is another thing that needs to be considered. A lot of the developing countries have international trade deficits. Now these trade deficits can be in the currency of the country to whom the debt is owed or any other internationally accepted currency eg. the Dollar. If the debt is in dollars, the conversions and interest rates of borrowing are determined according to the rules of the US treasury. Again, the rates in the US treasury are linked to the value of dollar. Most countries giving out loans prefer to do so in dollars as historically the Dollar is strong and trusted not to collapse and hence the money they owe is safe. The countries taking loans also convert their debts to dollars as it is easier and the country to whom the debt is owed cannot just up and change the value of the debt owed by manipulating their currency as dollar has determined the conversion into other currencies at fixed rates, so it is safe for everyone. However, there is a slight problem with this. If you owe a debt of 1 dollar to someone, when you pay the debt, it will depend on the value of dollar to your currency at that particular instant. So if dollar has gotten stronger wrt to your currency, you shall have to pay more money and if the dollar has gotten weaker, you will owe less money in your currency. Hence the fall of the dollar would be beneficial for the countries who owe debt in dollars and bad for the countries who have loaned out debt in dollars.

Also, taking debt in dollars becomes cheaper if the value of dollar falls since the US treasury interest rates are directly tied to dollars, hence it becomes cheaper to borrow in dollars. Also, as I said, if it grows weaker still, yo will owe less money.

One more thing to consider regarding fall of the Dollar is this. Uptil now, the oil producers have been buying US treasury bonds due to the Bretton Woods deal. Other countries and US and other corporations do so too. Now, the US treasury gives a fixed rate of interest to those investing in the treasury. This rate, in turn is linked to the value of the dollar. Stronger the dollar, more the interest on US Treasury bonds and more the foreign countries invest in it. Now this means that these foreign countries would much rather invest their money in US Treasury at an assured fixed rate of interest than invest it in 3rd world countries and take a risk of maybe losing it. However, if the value of dollar were to fall, the countries would much rather draw out of the US treasury and invest more in the startups in different countries, domestically etc.

The other side of the same coin would be the countries dependent on US investment. Should the value of the dollar fall, the investment being received from the US would be of a lesser value.

On the other hand, there is one more thinh. Like I said, investments in dollars are governed by the US treasury rules. Now, basically, US banks have cut the taxes on money transfer and conversion, artificially keeping them very low to fuel the domestic and world trade etc . If the dollar were to collapse, people wouldn’t trade in dollars. They would trade in other currencies. The inetrbanking across the world would be then governed by the rules of the currency you trade in, for eg, BRICS nations will follow the tariffs etc of the Shanghai Bank where most of the reserves are held. So that effect would then depend on the rules of the bank you deal with and that can be detrimental or beneficial depending on the bank’s policies compared to the dollar.

Also, countries having holdings in the US treasury would lose the entire value of their foreign reserves. On the other hand coountries like BRICS who have their reserves in other international banks would retain the value of their foreign reserves in those banks.

What does this mean?

Indian Currency would also fall with the fall of the dollar in its current state. Now, we usually run around with the perception that Indian currency is backed by gold, That’s not true. The truth is 99% of today’s currencies US Dollar, Euro, Indian rupee, all of them are fiat currencies i.e. their value is not determined by the gold they hold but by the economic strength of the government. Only an average of 4–7% of any country’s currency is today, backed by gold. US Dollar - 4.5%, Indian rupee - 5%. The rest is held in the terms of foreign reserves in other countries like in the form of US Dollar (around 70%) in US treasury bonds, in world bank or IMF, in other currencies (around 25%) in BRICS and other foreign reserves etc. Currently if you have rs 1000 , only rs 50 is gold, around 670 is held in the form of US dollars and Rs 280 in other currencies. You might ask why is that? Well, remember the Bretton Woods agreement. At that time US had 75% of the world’s gold which backed dollar and dollar backed other currencies so most of the currency of any country was backed directly or indirectly through dollar by gold. Now, it is difficult to keep gold in your country so it was convenient for other countries to just hold foreign reserves in dollars especially with the fixed exchange rates they provided. Hence more and more portion of their currency was being held in dollars. However, after Nixon shock of 1971, dollar removed its gold backing. So, automatically all other currencies that were backed by dollar (99% of the world currencies) also became fiat currencies as a result. However, the dollar was still good and trusted so no one thought much of it, especially since dollars were being printed out of thin air. However, now with the prospect of the trust in dollar fading, this as started to worry some experts. Because of the senseless printing of dollars and in exchange all the fiat currencies, the total amount of currency can nowhere near be compensated by the gold reserves even if all the gold in the world was put together. It would form not more than 10% of the currency in the world. Now, putting this disturbing detail aside, if Dollar were to collapse, 670 rupees of your 1000 would become worthless, too. So, it isn’t wise to hold US dollars, is it? No its, not and many countries have woken up to that fact.

China has been secretly amassing large amounts of gold. OPEC countries have started removing their capital from US treasury. See, these oil producers have been receiving US gold in exchange for trading oil in US dollars and have accumulated holdings in other countries’ treasuries. Now with all the crazy gold they have received they have bought material assets like real estate etc even in other countries. Now, they can simply sell out their US treasury bonds and buy more assets such as gold and real estate from it, which they have been doing in the recent years. Now, this will start depleting the treasury and cause the fall in the value of the dollar in turn causing other countries to withdraw and invest elsewhere. That, coupled with Russia and China doing trade in Roubles and Yuan, India and Iraq trading oil outside of dollar, Germany and China trading outside of Dollar, the strenghtening of BRICS bank etc, Dollar has been showing a steady decline. So India should also wisen up and start replenishing its treasury with gold and sell off holdings in dollars and euros and invest in other currencies on the rise. This is one reason BRICS could be very important for India and other countries in BRICS whether we like it or not. 

Another thing that using another currency would do, it would take away the power of the US to slap economic sanctions on whichever country they choose. This is one of the major reasons Putin has teamed up with China - in order to bypass US sanctions.

*[Edit: The thing that worries most nations is this - having international trade and foreign reserves in dollars gives US a single handed say on their economies. Just like Nixon's unilateral decision changed the fate of all currencies, other decisions by it can also change their economies. US can dictate their rules and if you don't follow them - sanctions. So the countries want to take back the power of making decisions in their own hands.*

*Next, the petrodollar is based on a commodity that is being depleted. Oil reserves are declining and the world is moving towards other sources - gree energy, nuclear energy etc. So the petrodollar decline is destined. However, what would US do next? They could shift to backing their currency with nuclear reserves or some new crazy idea out of someone's hat. That will, inevitably affect all other countries and they want to and should have a say in it.]*

On the other hand, China's attempt to start a gold backed currency may not pan out because like I said all the gold in the world is not sufficient to back all the currencies in the world. Also, since most currencies still have a large amount of dollar backing, fall of the dollar would make that percent of the currency valueless and therefore even having a reserve in another foreign currency could still cause a fall in Indian currency though it might be a little mitigated. On the other hand, fiat currencies are run by the investors' trust in the currency. So even if the dollar falls, a fiat currency with foreign reserves in the dollar may not fall because the confidence in that currency is still high. Sadly, such a currency would be Chinese Yuan. So, the policy to fix this? I am still trying to work on that solution. This is a post in evolution. My thoughts on this are still in evolution and I would really like some economists to come and hold a serious, well informed and sane discussion on this.

 I will add more when other points occur to me or are brought forward to me in any online or offline discussions.

I am yet to check out the links by some other users and I shall update the post with the links when I do.",concernadian," Very well written and informative article. Here important points to note:

1. China is trying hard to break the hegemony of dollar and taking every steps to convince other countries that Chinese currency is next best alternative to dollar given the turmoil in Europe

2. OPEC countries have reduced the prices of oil because they want all shale petroleum producers to go out of business as it is still expensive. US being major producer of shale petroleum will be hit by this. This might result in greater tussle between US and OPEC countries in coming years.

Despite all this US dollar will remain the back up currency for all nations for another 25 years until a group of nations like BRICS start a unified currency. But chances of this happening is very bleak at this stage. 
 Buy bitcoin, better yet buy monero That's a good write up. I've long called the petrodollar an incorrect term, it is better to call it the MilitaryDollar or NuclearDollar. As long as the US has more weapons and military strength than the next 20 countries combined there's no long term threat to the dollar. The medium of trust may shift from gold to oil to crypto currency or something else but, barring a couple of years of confusion,  the world will always come back to the US.

 OP, this is brilliant Also watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djwPqAJ_3GY *US currency is basically a petrodollar.*

I think this is an overstatement. Global trade in crude oil is just $700 billion while total global merchandise trade is $17,000 billion. So oil is just 4% of total trade. Even if oil exporters were to switch to some other currency, the impact on the dollar would be insignificant. Pricing oil in dollar may have initiated the rise of dollar but it cannot cause the decline in dollar.   

*Dollar has been showing a steady decline.*

Do you have any data to support your claim. Dollar index's value has been 96.5 in 2017 (based on monthly data). Compared to last 5, 10 and 15 year averages of 91.0, 85.1 and 85.8, respectively, the dollar index is higher by 6.0%, 14.2% and 12.8%, respectively. So dollar has actually been strengthening over the past 15 years. Really nice Article OP. It would be good if you can link some sources from where you got all the info. I had some questions though.

>This rate, in turn is linked to the value of the dollar. Stronger the dollar, more the interest on US Treasury bonds and more the foreign countries invest in it. Now this means that these foreign countries would much rather invest their money in US Treasury at an assured fixed rate of interest than invest it in 3rd world countries and take a risk of maybe losing it. However, if the value of dollar were to fall, the countries would much rather draw out of the US treasury and invest more in the startups in different countries, domestically etc.

Does this also not mean that the countries who have their investments already in form of bonds, will like to maintain the hegemony of USD?

>The other side of the same coin would be the countries dependent on US investment. Should the value of the dollar fall, the investment being received from the US would be of a lesser value.

Is this not basically the same side of the coin meaning that these countries too will be benefited in maintenance of status quo of Dollar. 

>The truth is 99% of today’s currencies US Dollar, Euro, Indian rupee, all of them are fiat currencies i.e. their value is not determined by the gold they hold but by the economic strength of the government. Only an average of 4–7% of any country’s currency is today, backed by gold. US Dollar - 4.5%, Indian rupee - 5%. The rest is held in the terms of foreign reserves in other countries like in the form of US Dollar (around 70%) in US treasury bonds, in world bank or IMF, in other currencies (around 25%) in BRICS and other foreign reserves etc. 

By this what exactly do you mean? Assuming that all countries have equal foreign reserves in $ (Bad assumption, I know), why will the exchange value of Rupee with rate to let's say Euro change if USD goes down? Further does a change in foreign exchange rate will be a cause of trouble for countries which are a not a net importing country? Meaning that if today, a home made bread loaf costed 20 Yuan, won't it also cost almost 20 Yuan only, if the exchange rate of Yuan with Euro goes down?

for the things he has done - which only he could have done! He #$_@ed the entire population of a country by demonetising them!!

No one else could even imagine that in their far dreams. And the next thing he did immaculately is **self marketing.**""

Edit:

Source: Ravi Nair on twitter [@t_d_h_nair](https://twitter.com/t_d_h_nair)",in3po," So, NDA is UPA plus cow? LOL I've been shouting this the whole time. He just renamed already existing schemes in Hindi, made some price revisions and boom! Achhe din! “Give us some time. Have some patience...Don't trivialize issues,” parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said. “Decades of Congress rule left India in a very bad shape. To expect miraculous changes in just six months would be unjust.”

This was BJP's response, back in 2014, when Congress accused them saying “This government has made 25 u-turns in the last around 180 days. That's an average of one u-turn every seven to eight days,” Congress general secretary Ajay Maken said, releasing the booklet Maheene Paar U turn Sarkar.

So it seems they've been using all this time to just rename all existing policies to showcase what tremendous work they've been doing.

What else can you expect from a government led by a man who famously said ""I should've managed media better"" Someone needs to make a whats App of this and forward it to all family groups. You have to appreciate Feku and gang for their mastery over marketing  To be added to the list:
Aajeevika Skills was renamed as DDUGKY.

Also, smth regarding PFMS -- can't recall right now.

Renaming a scheme and doing push ads is the fastest way to show the pretense of work. We have many good schemes and policies already in India -- what we need is better operations. But no-one wants to work and streamline operations because that's not sexy and doesn't really get you credit/PR. Oh and it requires actual work.

I'll go ahead and add, many renamed schemes are changing the definitions of the metrics being monitored and that is actually leading to added numbers.  would you please care to also include the links to the performance on all these missions/yojnas to really compare? 

Also do you seriously think these yojna/missions were discovered/invented by Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi themselves, one fine day shiting under a tree? Chances are these yojna/missions are brain child of the bureaucrats which surprise-surprise are the still the same for the most part. Elected ministers are mere enablers/decision makers and a true comparison would really be the performance report if you got any?

Congress has ruled the country for 70 fucking years, yes you will see the same yojna's going around for few years coz they were not able to actually fucking solve the problem. [removed] These schemes would have always been there in some or the other form, renaming has been done, but has ONLY renaming been done? That is the question to ask.

The Congress is in the best position and the best person to publicise these points, they themselves were the ones who rolled out these schemes. But why are they not doing it, maybe they know the facts that would come out of the discussion woukd be further detrimental to themselves.

Have you guys looked into numbers that these schemes achieved under UPA or NDA rule, I or II?

Have a look at this speech by Sushma Swaraj which is aptly suited for this argument https://youtu.be/c3nhX276Oj8 Sir, at least uss twitter wale bande ko credit toh de do. :) Still happy to see name ""gandhi"" missing from at least some schemes. Otherwise even public toilets are named after them. And btw, every gov does renaming part, congress too.",2017-06-12 16:43:35
Policy/Economy,"[R] US Economist: ""India's growth is only solid b/c it ignores the adverse effect of #demonetization on the massive informal economy"".

The Economic Times, however, took this completely out of context and published a story titled ""[India's GDP growth appears solid, said noted US economist](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-gdp-growth-appears-solid-says-noted-us-economist/articleshow/57477617.cms)"".

Do not trust the mainstream media. Doing your own research and digging up your own numbers will present you with a much better picture of the world.",rishsriv," A simple rule I have is that don't trust anything in the media that isn't a direct quote. Any interpretation or analysis by a journalist is good for garbage.

Anyway, I can't see that quote in the ET article you have linked to. Did you give an incorrect link accidentally or have they edited the article since?

Edit: Looks like incorrect link. You probably wanted to link to this article

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-gdp-growth-appears-solid-says-noted-us-economist/articleshow/57477617.cms I am not pro or anti modi on this issue, but has the informal economy ever been considered to talk about the status of Indian economy ? Were there years where the informal economy was doing better than what the GDP suggested ?  First two paragraphs:

> Noted American economist Steve H Hanke has said that India's economic growth for 2016-17 is appearing 'solid' because the GDP figures did not take into account adverse impact of demonetisation on informal economy. 


>""India's growth is only solid b/c it ignores the adverse effect of #demonetization on the massive informal economy,"" Hanke, an American applied economist at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, said in a tweet.

😂 Wasn't bringing the informal economy under the umbrella of the formal economy one of the objectives of demonetization? Informal economy used to be counted in GDP prior to demonetization? If not then why should it's impact be considered on GDP numbers now?  

Ideally demonetization's indirect impact should hopefully bring some part of informal economy in the formal economy. Why are you surpised? This is what Moditutes from Main Stream Modia do. Thanks for the observation. Its so commonplace these days that big corporations, institutions and world leaders just blabber some bullshit and people take their word for it and/or show complete lack of professionalism and/or intellect and somehow we just accept it. My understanding of informal economy is pretty limited, and goes like this. 

A guy buys a basket of mangoes for 500 Rs, and sells it in market for 800 Rs, rinse and repeat. Now due to demonetisation, his 500 Rs note is invalid, and he goes through hardship for a good part of two months, and now he has fresh currency, and goes back to the farm to buy mangoes, unfortunately, it is priced 700 Rs because the farmer wants to make back what he lost, and now this guy sells it for say 1000 Rs, rinse and repeat.

The informal economy died for a good 3 to 4 months and is back on. It will slowly adjust to the current demands of the market. People might shift fields, might have reduced income in some cases, but it will go back to its place once enough cash is available. Now that is my understanding of informal economy. 

Is that very far off from reality, please explain if so. 

Well, it was a shitty thing to do by the govt. People didn't need to suffer. The best way to measure the damage caused by it is to find out how many people died directly, how much mental suffering was caused by it(difficult to measure), I assume the latter to be a lot, and the former to be as close to zero as possible. But the govt clearly has no right to put its populace in such distress and will surely pay for it in the elections(or not, according to the pundits). 

What is the next course of action, that can be taken by people who are dissatisfied by it? To me, it seems like, since what's done is done, we need to predict how it is going to impact us, and do everything possible to prevent it from happening to us. Unfortunately, people don't want to punish them, but if we keep wasting our time shouting, looks like we won't have enough time to predict and prevent the disastrous consequences that are about to hit us. Waiting for the disasters to happen, so that we can say, I told you so, is not a viable option in this case, I believe, because it will affect us too. 

Truth will come out and punishment will be given in time. For now, the resources should be directed at predicting and finding ways to prevent it. 

That's my 2 cents as the saying goes.  I still haven't seen a comprehensive article that objectively analysis the long term affects of demonetization. It's all rhetorical jabs or opinions. Main stream media is really incompetent.  I think this is good..  its fine to grow the organized sector at the cost of the informal economy Doing your own research != Reading wikipedia You all should follow him on twitter, fun guy. do it now follow him although not all he says is true. also follow 5 other Economists on twitter it brings great knowledge and perspective to your life. But, in India, the informal sector is not considered as the part of GDP. The contribution is very less. Most people in rural areas are not part of the formal banking system. Whatever they sell(vegetables), are bought by someone who is also not a part of our economy.

We never considered them, so the adverse impact is also not considered. 

This demonetization will force them to use the formal banking system, so we can actually track down the informal business(90% employment). This informal sector also contributes to grassroots level corruption and inefficiency.",2017-03-06 02:18:49
Policy/Economy,Mandatory Aadhaar for IT Returns - Why make my Life MORE Difficult?,104,5p41u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5p41u7/mandatory_aadhaar_for_it_returns_why_make_my_life/,104,"I live in the US and file IT returns in India online through my bank - no paper trail. I don't have an Aadhaar number. Now I hear that the government is making it mandatory for filing IT returns. What the hell am I supposed to do? Make a trip to India just for getting an Aadhaar number?

I don't understand this. As it is, less than 2% of India pays income tax. Last year I paid 2.13 lakh in taxes and got a certificate from the government. But apparently I won't be able to to pay it next year! Why? Because of the damn Aadhaar number!

Why is the government making it MORE difficult for honest citizens to pay their taxes? Development is supposed to smooth things over, not create more hassles! Does the government want to LOWER the tax net? This is such bullshit! Take my fucking money quietly and stop making it difficult for me to pay you.

Signed: A frustrated tax payer.

Here's another article from Firstpost about it: http://www.firstpost.com/business/beginning-2017-18-quoting-aadhaar-number-may-be-made-compulsory-for-filing-income-tax-returns-3212456.html",BJPark," Aadhaar is not mandatory for filing IT returns.
PIL can be filed in Supreme Court if any govt Dept contravenes this order.

Incorporate your company in the US and take your business out of India.
 You live in the US, why do you feel obliged to pay taxes to the Indian Government? 

I live here and I don't like paying taxes, but.... let's just say I have to.

If govt. is making it hard for you to pay taxes because of ADHAR, then you should be happy. Stop filing those shit IT returns, pay taxes in the country you reside in. 

I ain't getting an ADHAR, so if the want tax but also adhar, they can very well fuck themselves around a tree. This is unacceptable. And it won't be implemented. I don't think you can get an aadhaar card even if you went to India. You have to be in the country for 182 days before you can apply. http://uidai.gov.in/images/aadhaar_enrolment_correction_form_version_2.1.pdf Tweet sushma swaraj What do you mean by mandatory? 
My PAN card name and Aadhar name won't match so I won't be able to submit the returns? 
OR they will remove the PAN card and move completely to Aadhar? Ever since Modi came to power, they have only focused on modifying Income Tax rules & tinkering with economic policies. All talk & no work on infrastructure, healthcare, education or preparation for Tokyo 2020 Olympics

I have Aadhar card & it turned out to be useless document. Applied for passport with Aadhar, PAN, Voter ID, savings bank a/c, 10^th passing cert, school leaving cert, IT assessment orders, etc & didn't get the passport... Application got stuck due to unable to bring proper witness for police verification. What's the point of having documents - esp. Aadhar? I had to stand whole time inside passport office (never got any seat) & deal with rude officers. Lost my Rs. 1500/- - I feel like getting scammed (for the first time in my life) despite having Aadhar card

It's really **frustrating** to do business in India due to [time-consuming & cumbersome approvals](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/licence-raj-replaced-by-time-consuming-approval-raj-biocon-cmd-kiran-mazumdar-shaw/articleshow/53490079.cms?from=mdr). Better gradually move your business within USA & file taxes to the IRS. 

Modi Govt is complicating things with extra paperwork creating bureaucracy & red tape. World Bank's 2017 [Ease of Doing Business](http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings) ranking proves that Avoided Aadhaar legally till now and now they come up with legal ways to declare all those who refuse to get into the Aadhaar fold anti-national. Wah Modi ji Wah. Especially when their stand was this just a few years ago https://imgur.com/a/2ZeMF

And we have a toothless Supreme Court, that continuously keeps saying you can't make Aadhaar mandatory and everyone keeps making it mandatory cooking up some link to 'benefit' availed from govt or the public exchequer.

If they really get this passed, moving out of the country will be the only option. I'm going to, if they did! The next time you come to India, get an aadhar. It took me a total of 2 hours for getting an aadhar with all documents. Or better tweet the indian embassy at where you live and maybe they can have one done there.

Ask your CA and stop relying on some news articles.

Stop whining and obey the laws of the country, if an aadhar is required, go ahead and get it. [People in the US get an SSN and other documents, similar wait periods/rules etc. exists, why the whining?] 

As a citizen, you are obligated to obey rules. You make money which is taxable in india, then better adhere to their rules. If not, then have your business elsewhere. What is so hard in understanding this?
 Maximum government, minimum governance. Ab ki baar, u turn sarkaar! Not only this they want me to fill new form this year 12BB.

The point is if govt want they can create a flat 15% tax slab and no other deduction. But no you can take 50K NPS , 1.5 lac in 80c , fuking LTA and fake medical bills. 


I know at least 100s of  people now who fake the rent receipt. 

Why govt is acting like a dumb ! Why can not they make things easy?

  If and only if you have an aadhaar card it's mandated to enter the number else you can leave it blank.  Don't worry. They will change the rules again in a couple of days. ;) WTF! 
I will have to file taxes too, and I will NEVER get Aadhar. Sorry sir, but I believe a single identification number for all Indians is long overdue. The US does not have a well integrated system with SSN, but other countries have very advanced single ID systems - benefiting residents and citizens . Using this number for tax payment, banking, employment, education and healthcare are steps in that direction.

Just like US citizens comply with the pay-tax-to-Uncle-Sam rule, just because they hold on to a passport that says 'United States of America' on the front and can open banking accounts in that country, you as an Indian citizen - have to comply with the taxation rules, or face consequences. ""Take my fucking money quietly"" is exactly what some corrupt officials have been doing previously. ""Stop making it difficult for me to pay you"" is exactly what a unique ID will allow the government to establish -- in the long run.

All this said, what I am *absolutely baffled by* is why did the government not just improve and extend PAN number (issue additional numbers) to the rest of the Indian population, as a unique identifier -- instead of creating a new Aadhar ID. Brother i totally feel for you. 
Aadhar is a new unique biometric for all indians and it has solved a lot of problems regarding documentation for a common man from land buying to jobs to buying a sim card to govt subsidies and i beleive it has rooted out major corruption issues. 

So let's say you have 10 bank accounts but govt doesn't know it coz banks dont share data amongst themselves, they make Aadhar number mandatory for all accs. You stop paying taxes and boom you are caught and cant escape it.  [deleted] I think the Indian problem is copying American systems. Thus we get American problems as well. This aadhar scheme is a parallel to the ""Social Security Number"" system in the U.S.",2017-01-20 22:07:21
Policy/Economy,The Rice of Wrath: How Obscure British Land Law and Free Electricity Created Economic Stagnation and Environmental Disaster in Punjab [Policy],21,86w3s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86w3s1/the_rice_of_wrath_how_obscure_british_land_law/,16,"Punjab has been the breadbasket of India since the colonial era. The British recruited heavily from rural Punjab for it’s armed forces, and recognized that is was vital to keep rural Punjab prosperous and satisfied. The government invested heavily in irrigation and enacted laws favorable to farmers. Famine nearly struck Bihar and Maharashtra in the after independence, and the new government was desperate to raise agricultural yields. The government of India embraced the Green Revolution, and no region more than Punjab. Punjab led India in the adoption of high value seeds, irrigation and fertilizer. An entire policy regime was constructed to benefit farmers and to increase food production.
However, this policy regime is misfiring badly today. The Green Revolution is over in Punjab, and the state is struggling to reorient itself in an economy where agriculture is no longer paramount. Free electricity to farmers to keep pumps running constantly, causing the water table to drop to dangerous levels while starving the state government of the funds necessary to modernize the economy. Today’s podcast episode is about the weight of history on economic development in Punjab and the struggle to transition from the successes of the Green Revolution to a truly modern economy.",gnikivar2, You cannot exactly say that the policy misfired. The policy was created to raise yields and it did do so. I would argue one of the most successful schemes of the Indian government. Well it is really no big deal that Punjab's growth has fallen. It always was a land big on agriculture lacking in mineral resources. There is limited growth beyond agriculture. The real growth nowadays is in Central India What podcast is this?

Policy/Economy,My experience with the answers of Quora on Government,64,749dxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/749dxv/my_experience_with_the_answers_of_quora_on/,29,"Before 2014 I was a daily user of quora but once they started there selfless work of promoting government for each and everything and when the crowd of wannabe top writer started throwing senseless answers on stupid question after taking weed. I was forced to quit. But I didn't unsubscribe from Quora digest.

Every alternate week I see there is a question on work related to government in Quora digest. And despite knowing what kind of answer it is going to have 7 out of 10 times, I try to read that. 
I have seen it all from giving them a little bit of time to proving how good demonetization was. 

There is usually a pattern in answers if the question is normal one like, how Modi is performing in his constituency then typically top response have this pattern. 
First, he will put a discloser why he eligible for giving this answer it could be, the writer himself belongs to the same constituency to he visited this place twice, one before 2014 and one after 2014. After that discloser,  couple of pictures from Varanasi in the night from the perfect angle where you can't see the filth. And with that, he will assure you that   Varanasi is literally transformed into a world-class city. Despite the well-known fact that Varanasi is not just restricted to Ghats of Ganga rest of the answer will focus on that, and there will be a rosy picture in front of you. The list put in front of you will mostly a daily news article like Modi gave a gift of x crore to Varanasi and there was a project that started only by great leader etc. Now, what would you expect from a guy who lives there is to put a picture of how his life is changed like electricity, roads and healthcare facility, he is getting after 2014, but no I will throw every random project news about Varanasi without the follow up on that project. Are bahi! ager news article ki project started or gifted vali news headline hi padhni thi to question kyu puchta. 

Another instance if the question is about the health of the economy or something like demonetization. Where people are vocal means, there is less excuse to make. Then ignoring all the facts on how government changed his stance from the attack on black money to increasing cashless transaction. The writer will simply put forward his own theory or a new theory produced by Sir Sambit Patra. One of the theory was now the government have a big database of people who submitted their money it will be easy peasy Japanesey to find defaulters. In the end, there will be some statement from hotshot banking firm head backing their theory and proving how India is headed toward glorious future. Despite the well-known fact how crores of money renewed through bank staff as well as through traveling agencies, daily wage workers, and jan dhan account.  

There are some instances where they pull legs on failed policies like make in India and poor river health but don't know how they forget the name of our beloved PM and his party in that answer. It's all about how bad Indian citizen then. If river Ganga is still filthy then only people are responsible about that because they throw religious material in it. But they closed eyes when Mr. Modi along with his fellas dropped religious stuff in the river during the live telecast of Narmada dam inauguration. 

Justification on how it is just cow cow and cow everywhere is simply it is not new, and it is going on from ages. It was Nehru who started all this. And our beloved leader is so good he never question his elders work. Then why would he question work of Chacha Nehru? He is just following his footstep.

Justification on why farmers are dying and rape is a big problem is again it is not new, and the X country is actually a top-ranked country in this. Just don't dare to question our leader.
One of the top writer and flag bearer of Indian diaspora on Quora said something amazing when asked why they act like the lawyer of government. 

> For the same reason Sachin, Steve Jobs and a variety of people are staunchly defended by their fans. You might not have agreed with every one of Sachin’s shots [especially the silly shots he got out] but would desert him for that?
Modi was elected by crores of voters. Some of these might have voted because they thought there is no alternative. But, there is a sizeable chunk of voters who voted because they believed. They believe this government is theirs and not some random entity like we have often behaved in the past.
If you assume Modi’s string of victories in state elections is a fluke and that a sizeable chunk of people don’t truly adore him, you don’t understand the evolving Indian politics.
In a way this is democracy - where people feel ownership in the government. Look at US politics and the same happens - where common people feel ownership and stake in politics and fight for their ideology.
When you believe it is yours, you will fight for it. 

Yeah, I will fight for it, and I will fight for every single penny I gave through tax and different types of cess. And question government why things don't change instead of supporting them for each and every idiotic move.",calvinwalterson," Question: Has India changed under Modi?

Answer: A BIG YES!

<insert random tweets made to govt>

JAI HIND! Quora is the best example of how education is useless without proper character or mindset.
  I was an avid Quora user till early 2016.


I used to be there for the vast amount of sensible answers on topics related to movies, science, tech etc.. Since I joined Quora around 2012, I had subscribed to the topic related to India, its politics and all. Gradually over the years, the indian population started sky rocketing. It turned into basically a facebook feed with pointless questions whose answers could be googled or despo ques by indian men. 

Post 2014, I noticed a tremendous shift in the type of questions, it was Modi everywhere. In the nascent stages of the government even I fell for the develeopment charade they were parading and many of the answers made sense. Little did I realise that the PR machinery was in full swing. Once the honeymoon period got over, you could see the cracks opening up. From the hike in railway fares to LPG to Petrol to Violence to Center trying to powergrab state assemblies, one by one the problems became visible.


This was the time Quora turned toxic for me. Literally every other question was about modi, 100s of answers on how he ate for 1 hour, slept for 3 hours blah blah started popping up. Most of it were utter bullshit. Side by side there were rumours that the BJP IT cell is in full swing trying to push propoganda on social media. With no options left, I muted all Indian topics and by mid 2016 left Quora for Reddit. 


Now after almost a year I went back. There are new players in town. The flag bearer of the Indian diaspora is being questioned on his pro-government answers. People are beginning to react back. Many top Indian writers who were fanboys of Modi are now seriously critiquing the government's policy blunders. The tides are slowly turning.


Not just Quora but I can see the same happening on FB too. Comment sections of newpapers are now pretty critical of the government. I know that this doesn't represent the entire country but I hope to God it does and the BJP starts to pay for its ignorance and ego.

I've said it then, I'll say it now. BJP won by a landslide not because the people loved BJP, they hated Congress after the scandals and policy paralysis of this decade and voted for Modi. You'll never know when the middle class and farmer swing votes will go the other direction.  Pre-2014 quota was great Quora has been invaded by the BJP/Modi PR army.

But don't worry. Have faith in ignorant Indians. Most educated voters don't take active interest in politics.  Man, Quora has been long before turned into a shitty forum filled with paid(most probably, because their IT cell is famous for this) pro-Modi army. Except reddit india, I haven't found a single forum on the internet that's not creeping with huge number of abusive right wing trolls since Modi has come to power. and I've heard stories about this forum as well. 

All those pro-government answers get like thousands of upvotes faster than the speed of light. My Quora digest was always composed of the people singing songs on the greatness of God's creation that is Narendra Damodardas Modi. I've stopped using that garbage dump since then. Balaji Vishwanathan(He is grade 1 a-hole celebrity on Quora, who knows nothing but praise BJP 24/7,hence highly popular and he's all numb since RBI figures came out after Demo), a few IAS officers and bunch of other popular accounts are all BJP inclined. A large no of random accounts keep posting pro-government propaganda and get huge no of upvotes despite their answer having NO substance or logic at all, including those having no followers and popularity. They are a part of Modi's PR machinery. Afterall this is the only thing he's good at. [removed] Please quora users leave reddit I was a lurker in quora, mostly adding it as search term along with my google queries. Used to get sensible answers, then I noticed the spamming. Everyone is copying answers, no curation involved, it was shameless. Promotions and copies and efforts to show off smartness in fields they clearly aren't. Cancer + Cancer = Quora One's Quora feed is the result of one's interest, upvote etc. Basically the topic you read more will appear more on your feed. That's how the algorithm works. If it bothers you just mute the topic ""India"". Problem solved. It works for me pretty well. ",2017-10-05 00:42:39

Post below and I'll add.

Note that I haven't included anything about their manifesto because I will give them 2 more years before we see any effect.",skang404," OP - Read this brilliant article by Pratap Bhanu Mehta - ""[A great deal of Agreement](http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/a-great-deal-of-agreement/99)""

Though few things have changed since Modi became PM, by and large the article holds good even after almost 2 years. Few points from the article:

* For all the hoopla over reforms,the development models of all political parties look pretty much the same: the particular differences are due to the timing and context when they were in power. 
 
* Both are incremental reformers. Both reform largely when impelled by crisis,and the variations in their stances are variations of circumstance not conviction. Both believe in the rhetoric of the poor first. 
 
* Both have roughly the same approach to institutions: they are instruments to be used by those in power,not instruments to protect against them.
 
* There is actually more fierce contestation and blocking of decisions precisely because there is so much underlying agreement. When there is deep consensus,the ground of the conflict is no longer disagreement. The illusion of choice. That's because there is very little difference between both parties, the way the BJP behaved when they were the opposition was **only to gain popularity**. In reality they supported nearly the same policies as the Congress but didn't want to let the Congress get credit for their success.


I think both parties are bad but the people who blindly worship the BJP like they are some sort of superheroes pisses me off.

Edit: Lot of respect for OP  for putting up sources for everything. People think I'm a pessimist and anti national when I am overly critical of the government, and even a liberal.  
I've been equally critical of congress government in the past too.   

The fact is that all governments deliver a lot less than promised. The most responsible and good citizens of the country aren't ones who blindly support their parties, but are critical and analyze all governments regardless of which side they belong, to keep them on their toes and hold them accountable. That's true democracy. Not just voting once every 5 years.   

Good work, OP.  One more - [Modi's time-bound promise to Assam and West Bengal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsXMqCnT5u8#t=0m37s)


To number 29, add the fact that they didn't even bother to fill up the CVC position for a long time, they appointed a panel recently after a Supreme Court rap.

 Prakash Singh Badal getting Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour of the country. Lost my faith in Modi Government after that. BJP is no different from other political parties in India when it comes to shoutfests and posturing in the media when they are in opposition and compromising when they come to power. 

Also, I believe that any political party should be pragmatic in their approach and stands have to be changed according to situation. U-turn today would have been the wrong turn years ago. Another point to be noted is that Modi was not at the helm of BJP when many of these statements were made. His personal stand might have been different and since he is in power, he has the ability to change these as he sees fit. Still there are many disappointing turnarounds.

That said, here is my take since I promised OP.

1. The major hangup (according to the article before) was regarding the guarantee of supply and tracking of nuclear fuel. [Indo-French deal](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/indofrench-deal-gives-assurance-of-lifetime-supply-of-nuclear-fuel-for-french-reactors/article133837.ece) has pretty much guaranteed lifetime supply for French reactors. What this would mean is that other nations would have to follow suit or will lose out against the French.

2. Henderson-Brooks is a major fuck-up. They should make it public. But I believe there are a few major bomb shells in there that is making the Govt hesitant to do so. The same hold trues for Subhas Chandra Bose fiasco as well.
3. Aggressive posturing for vote bank, but the basic theme has not changed. Calling Sharif for inauguration was a good move. Gave us diplomatic leverage. Pakistan issue is something we have to live with. Only thing Government can do is to increase covert ops, strengthen intelligence, and speed up arms procurement. Something Parrikar has been doing quite right after years of fuckups.
4. AFSPA is still in effect. Its a draconian law and should be used in the right proportions. The after article mentions that BJP will govern in such a way that AFSPA will no longer be needed. No U turn here. They never advocated for permanent AFSPA.
5. See 2. 
6. The major issue raised by BJP during that timeframe of opposition was that they did not take the opposition into confidence. Secondly, the illegal immigration from Bangladesh has reached its heights. BJP wants to cut down on that and dealing with exclaves is the first step in that process. 
7. Retarded to oppose it in opposition. A definite U-turn that I would support.
8. Uma Bharti talked about 3 years. If you look at the 18 years plan, it talks about short term changes in 3 years, medium term of next 5 years, and long term of next 10 years. There are things happening in the ground level. An example: http://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/PGSRzzCh7mDVIn7c5kGLaP/First-phase-of-Clean-Ganga-campaign-to-be-completed-by-201.html
9. A definite U-turn and something I don't like. Aadhar and UID has been badly managed, but the other option to let go of the 1000s of crore spent on the project. A pragmatic approach would have been an audit to check the discrepancies in the system.
10. Modi was against not giving fitting reply to ceasefire. This time around the response was not something mild. http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hits-back-with-vengeance-strikes-37-pak-posts-15-killed/article1-1272821.aspx
11. Has BJP said anything about not giving Delhi full statehood? 
12. Whats the U-turn here? BJP supported the old bill and wanted changes in that. In 2015, they are proposing a new bill with changes that they see as fit.

Will reply to the rest later as you fill them up. Not a BJP supporter. The problem I have with people justifying this as ""changing for the better"", is that if BJP is going to stick to Congress policies, what is the point of voting them in?

Every criticism of BJP govt gets you 2 responses - either ""Congress was worse"" or ""You're an anti-national"". The opposition currently is Congress so it's easy to pick on any point they raise as ""Why didn't you do this yourself"". It's bullshit. The two parties keep flinging shit at each other for the same actions on the same issues while common voters get taken for a ride.

To be honest, I was happy under Congress rule, there was much less vitriol in the govt communication. There were no govt. cheerleaders. The ruling party didn't make their supporters feel like ""victims of secularism"". I think I've said this before and I'll say it again. I'd rather live with scams than communal hatred.

Btw, one inaccuracy 

> BJP u-turn on Vadra? Before After

[Just an ordinary man: Airports begin removing Robert Vadra from no-frisking lists](http://www.firstpost.com/india/just-an-ordinary-guy-airports-begin-removing-robert-vadra-from-no-frisking-lists-2114317.html)

 Continued from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3727an/how_does_bjp_justify_this/crj4dop)

13)  Not a U-turn. They obviously need to setup more crisis centers.

14) U-turn? They are passing a anti-black money bill. Other investigation is in progress. Less said about 15 lakh the better.

15) Something wrong with your links. They seem to point to FDI in insurance and pension and not retail. Anyways, retail FDI is still in progress. They seem to be going back and forth. I am personally for FDI in retail with strict guidelines on product stocking.

16) BJP was always for GST. Modi had issues with compensations for states by the centre. UPA made no efforts to take states into confidence and push forth on GST. Another angle is the increase in grants given to states by NDA.

17) BJP was and is against complete privatisation of railways. Privatisation in select areas of railways was always on the cards.

18) With fiscal deficit in a bad shape, I would imagine the Government shy from doing something drastic like that. I believe with GST roll out, more tax reforms will happen next year.

19) 20) 21) No political party worth their dime wouldn't protest against the hike. A bigger picture is to what they are doing to curb these things in the long run.

22) They haven't changed the cap afaik.

23) Good thing they did a u-turn.

24) Nihal Chand's case was thrown out a few times before he was made a minister. In any case, he should be sacked for missing court dates. Not because he is an accused. Kurien's case is the same, but its rather distasteful for him to appear in a global meet for women. Suryanelli case is very well known in Kerala. His appointment came a few months after High Court accepted a petition from the girl.

25) BJP does not say it. An MP said. He was [reprimanded](http://www.ibnlive.com/videos/politics/venkiah-tobacco-panel-aatish-979185.html).

26) Links are all wrong. Jan Dhan Yojana and the insurance schemes are the best things this Government or any Government for that matter has done. Bring something substantial to criticise.

27) Before investigation they alleged that. After investigation they couldn't find anything. I would be wary of a Government that would not do a U-turn in this case.

28) I don't see a u-turn here. Does it say BJP is weakening these institutions?

29) See 19)

30) U-turn? Modi hasn't said he wouldn't dismiss the Governors.

31) U-turn? What I see is an attempt to speed up bureaucratic processes. They should have kept better checks and balances.

32) Khemka got a raw deal. BJP at fault here.

33) Political parties should not come under RTI. But there funding should be transparent. We are far off from reaching there.

34) Chidambaram says and its the word of truth? They are not the same schemes. SBA absorbs NBA and adds a whole lot more.

35) As much respect I have for Antony, he is a fucking moron and the worst thing that could have to the Defence ministry. The new deal immediately brings fighters to India that our force desperately needs.

36) 66A and net neutrality are different issues. Don't club them. Net neutrality is still an ongoing topic. 66A is draconian and should go away. It would activists and relentless pressure on legislative and judiciary to take that away.

37) An MP said it. Most likely out of context. 

38) Unnecessary dharna for somethings that could be resolved with talks? And the backchannel talks did resolve instead of the dharna. Modi's dharna afaik was after rounds of failed talks. 

Great job on the links. [removed] [deleted] Gdp and growth numbers being touted look suspicious as fuck http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/little-sign-of-modi-cronyism-in-stock-market-trends/#_ga=1.81772503.1912375169.1432447443

""Dhirubhai Ambani was a notorious Congress crony and master manipulator. It’s somewhat ridiculous for his companies to be called BJP cronies by Rahul. Businessmen have always had to pay off the party in power, the Congress being the top beneficiary. But today businessmen complain that they cannot buy influence any more. A Mumbai industrialist told the Economic Times, “We fund many parties but with Narendrabhai we can’t expect a quid pro quo.”"" BJP has the same broad policies as INC. They have a better record with old school corruption mostly because they haven't been in power that long. 

But given its a right wing party so there is a strong under current of religious fundamentalism, conservatism, historical and cultural upheaval agendas. I'm not a BJP supporter (they haven't earned my trust and they probably won't), and I don't have context for all of the points raised, so I'll only try to answer the ones I am able to.

\1. N-deal 2007 vs 2014. That's literally more than one term of government. Tactics change after each term to meet the pressing political scenario.

\3. Antics played by an incompetent opposition to maintain the resemblance that they're actually an opposition.

\4. In 2011, the NC was ruling, and the BJP felt that AFSPA couldn't be removed under that government. In the second part, my understanding is that they would have used the JK legislature to start the process to get rid of Article 370 if they had had a majority in the J&K government.

\5. Politics; nothing new to see here. Modi met Bose's one of relatives this year and said he would ""consider it"", which is obviously a stalling tactic.

\6. Opposition being an obstructive opposition.

\8. There's no real intent; probably trying to ""please"" the industries, who would have to shell out cash for improvements to their drainage systems. Also not allowing ash-dumping in the river would virtually make people go up in arms against the government. 18 years gives them a lot of leeway.

\9. They were against it, but Nandan Nilekani met the PM and pitched it to him, managing to convince him to let the program stay. That's what I read in the news a month or two after the elections took place.

\10. Politicians being politicians.

\11. Revenge for voting AAP to power. 3/70 hurts. See the tamasha that is happening at the moment? Grant full state-hood to Delhi, and stalling the AAP becomes impossible (AAP's also incompetent and complains too much, but that's a different topic).

\12. You quote an August 2013 article as *before* and April 2013 as *after*? Seriously? I don't even see a fucking U-turn because the BJP *helped* the Congress pass the bill.

>BJP u-turn on black money? [Before: ""15 lakh""] [After: ""Jumla""]

\14. No citations on your part, but Narendra Modi had said that there is so much of it abroad that on bringing it back it would be enough to give 15 lakhs to everyone. That doesn't mean he promised to give everyone 15 lakhs.

\15. They were really two-faced about this. All the while when they opposed it, they actually helped the Congress push the bill through the Lok Sabha.

\16. An obvious case of ""I want to score political points"".

\17. I don't see how allowing FDI is equivalent to allowing privatization. Privatization only happens if they allow the private sector to control the system.

\18. No, just politics. They didn't lower the limit, so it can't be called a u-turn.

\19. Their excuse is adequate. Re-planning the budget would take another month and cost a lot of money.

\20. A continuation of policies. It's quite normal to see that happen.

\22. Opposition being opposition. Name one country where the opposition doesn't do a u-turn once in power.

\25. Government doesn't endorse his view.

\36. I don't fucking see net neutrality in either article so don't fucking slap words in just because you want to. On 66A, during the legal process, the government was the defendant, it couldn't withdraw the litigation or anything of the sort. The case was continuing from UPA2 and my belief is that the government's counsel told the government that the only thing they could do at that stage was defend, and not suddenly change their opinion.
 Didn't read them all. But first 10 are actually not related to real development within country. [removed] We all understand that BJP and Congress are pretty much the same. 

The difference is that under Congress, I was never accused of being a ""deshdrohi"" for speaking out against the PM.

BJP likes to brand itself nationalistic, but a lot of work it has done as opposition by stalling development is patently anti nationalistic [removed] /r/uturn  : This subreddit is dedicated to the Bhartiya Janta Party of India, U-turn experts > No.25: BJP says in parliament, ""Tobacco does not cause cancer"" because Shyam Bidi's owner is an MP?

Did the party say this or that bidi person say it? He is just speaking his business. Is he a spokesperson, minister or something?

Edit: I think the BJP/NDA govt should look at this afresh. Thankfully it seem they are doing something about it. 
http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/first-signs-of-rethink-in-tobacco-panel-pm-asks-nadda-to-probe/

People employed in that industry is not a reason to not act on tobacco given its impact on health.  BJP is worse off than congress on many fronts - conservatism, hindutva etc. However, the difference is that, Congress truly lacked a leader while BJP has a good leader.

Society is very complex. Even if things are not good, a good leader can swing the mood of masses making them perform better and thus boost the economy. And one startling change between this government and Congress is the ability to take conclusive decisions. This is what the industry is betting upon. [removed] [removed] really? Most of the links are not even u-turns. A spokeperson said this, ally wants something completely different - that's not a u-turn. One bjp mp says something and a different mp says exact opposite - this is not a u-turn either. This is called difference of opinion, also known as inner party democracy.  Again, one can hold a no talk with pak policy even as you invite pak pm to swearing in ceremony. It's not a u-turn. U turns are reversal of policies. In that all I can think about are FDI in retail and nuclear deal with US - and I am glad BJP did that, as that's the sound position. 

Just how clueless do you have to be OP when you label antony (who never moved a file in 10 years as defense minister, and damaged armed forced inventory beyond repair) accusing parrikar as a u-turn? 

As for people showing this to claim all parties are the same, bjp and con are alike etc.. really? No party is like con for nobody has mastered the con game like them.

1) family over country. 

2) hierarchial party with the family vetoing everything. Why elections then? When the elected MLAs and MPs are loyal to the family and not their constituency. Having a congress MP or MLA is as good as having none. 

3) puppet PM as front for family, and the family associates loot.

4) trillian dollar worth loot. Forget the islamic invaders, forget the  british, nobody looted india the way congress did. 

5) and to top it all, yes men in every nook and corner of society covering for their ill deals doing PR jobs for them and hack/hit jobs on anybody opposed to them. Government posts, non governmental orgs, media, social activists, you name it. 

Between a drama queen kejriwal, and scam hungry congress, the choice is a no brainer.  Can you provide specific citations instead of mentioning u-turn everywhere? Would be helpful for people to get a better picture. Otherwise, I wouldn't qualify this beyond another rant. Lol, I have nothing to add to these threads, but just lurking, atleast the AAP thread had questions. 

u-turn is not a question, there's no context here and adds no value to me. I'm assuming your purpose would be to educate the layman, but you aren't doing that at all. The 14th point is stupid. Tell me where Modi/BJP leader says they will deposit '15 lakh' in every citizen's account.

That was a figure of speech- similar to saying every Indian is under X rupees debt because India, as a country, is under debt.

I am an AAP supporter and I loathe BJP. But please don't lose common sense. My answer would be either lost in this torrent of intellectual discussions or be heavily downvoted **by you know whom**. I could not resist the temptation. So here is it.



I am a pure lay man. These are the points as to why  i will again and again favour the BJP , which i had been doing so right from my school days even when my whole family was for only the Congress.


1) Every one in my family has availed of the insurance schemes that the government has offered us. Very easy to fill these forms. I have recommended this to my maid servant and every body that I know off.  Why the previous government  could think of such schemes for only selected communities is what irks me. Now the whole nation benefits. I feel this is an awesome scheme and I am going to benefit very much from these. ( I do not work in a big MNC. Am in the service sector)



2) Way back in 2004 I knew that there would be a whole sale conversion to Christianity in our country. It happened too. I do not have any thing against that religion. Infact i visit the church quiet often. (I love Jesus . It his $@$##*^%$$$# zealots that I abhor.)  But I detest the fact that my nation is losing it's identity, culture and its great glory of , tradition and  Philosophies. Sonia and her 2 children will definitely , silently, insidiously turn my countries' illiterate mass into the religion they were born in.


3) I continue asking quiet a few young adults about their political views. I live in Bangalore. Perhaps this phenomenon  is only  here. But the  all whom I ask are totally for BJP . The most favorite comedian among youngsters is not Johnny walker, Vivek or anyone else. It is Rahul Gandhi. 

You know what the young people say as to why they are pro BJP  


"" BJP might be corrupt but they are 10 % corrupt while they contribute 90% But this is vice versa for Congress "" is what  they say..





Edit: One day I might vote for the AAP or any body else, but never ever for Sonia and her children.


 When did they uturn on GST? Here's my answer.

BJP is way better than any existing political party. 
People here love to accuse any bjp supporter as blind supporter*.

Congress -> can Indian origin people lead the country please? People laugh at indians when they know about the italian origin leader who ruled us for a decade. Shame. In a country of 1.2 billion you couldn't find one leader? Don't gove me the crap mms was the leader of upa. He wasn't. 

AAP -> first, tell us how to deal with anti-national naxalites. In case of war with pakistan, what will kejriwal do? After the ceasefires across the border stopped, it is clear how modi would shut pakistan up.


A comparative study will give you an unbiased view. Instead of focusing what government didn't do. I am focusing what is government doing.

So far very much satisfied. 

10/10 will vote again. Whoa.  Quite a list there you have. But despite these u turns, I am still with them for these five years. 

If the BJP govt isn't doing any good for the country,  they'll be thrown out without shame in the next general elections. 

Let's see what happens.  Personally I am happy with most of the u-turns. There are some false allegations and some misinterpretations in the list. Many of them are not even u-turns. When in opposition they demanded some changes and when in power they brought those revisions in the bills, deal, policies etc.

Voted Modi for his ability to get things done and non-corruption. And he is doing fine on both counts. 1. Politics

2. Modi was never in parliament was he? I am tired of such posts by AAP fanboys. If your response to Kejriwals U turns is ""Hey! BJP is doing it too!"", then stop living and peddling the illusion that you are a different party. AAP is the only true party which drives straight.

edit: 

> Dharna is anarchist, but BJP can do it? 

I read that link. I think you should read it too. Dharna per se is not wrong, it is the way to protest/dissent in democracy. However, it should be done in formal manner. Let police be aware of it, route of procession and a lot of other things so as to help divert the traffic and what not (as it happens in case of Ganesh Visarjan/Muharram), police force arrangement for safety/risk mitigation etc

It becomes an anarchy when people gather in numbers and cause disruption to rest of the people who are minding their own business. for e.g. people used to stop trains when something didnt happen per their expectations. I find this stupid and police should beat their ass up and straighten them. There are ways to protest, this is not the right way to do in a society where your actions can affect other peoples lives.

Did you get that?


edit2 : Reg other points, some of it is state subject other is central govt. The devil is in the details but who cares to read?

regarding Pakistan, you might have felt the difference in the way the situation is handled by border forces/army.
i.e. beheading of jawan/ceasfire violations etc. do you see these things happening now?


edit 3: reg Rafale jets, read swamy39. He threatened to go to court against his own party gov if they didnt cancel the original deal (per him, the deal had commission for Sonia & Carla bruni-Sarkozy and no one was willing to buy those aircrafts). The deal was cancelled and a new deal was placed per him. You dont have to trust him but you have to have prove him wrong or prove that it was a u-turn.

You cant go by headlines of newspapers/channcels and use that as a basis because you know there are ""krantikari"" journalists and media is messed up.  [deleted] [removed] Bjp is just another name for congress.When Vajpayee was at helm there was difference,but now its all same.
 I'm saving this thread to show my office mates who wet dreams of modi.Oh the joy I would get to rub this on their faces.I always tols them at the end of the day he is a gujju and they are snakes behind the grass.I never trust their entire community of cheats,liars and hookers.they have their way to convince people with their theatrics but then the reality is entirely different.Never ever give power in the hands of Gujratis.They sell their own mothers if the deal is good.India is a piece of land for them.and a fortune one at that.",2015-05-24 12:18:40
Policy/Economy,[Ask] Why central and state governments are failing in job creation?,16,57kl2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/57kl2h/ask_why_central_and_state_governments_are_failing/,17,Is it possible for governments to set up new companies to improve job creation? Or do we have to amend old labour laws? What about land acquisition issues? Do we need a new land acquisition law? Is grabbing a land from citizens and giving them some peanuts is acceptable? ,Raghavcm," How about crony socialists not call bharat bands when labour laws are to be amended? Govrnments don't create jobs. That happens only in Marxists countries. 

Otherwise government is enabler not provider. in an open economy as India is vying for government role is not active participation. 

They need to create laws and be ahead of the curve. For example: That fucking fucktard of fuck shit land acquistion bill has been pending since the first time I read the century old law ! Like since 10 yrs chutiyas are still debating and with every revision you are eroding the rights of the original dwellers of the land. Development can not happen at the cost of a community .. .cause when that happens, the capitalist gets the profits and the welfare costs of takign care of the community falls on government, which increases overall expenditure of the state. 

So we need our governments to do these and not work on creating jobs. 

1. Economy - Open economy - Let people from outside come and and minimise protectionist policies that we seem to create to enable competition. Competition will not drive away kirana stores .. Competition will not kill small industries ... 

2. We need to attract high calibre industries for which we need skill based labor. I mean its not like indians cant import the right technology but we for fucking fuck sake cant seem to find the right type of people to do the job. my family is waiting since ever to open an industry in Andhra but damn fuck everybody is in an engineer and yet dont know what the hell does a machine does. Matlab hadd hai. We need skill based strong industrial complex ! 

We need to create a skill based tertiary sector asap for job creation. 

- Labor laws - Big overhaul and again not at the cost of eroding unions ... 

- and can we just kill communism and these systems which have are holding back states from advancing. West bengal has been ruined ... just looking at the state's debt makes me feel like this https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.128773031.6122/flat,800x800,075,f.u6.jpg
 [deleted] Coz giving jobs is not the govt's business.. I know it might sound rude but it is the truth..Days of socialism or crony capitalism is over.. Capitalism in it's true sense needs to be implemented. Government should allow 100% FDI in multi-brand retail. Will bring in a lot of jobs. Because our government is pro-businessmen, not pro-market. No plans. Just PR. Right now we are int he phase of selling and eating our public sector enterprise sales' proceeds. I wonder what will happen when those assets run out.",2016-10-15 12:37:18
Policy/Economy,Sardar and Legacy [Spiritual Translation of Two Marathi Articles],2,9tsmlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9tsmlb/sardar_and_legacy_spiritual_translation_of_two/,3,"The credit for integrating almost all princely states, barring three, before 15 August 1947 undoubtedly goes to Sardar Patel. But he was of tired body and mind post-independence and post-Gandhi assassination.

It's one thing to like historic fables and another to consider them history. There are often efforts to sell these fables as history. But it's time to look for true history. Currently certain fables are sold as history. Some of them are: Sardar Patel was Hindutvavadi and subsequently anti-Muslim, if he was leading the country instead of Nehru then all of our problems (i.e. Pakistan and Jammu-Kashmir) would've been solved already. Due to wishes of masses, these misunderstandings are considered history. There's effort to sell these fables as history.

First let's tackle most lethel delusion. That is had Mahatma Gandhi not put his weight behind Pandit Nehru, then Sardar Patel would've been our first Prime Minister. A most liked fable in halls of Whatsapp university. Reality however, begs to differ. Pandit Nehru wasn't chosen as Prime Minister at the last minute. It had been going under consideration since 1929. At that time Purna Swaraj (Declaration of Independence of India) under consideration which was officially announced on 26 January 1930. It's leadership came easily under Nehru because he was 2nd most popular leader of Indian National Congress after Gandhi. Then there was a challenge of elections as per Government of India Act 1935. For that, there was no other option than to handover the party presidentship to Nehru. The popularity necessary to win the elections was with Gandhi and Nehru. Sardar Patel was main fundraiser and chairman of Congress' Central Parliamentary Board at that time. However it meant Nehru had bigger responsibility since as a President, he was the face of the party. That is the reason why in 1942 Gandhi declared him as successor. The whole party stood with him and so strong was the resolve that in 1946 - a year before independence - Maulana Abul Kalam Azad resigned presidentship for Nehru.


It's interesting to check the delusions of people who claim Sardar should've been the Prime Minister. After his release from prison in 1945, he was not in good health. He was struggling with diabetes and blood-pressure and his mind was gloomy because of family issues. He had severe heart attack on 4 March 1948, barely a month after Gandhi assassination. Even doctors had given up hopes. Sardar survived but it took a toll on his health. He had said that next news won't be of my sickness but of my death. He died in December 1950. He didn't live to see first general election in India. Nehru was 15 years younger to him. Sardar belonged to generation of Gandhi and Jinnah and three of them died shortly after independence. Sardar Patel's own words are enough to remove any doubt about his desire for Prime Ministership. ""Desire demands youth and health. We have none."" He even conceded that the crowd at Bombay rally had 'come for Jawahar, not for me'.

This should tell us how unrealistic it is to claim Sardar for PM.


Now let us talk about partition. Sardar Patel was one of the first people to agree to partition proposal by Mountbatten. Nehru accepted it later. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on the other hand, staunchly opposed partition till the end. He was of the opinion that India shouldn't be divided. He himself had written it in his 'India Wins Freedom'. It might be politically incorrect to speak highly of Azad in current political climate. But it is documented history. Patel was first one to accept the truth that it isn't right to make Hindus suffer for dream of Undivided India. Nehru and Gandhi followed him to accept the bitter reality. So all three of them are equally 'responsible' for partition. It is  politically convenient to blame partition on Gandhi and Nehru. But it isn't reality. 

Finally, let's talk about his love for Hindutva. He had none as documented by many historians and journalists such as Narhar Kurundkar, Govindrao Talvalkar, Ramchandra Guha, Rafiq Zakaria, even American Vincent Sheean. He had major role in giving religious roles to Indian Muslims. Minority Institues also have special rights thanks to Patel. He never opposed leadership of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan in Northwest region, nor did he oppose Shaikh Abdulla in Kashmir. Not just that, but he never felt to limit rights of Indian Muslims after creation of Pakistan. It is also history that he had admonished Uttar Pradesh's then Chief Minister  Govind Vallabh Pant after idols of Rama were placed in Babri Masjid in 1949. He was of the opinion of resolving the matter through talks. There's also no example of Patel giving different treatment to Hindu and Muslim rulers of Princely states. Hindu Maharaja of Travancore intended to stay independent. So there's no reason to claim that Patel's politics was motivated by religion.  Infact, his outlook towards RSS changed after Gandhi Assassination. Even though the ties between RSS and Gandhi Assassinations were never proved, he was of the opinion to ban it along with Hindu Mahasabha. 

----

A reader called me to accuse that ""your favourite JRD had said, if Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today"". I spoke with him and by the end of the call he had change of heart. Why? Let's see.

History tells us that Gandhi's economic policies were opposed by Nehru and Patel and two of them also had difference of opinion about it. Nehru's economic policies had layer of naive socialism. Which gave birth to state-owned enterprises. It spread so much that goverment was making wristwatches. Nationalization was core of his economic policies. It's as if he hated the idea of profit. 

JRD and Nehru had disagreement about this point. JRD was of the opinion that it's not government's job to run airline company. It should be noted that JRD's favourite child, Air India was nationalized by Nehru. Patel agreed with JRD on opinion that businesses should be left to businessmen. JRD's opinion was in this context, ""if Sardar Patel was a younger mand and had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today""

Now the caller didn't take into account Patel's health. Nor did JRD speak about Nehru's popularity and politics. His only focus for comparison was economy.

Now let's come to present. Nehru's economic policies were criticised by many political parties, including the one currently in power. The criticism includes inefficieny, irresponsibilty, unnecessary hirings and expenses etc. 

Narasimha Rao took stand against this love for state-owned enterprises. Him and Manmohan Singh opned the doors for economic liberalization. Rao was throughly Congressman. But he didn't hesitate to throw policies of his predecessor in the can. Atal Bihari's government came close to Rao's. He pushed privatization and sold state enterprises operating at loss. As a member of BJP he had right to can Nehru. 

Now Vaypayee's party came to power in 2014. This part is business-friendly and progressive. So it was a given that PSU's will get evem more freedom. Sins of Congress had resulted in loss in banks, air india, and other state enterprises. The BJP's admiration for Patel meant that even more economic improvements would be done. As a sign of their admiration, this goverment decided to build a monument for Patel. So far Congressis had ignored Patel so these people decied to build a statue so tall, you could not ignore it. That's how you pay tribute to your heros!

Around 3000 crores Rupees were spent for this glorious monument. Who paid for it? The caller didn't know. 

So this is the list of generous people who contributed to this monument, in Rupees:

- Indian Oil - 900 Crores

- Oil and Natural Gas Commission - 500 Crores

- Bharat Petroleum - 450 Crores

- Hindustan Petroleum - 250 Crores

- Oil India - 250 Crores

- Gas Authority of India - 250 Crores

- Power Grid - 125 Crores

- Gujrat Mineral Development Corporation - 100 Crores

- Engineers India - 50 Crores

- Petronet India - 50 Crores

- Balmer Lawrie - 6 Crores

Does the list ring any bell? All of these are Government owned companies. Who were born because of Nehruvian economics and policies,  which was opposed by Sardar Patel. And his monument is now funded by the same companies.

And the money comes from Corporate Social Responsibility funds of these companies, even written down for preservation ofr arts and culture by some of them.

Who is preserving whose which legacy? Food for thought.",ArchangelleSnek," Link to original articles:

Policy/Economy,SaveTheInternet.in is live. Status Check on Net Neutrality consultations - June 2016,192,4n4o1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4n4o1d/savetheinternetin_is_live_status_check_on_net/,129,"**tl;dr**

Preconsultation paper on NetNeutrality is just the first step of that process: consultations on throttling and VoIP will follow. Have to prevent fast lanes for the throttling paper. We're likely to lose the battle to prevent licensing of VoIP.

Free data paper is very tricky and we're now opposing databack models, after further examination (explained below). 

[SaveTheInternet.in](http://www.savetheinternet.in) is now live, in case you need help mailing the TRAI. We have only 8 days to go till the deadline. 

We'll publish our long submission tomorrow for public comments.

**Longer version**

So, we have two processes going on right now, and a third and fourth coming up soon. First the easy stuff:

**Preconsultation paper on Net Neutrality**: Includes all the issues remaining from the consultation last year in March, when all of us got involved for the first time. /u/shadowbannedguy1 has a submission he sent to this. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4lucjl/the_trai_has_a_new_consultation_paper_on_net/
Important to note that this isn't a consultation but a preconsultation paper. This means there's more to follow. O_O

**Consultation paper on Throttling:** will follow after the pre-consultation paper mentioned above. We have to be careful about telcos getting fast lanes for specialized services, and also them having the ability to charge netflix and youtube a congestion fee, because it takes away from the rest of access.

**Consultation paper on licensing of Internet Telephony**: will follow after the consultation paper mentioned above. It is likely that the two consultations will be separate because the TRAI can regulate throttling under QoS (Quality of Service), but it can only recommend licensing of Internet Telephony/VoIP. I remember hearing that the VoIP consultation will take place in July, but you never know. This will be a tough one to win (as in, no licensing) because the MHA wants it to snoop on your calls, and pretty much everyone in the government would want access to VoIP. Telcos are arguing regulatory arbitrage, and the DoT had recommended licensing. TRAI seems to be open to the idea of recommending this. To quote the TRAI Chairman: 
“An application is providing the same service that a telecom company is providing. TSP provides the service under a licence, communications-based OTT don't provide it under any licence. There is a regulatory imbalance.” [Source](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/52528968.cms)

**Now the clear and present danger**

**Consultation paper on Free Data**
TRAI has issued a consultation paper on free data, looking at models which allow giving free data to users. It says now that it is considering models which allow an independent platform (not a telco) to zero rate itself, or give free data for how much data was consumed. We hadn't focused on this extensively in the last consultation and we thought data back was kosher, but on further examination, we're don't think it is: We're opposing data back related to consumption of data because it has the same impact as zero rating of an individual site or a group of sites. The only difference between this model and airtel zero is that data consumed is being given back to a user after data usage, instead of during data usage. So, I use 11.3 mb of wynk, and the platform gives me 11.3 mb. It doesn't dictate that I use the 11.3 mb only for wynk, but it has effectively made my cost of using wynk zero. The TRAI chairman has also made some worrying statements:

“Free Basics had essentially tied up with Reliance Communications. So, if you went through the Reliance pipe, these sites were free. If you went through the Airtel or Vodafone pipes, these sites were not free. It's as though a shop in (Delhi's) Connaught Place is giving discounts but to only those who come in a bus provided by Mr X. If you don't come by that bus, no discount. That is not a good thing. If you give a secular discount, it is fine.” [Source](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/we-had-a-problem-with-free-basics-because-it-gave-free-data-only-to-those-who-went-through-rcom-pipe-ram-sevak-sharma-116053000014_1.html) 

[SaveTheInternet.in](http://www.savetheinternet.in) is now live. We have only 8 days to go till the deadline. 

P.s.: Apologies for the delay, but many of us had to go back to our actual jobs (and a couple of us had a pretty big mess to deal with because we were away from work for most of last year). So it's been tough getting ourselves going again, but a few of us have put in a lot of work over the past four days on this. This will be our 5th participation, after TRAI, DoT, Parliamentary Standing Committee and TRAI again, since March last year. 

You'll also notice that the submission is from the Internet Freedom Foundation. We have set up a non profit because we think we need to get more organized. More on IFF and its plans soon.

#Please read this before blindly copy-pasting SaveTheInternet's response to the TRAI's consultation paper regarding Free Data

It is that time again. TRAI has given out yet another consultation
paper, and the deadline is near. And yet again has STI come up with a
canned response that many of you will copy-paste and send to the TRAI,
perhaps with minor modifications, perhaps even encourage your 
friends and family to do the same.  People have already started 
congratulating them for the great work they are doing. In this
atmosphere of self-congratulation, please allow me to insert a
dissident note, and try to convince you why you might not agree with
their response this time, even if you agreed with their responses
earlier.

First of all, consider their stand regarding services that ISPs
provide on their closed networks.

>Content which is on the Internet should not be allowed on the CECN,
>because that would be circumvention of the CECN.

>A movie that is available on the Internet should not be available on
>a CECN for a discriminatory tariff.

If this isn't proof that these guys have completely lost it, I don't
know what is. What is next? A movie that is available on the Internet
shouldn't be allowed to screen in theatres too, I suppose.

Please pause to consider the implications of this stand for a
minute. Any content which is on the internet can't be a shared on a
""closed electronic computer network"". This means that you can't share
files, music, movies that you legally own on your LAN. You can't even
distribute open source software on your LAN. Just think what kind of
problems such a regulation would create for universities or companies
which have a large network of computers to manage. They wouldn't be
able to install or update any software through the LAN. This isn't
saving the internet, this is killing the LAN.

I get it, you guys hate the ISPs. To a large extent, they deserve your
hatred. That doesn't mean that you need to piss over the rights that
they should reasonably have. If they have bought the rights to a movie
or a song, and want to distribute it over their network, I don't see
why anyone else should have a problem.

Coming now to their responses to the main questions posed by TRAI in
this consultation paper, the major problem with their response is that
everywhere they have taken the approach of treating ""net neutrality"",
""discriminatory pricing"", ""zero rating""
as first principles. If I summarize their entire response as ""Net
neutrality is good. Zero rating is bad. Free data is like zero
rating. Therefore, free data is bad."", I would not be simplifying it by
much. If you remove all the sentences from their response that rely on
these assumptions (that is do not argue on the basis of more
fundamental principles like promoting competition, not allowing entry
barriers for startups etc), you will be left with less than five
sentences. Even if you are against allowing platforms that provide
free data on certain websites, you would probably want to argue from
more fundamental first principles. If you read the consultation paper
carefully, the TRAI does not view free data as inherently
contradictory to their policies regarding net neutrality and
discriminatory pricing (otherwise they wouldn't have even floated this
consultation paper). By reducing yourself to just these two points,
you are unlikely to make an argument that TRAI finds convincing.

My own stand regarding all this is that I agree with their point that
providing discriminatory powers to ISPs is anti-competitive. However,
I don't see free data as something that is inherently
anti-competitive. **Besides, given that a lot of people in our country
do want free data, I consider it our moral responsibility to at least
honestly consider the question whether we can find a model for free
data that is not anti-competitive and does not hurt the interests of
startups etc. And this to me is the biggest problem with
SaveTheInternet's response to this consultation paper. It makes no
attempt whatsoever to look for such a model.** If you are concerned
about discriminatory powers that a platform providing free data might
have, why don't you suggest the TRAI to consider a model where the
platform *doesn't* have those discriminatory powers?

Ideally, I would like a framework where any  web services may be
allowed to reimburse the ISPs for the data usage of their users on their website. The
mechanism of how this reimbursement is done, whether through rewards,
a toll-free API, or direct money transfer approach is quite
irrelevant. The important thing is that ALL companies should be able
to use this framework, and it should not be locked via agreements
etc. As long as that is there, I don't see how such a platform will be
anti-competitive, or hurt the interests of startups in any way.

I am sorry that I don't have a ready-made response that you can
copy paste to the TRAI. **If you care about a fair playing field for
startups, please take the time to study TRAI's consultation paper on
your own and write your own response. Don't be lazy. For fuck's sake,
do not outsource your thinking to a bunch of clueless activists. Most
importantly, don't just blindly send this extremely flawed response to
TRAI.**

I will end with a line from an essay by Saadat Hasan Manto. “We’ve
been hearing this for some time now — Save India from this, save it
from that. The fact is that India needs to be saved from the people
who say it should be saved.” Please save the internet from the people
who say that it needs to be saved.


Note: This comment was originally a [self-post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4n96hm/please_read_this_before_blindly_copypasting/), which I am reproducing on the sticky as a comment for visibility. There was a lot of healthy discussion on that post, which you can view if you want.

  Toll free model is again Zero Rating with a fancy block diagram.

However if a service wants give reward user with data (non discriminated - which can be used to access any site) for using its service, I think then there is nothing wrong in that. For Ex: Freecharge model where they give 100 MB as reward when user accumulates 16 tokens (~RS 800)  Have you guys gone back to give even a half a thought about the revised proposals? Can you give even one reason why you think that they are anti-competitive? 

Is this campaign about protecting an enabling environment for startups at all, or is it just about pissing on the rights of poor people? Its funny how the Save the Internet crusaders are marching against the very same model, that they had proposed when fighting against freebasics.

And this one is far more worse than FreeBasics. FreeBasics actually helped poor people, or people on the fence, to get on the internet. This is just giving away freebies in order to attract more footfall to their website without actually removing the digital divide.

Net Neutrality is more like a Neutered Net. Whoa, a nonprofit! I hope you guys accept interns.

The biggest thing about the Throttling Consultation that worries me is that even long-time net neutrality advocates have little familiarity with how traffic management actually works in an ISP. By sole virtue of having more experience than consumers in this area, I worry that internet providers' arguments will get more weightage.

Also, what is your opinion about the peering services I mentioned in my response to the pre-consultation paper? Do you think such programs should be allowed? On one hand, it feels kind of underhanded on the content providers' part (namely, Netflix and Google). But on the other hand, without its Open Connect program, Netflix's data usage during peak hours would literally be *higher than the entire Internet backbone's capacity (~3Tbps)*. Not able to make my mind up here about what would be best for the internet.

Also, it's pretty disturbing that the TRAI is against discriminatory pricing, but is biased in favour of TSPs when it comes to VoIP regulation. 

If we overcome throttling and VoIP regulation, India can be the first country in the world to have true net neutrality. i dont give a shit to net neutrality.. we have a bigger issue that is bandwidth and FUP shitty plans... people cry too much for free stuff.. why not do something about 512kbps FUP limit The idea of restricting what CECN can do is pushing the definition of Net Neutrality beyond its limits. Intranets and internets are beyond the scope of NN and suggesting TRAI to regulate it is ridiculous. The idea of tagging contents as Internet and intranet is asking for the impossible and hence trying to shutdown a legitimate business.              
Also nice point in lamenting about the multiple consultations If you are asking for regulations in the first place. Is the plan to swamp people with papers or something ? >So, I use 11.3 mb of wynk, and the platform gives me 11.3 mb. It doesn't dictate that I use the 11.3 mb only for wynk, but it has effectively made my cost of using wynk zero. The TRAI chairman has also made some worrying statements:

I can't consciously draw the line before this as wrong.  To me its purely in gray territory,  so I guess Imma take myself out of the equation  in this case. I think you guys forgot to put favicon on   SaveTheInternet website. The last date for submitting comments on Consultation paper on Free Data has been [extended to 30 June](http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReadData/WhatsNew/Documents/Press_Release_no44_free_data_Extension.pdf).

Its Still The Start of What we can call as War On Our Internet and Freedom To Access Internet,there are few more papers coming and all these questions have been addressed before including defining nn lets put a simple def to it equal price and treatment for all websites/apps its as simple as that dnt involve data bits and other technical stuff because telecoms are giving a twist to it and i will like to urge those on twitter to keep this message pinned to your profile for next one week

Mere RT will not Work and for this one week Whomever u talk online on fb or twitter or email or whatsapp share this link of savetheinternet and ask them to vote its now or never and we are trying to give inputs to NASSCOM and Other People for forming their Response But we Dont know how it will turn out at the end of day lets hope for the best

From ops own posted articles so people using zero rated plans are mostly poor and uneducated with no means of using other type of internet. 


>This group was overall twice as likely to have little to no primary school education, compared to
users of other mobile data services; however, 42% of these users reported having at least some
college education. Our survey also showed no diference in the likelihood of males or females
having ever used a zero-rated service, or using zero-rating as their primary means of accessing
the Internet. Finally, and somewhat unsurprisingly, this group also spent the least on weekly
data purchases — 38% of respondents who reported using zero-rated services as their primary
means of accessing the Internet spent less than US$2/week on data, the lowest among all
types of users. 


For what are the people using these plans 

>The most frequently reported benefits of using zero-rated services were: (1)
supporting education (17% of all zero-rating users surveyed); (2) health (15%); and (3)
accessing content about the community (15%). These benefits were also the most
frequent responses among all mobile Internet users surveyed. 

> Our first research brief found that zero-rating plans accounted for just 13% of all plans on offer in
our eight countries of study; perhaps unsurprisingly, our surveys found the actual proportion
of zero-rating users overall to be quite low — just 10% of users.

AMA about China, India, the U.S, or whatever!

",OReillyAsia," Can you tell us about the general attitude of the Chinese government and it's people towards India? How different are the opinions of the people and the government? 

Can the Indian government do anything to improve its perception in China? What an excellent AMA!  Hello Brendan.

My first question to you is that what do you see in the future of Xinjiang Autonomous Region? Is the separatist movement (if at all) of Uyghurs demanding East Turkestan strong enough that it would pose any significant challenge for China in the future?

Secondly, do you think Sino-Indian border issues will be resolved in the near future? Especially with the fact that there have been reports recently describing the Chinese involvement in the militancy in North-East India?

Lastly, about the China Pakistan Economic Corridor. China has been investing heavily in Pakistan for some time now especially in Gwadar, Balochistan. What threats/opportunities (if any) does it pose to India? Also how important is to the Chinese as compared to its Silk Road project?

Thank you for your time. I've flared this ""politics"" because I suppose politics are unavoidable when talking about Sino-Indian relations.... According to you, is China sincere in its talks of friendship towards India? If not, do you see a war in near future? Hi Brendan! Thanks for doing this.

How ~~serious~~ sincere are Chinese in settling border issues with India? What is the most acceptable solution in Chinese circles? Do you see it happening in next 5 years? can you TL;DR your book? [deleted] Hi Brendan,

I have 2 questions:

1. I was in China recently and it amazed me how far behind India is infrastructure wise. You really have to see it to believe it. We keep saying 'Make in India' over and over, but what is your opinion of this whole situation?

2. I was really surprised when I found out that all of google is banned in China (youtube, gmail, etc.) and the Chinese people I spoke to dint even give it a second thought. What do you feel about this? Which of the two political systems do you see as more sustainable in the long term? I've listened to and read the pros and cons of China's one party system compared to India's complicated democracy, but I'd like to hear an outsiders view.  Hi. I would like to read your book, since I feel a lot about China is obscured in the mist of nationalistic chest-thumping in India.

I believe China is a viable ally, but how far do you think they will go to arm or defend Pakistan? Is India's intrusion into the South China sea more likely to create a more aggressive Chinese ally for Pakistan?

 I have several questions. My knowledge about modern China is pretty limited.

1. What was the Cultural Revolution? Did it try to create a united identity for the Chinese people? Or did it aim for something else?

2. How is the culturally diversity in China? When I try to compare it to India to compare similarly sized societies, it is difficult for me to believe that it can be very monolithic.

3. Follow up question. Is there diversity among people who identify themselves as Han Chinese? How does this diversity manifest itself in terms of peoples identity? Do they have a strong regional identity like Indians?

4. I visited Seoul a few weeks ago and saw that most of the consumer goods and other electronics in use were all made by South Korean companies. I understand that this is because they are very patriotic and try to support local industries. Since China produces a lot more of consumer goods, do you see the same phenomenon in China?

Thanks!

Edit:Typo Hey Brendan!

How much do the Chinese invest in their people? I'm talking about infrastructure to support creativity and personal growth (something as simple as public playgrounds, maybe)? I'm not necessarily looking for numbers - more of mentality and thought. 
 * What is your assesment about the progress of the 300+ reform items laid out in the 3rd Plenum session in 2013.  
I mean how complete is it in percentage terms and how many years are left to go.  

* Do you agree with the recent article by Daniel A Bell, that CCP will in few decades re-brand itself, i.e. China will be ruled by the same people but under a different umbrella.  

* Is Xiaomi going to defeat Apple in the Chinese market, what's your perspective from on ground.  

* Your take on the Chinese cant Innovate narrative of the Western media press.   
Which sectors do you see China doing better than others and which do you see them lacking. Possibly do a take on this to include India as to how India can cooperate and compete given the status of those sectors in China.   


* Can HSR work in India in your assesment or was the Chinese pace of construction on it just a one off never to be replicated on that scale.  


* Why is TheDiplomat so anti-China in its bias and tone, is it because it deals with English language authors mainly and majority of them hold unfavourable view of China anyways and the lack of native Chinese language thinkers.  

* Who do you follow from among the various China Experts/Watchers. By follow i don't mean just twitter and all, but overall, whose work and views do you give more respect and credibility relative to the rest.   
And if possible whom do you not take seriously. 


* Which resources (online-Chinese or Global), papers, books, newsletters, feeds, etc do you use to keep up to date and use in your work/views.  Hi Brendan,

 I'm a little active on the motorcycle travellers' scene. All of us are waiting with bated breath to have China open up their borders for vehicular/motorcycle travel from India to China and beyond. 

 What do you think the obstacles are and can we see the opening up of borders for tourism and travel in the next decade?

Thanks! How religious are people there? I am not well read on this subject, but I'm guessing Buddhism and Confucianism would be the most common religions. Neither of these are ritualistic, but how does reality compare to this? Are the people superstitious when it comes to their beliefs or is it a more ""quiet"" part of their lives? 

This is a really good AMA. Quality questions and quality answers. Kudos to the organizers, the community asking the questions and Brendan! When AMA announcement was done I searched Brendan O'Reilly and I got pictures of well built mixed martial artist. Then I looked at your proof picture and I got a potato. 

My question is when will you hit the gym?  What's China's game plan in Indian Ocean and south China sea There are more English speakers in India as compared to China, how does it change the western media media outlook towards both the countries?

How 50 cent party is different from as of paid volunteers hired by the national parties in India?

What we can expect from China in future regarding India- Pakistan relationship?  How true are claims that there is a disjoint between the Chinese army in terms of its relationship with the government? There were talks of a sort of clash between the two when the Chinese premier visited India and the border escalations suddenly went up.  [deleted] Do you think, Any of the Economic policies taken by India with regard to Manufacturing and services, Anyway threatening China's domination in the respective sector.
Does it effect any geopolitical environment in the region? I work with Chinese people everyday. I find it difficult to communicate with them in English which is understandable given the fact that Chinese is the medium of education in China.
Don't you think the current language policy of China needs to be altered in order to accommodate English?

P.S: I do agree that we ought to give priority to our native language. At the same time, I can't dispute the fact that English is the de facto language when it comes to international communication. Obligatory question
Noodle or chicken curry???  what should i be doing in order to be a political writer one day? Hi Brendan, thank you for doing this.

* 1 Do you think that the Chinese also have this concept of Manifest Destiny that the Americans had / have (jury is still out on that one), only in this case, it is to restore China to the head of the world order?

* 2 What do you think about the Chinese soft colonisation of Africa? It is already breeding resentment in pockets of the African elite, but is this being recognised by the Chinese powers that be?

* 3 What do you think about India's look East policy started by PVN and ABVP? Is it being received well or antagonistically by the Chinese? After all places like Vietnam have always been in China's Sphere for the most part. 

 How strong is the pro-democracy movement in China. Is it still in infancy stage or is more developed? Do you see China becoming a democracy in next 20 years? After Japan and USA, who are the major foreign villains as portrayed by Chinese media? And since communist party is opaque, how does one know about the actual events and decisions unlike.. say Indian policy making? Finally, how much truth is there in Epoch times claims about an insider as part of central politburo?  Hi Brendan, 

Non political question here. I want to visit China. What are the places you would recommend visiting  China has a state run English news channel for international broadcast with foreign journalists. Do you think the Modi government might go in that direction on the lines of CCTV and RT ?

Is the international CCTV helping the Chinese government? Hello Brendan,

As a commentator on international relations how much are you hopeful for increasing the focus and importance of people to people relation rather than just trade (B2B) or political (G2G). between not just Indo-china but globally. 

is it against the interest of Geo-eco-political-Global order?

Do you see BRICS development Bank as an alternative to world bank

How SCO and BRICS can reshape the destiny of Asia for better

do the marginalized people of China face similar deprivation than in India.

How independent is Chinese judiciary,  are their any path breaking judgments on freedom of Chinese people. 

How is average Chinese life in rural areas

so many questions, thanks for reading them atleast What's the situation for employment of Indian expatriate workers, particularly in aviation and engineering related fields? 

 Hello ! On a non-political note, P.K just made 100 crores in China ! How popular is Bollywood in China ? What are your ideas about the China funded APT attacks that are happening on Taiwan, India and even the US(past two months)? Protecting cyber infrastructure for civilian companies (not military contractors and govt establishments) is becoming increasingly difficult for Infosec personnel in the region. 
We can identify based on our analysis that most of these attacks are by PRC and SK. Can you share your thoughts on this? Hi Brendan, 

(1) How is religion viewed in China? Are Chinese people largely non-religious, or is Buddhism and Christianity becoming popular? How do people view religions of other countries?

(2) What racial views to Chinese have, say for whites, blacks, indians etc? Also do Chinese people view Japanese, Koreans or Tibetians as separate races, or people of the same race with different cultures?

(3) Would you say the Chinese government functions like a meritocracy or a corporate entity? Does it realistically have any ideological goals presently, or some sort of a future vision? Or is it just ""taking care"" of the country by making policies based on pragmatic needs?

(4) What is the goal in life of an average Chinese person? What do they look up to in an ideal man or woman? How is this different from India? Do Chinese parents also influence decisions about career, marriage and kids in their children, like Indian parents do?  At this very moment, are you typing from China? Is Reddit accessible from China? 

Thanks for doing this. :) Are people happy in China. One of my friend who stayed in china for years said that chinese prople are afraid of rulers for centuries. [deleted] Hey! Thank you for doing this. My questions:

What is the best way to learn mandarin?

How important is it that India acquire a blue water navy?

How does India's naval strength match up to China's naval strength? 1. Was the recent stock market crash surprising?
2. What is its impact on the Chinese economy?

Thanks! Hi Brendan, my question is regarding the theory of sea lines of communication plan of China, the so-called ""string of pearls"" model.  

A recent report suggests that India seeks to counter this by establishing it's own String of pearls to contain China.  
Is this true and if so, is it, as the article suggests a reactionary check on China's influence in the Indian Ocean? 

Source of article: http://m.firstpost.com/world/modis-overseas-ambitions-vietnam-and-the-reverse-string-of-pearls-to-contain-china-1781389.html

Thank you for your time  How did you learn mandarin? Could you suggest any websites or any reference material you used to learn mandarin Hi Brendan,

What level of importance do the chinese give to the acclaimed Indian connection of Bodhi Dharma.

Do they tend to ignore it or do they acknowledge it? [deleted] * How different do you see the attitude of the Chinese administration of the 70's to that of present day, towards India?  
* What in your opinion would bring India really close to China in terms of economy?  
  
EDIT: Also, can you shed some light on why the Dalai Lama is so hated in China? 1. What's your favorite Chinese counter-culture?
2. How talented are Chinese political cartoonists?
3. Did you meet a Chinese corpse walker? [deleted] Do you see China supporting NK in the near future?  Do the Chinese have a clearer understanding of what India is like or is their understanding as weak as that us Indians have of the chinese? How different are Chinese and Indian people according to you ? 

How different was China and India compared to what you imagined ? 

As a person who has lived in both India and China, what have you learned from both the countries ? 

What do you think both the countries should learn from each other ? 

What are some things that you've realized after living in both India and China that are often not known to people outside or misunderstood ?

Sorry for asking so many questions. I wanted a neutral perspective for my answer. Most of the Indian media and people are biased when it comes to China and Pakistan, including me. Thanks a lot for giving your time. btw can you speak Chinese ? Or any Indian language ?  With respect to India's interests, is the current NDA government dealing with China any better than the previous UPA government? Hi Brendan,

China's bull run in the economy seems to slow down and India's is expected to grow, according to recent trends of dip in the manufacturing economy and growing knowledge economy. In the light of these equalizing trends(which are equally conspicuous by the Modi government's proactive actions in the foreign policy sphere as well), do you think that, like David Malone would ask, **""Can 2 tigers(India & China) occupy the same mountain?""** Who is your favorite kpop artist ? What's your ""go to"" swear word in Hindi ? Are Chinese People happy with how their government functions? Hello Brendan . This subject is really fascinating for me. Here are a few questions :- 

Do you think that there is a mass desire for democracy in China that could eventually be sparked in the near future? 

How do the Chinese people and the communist party feel about the appointment of Modi as PM ? 

Do they feel uneasy about the prospect of India becoming a major economic competitor in the near future? 

How do the two nations compare in terms of international relations? 
I mean China has a lot of leverage over  some major developing  countries and its global trade partners would stand to lose much in case they decide to oppose china is some way. India on the other hand is seen as a relatively peaceful nation with great potential but limited capabilities and influence at present.  

Sorry about the multiple questions. I would be content if you even answered one. 

Thanks a ton for doing this  
 oh wow haha I was going to comment ""*Why the hell does this have anything to do with India ?*"" then I noted the comment count.

OP were you surprised ? How is the Indian food in restaurants, on average, in cities 2nd-tier and up ?  Hello Brendan! Thanks for the AMA. Thought I was late or would have asked earlier.

I have ""what if"" type of questions for you. I can understand if you refuse to speculate. 

1. Assuming that the Indo-China border was settled in 1950s peacefully, do you think India and China would have any reason to be antagonistic later on? 

2. Also, assuming relations remained peaceful, what would the geopolitics in South Asia be today? Thanks for the AMA Brendan. Are the chinese, as a race, really as homogeneous as its government claims?

**India officials trek through villages to map rising joblessness** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: As India’s infamous summer heat started to rise this April, hundreds of researchers began a trek through villages and cities seeking answers to one of the country’s enduring policy puzzles — jobs. The answer could shape Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election bid in 2019.

The South Asian nation’s most ambitious jobs survey to date will reveal annual employment numbers for the whole country and quarterly estimates for its growing cities. That’s a significant change from the current system where the latest numbers are at least one-year old.

More From Livemint »

“This data will bridge a huge gap,” said Pronab Sen, country director at the New Delhi-based International Growth Centre and India’s former chief statistician. “This survey will give us an idea of the size of the GDP of India’s informal sector — there’s no other major economy with such high levels of informality,” he said. More than 90% of workers exist in the grey economy — unaccounted for in any official statistics — which complicates efforts to track unemployment.

India has so far lacked a reliable policy tool in the form of real-time employment numbers to help policy makers and its central bank. Labour is governed by both federal and state governments and data collection is scattered, with seven federal agencies publishing reports, according to the Statistics Ministry.

Poll promises

Before sweeping to power in the biggest election win in 30 years, Modi appealed to young job-seekers — more than half of the population — with a promise to create 10 million jobs. Three years later it remains unclear how many positions have been created. While his critics say Modi’s biggest failure so far has been his inability to increase formal employment, officials in his government say the claims of jobless growth are a “bit bogus.”

Bloomberg

Failure could risk voter backlash over jobs — an issue already driving protests in some parts of the country — and lead to even more divisive campaigning in the lead up to the country’s national elections.

“The nation will come to know whether prime minister Modi has been able to fulfill his electoral promise of creating jobs,” said Satish Misra, an analyst at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. “It will be an answer to India’s unemployment puzzle.”

Jagdish Thakkar, a spokesman in the Prime Minister’s Office, didn’t return calls seeking comment.

Disappearing employment

While India is one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, employment creation in eight sectors, including textiles and automobiles, was the slowest in seven years, according to a 2016 Ministry of Labour report. More than 12 million Indians enter the workforce every year, government data show. Between 2011 to 2015, the number of agricultural jobs reduced by 26 million while non-farm ones rose 33 million, according to McKinsey Global Institute.

Bloomberg

The government has trained more than 700 researchers to feed data directly on to tablets instead of the usual paper questionnaires, according to Rakesh Kumar, additional director general of the National Sample Survey Office.

More than 100,000 sample households across 7,500 villages and 5,000 urban blocks will be questioned every quarter to generate closer-to-real-time information, creating seven quarters worth of credible and comparable quarterly and annual labour data for the first time, Kumar said. The first tranche of data is expected to be revealed in December next year.

Data delinquency

The survey may also be the first set of comparable economic data from India since 2015 when Modi’s government initiated changes to how the nation plots economic indicators like inflation and gross domestic product. Policy makers and economists have puzzled over new GDP and inflation calculations that catapulted India to become the world’s fastest-growing major economy.

The picture was muddled further in November last year after the prime minister overnight cancelled 86% of currency in circulation.

With its landmark goods and services tax launched on 1 July, calculations used to compile GDP and inflation data are also expected to be out of sync for at least a few months.

Yet, in a country where fewer than 5% of people declare their incomes and 1% pay income tax, the GST will help improve GDP calculations by making available high quality, granular data, according to Neelkanth Mishra, managing director and India equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG.

Timely release

India’s decision to use Soviet-style five-year plans to plot its economy is another reason for the country’s data delinquency, Mishra said in a phone interview from Mumbai. Modi replaced those plans with a three-year strategy released earlier this year by the government’s planning body NITI Aayog, which discusses “high-productivity, high-wage jobs”.

Yet, there’s some apprehension about whether the government will keep to its timetable to release the labour survey. The task force formed last month under NITI Aayog’s vice chairman Arvind Panagariya recommended an employment survey every three years.

“It seems the data may not go in his government’s favour as there is not much evidence of job creation because of slow down of economy and demonetisation,” said ORF’s Misra about whether Modi will release the jobs survey findings next December. “In that case he will not allow the data to be released few months before the election — if he releases, it will be a bold step.” Bloomberg

Policy/Economy,India bullying Bhutan?,49,6q4rou,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6q4rou/india_bullying_bhutan/,36,"I came across this post in my FB feed where a Bhutanese woman was criticising India in an International Relations forum. It is a great read and a different perspective altogether. It would be great if you guys can share your views on the post. 

WARNING - Long wall of text

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHO IS BULLYING BHUTAN?

On 26th June 2017, The Times of India posted a video on YouTube claiming to show Chinese and Indian troops jostling and shoving each other on what The Times commentator said is “Indian land” on the “Indian side” of the Sikkim border. He accused China of “aggression” and the Chinese troops of being “extremely aggressive.”

A few days later, it emerged that the dispute had nothing to do with Indian land. The China-India confrontation was taking place on the China-Bhutan border. Yet Chinese and Indian media quickly roused patriotic fervour and railed against each other.

Chinese media said India would be “kicked out”, “taught a bitter lesson” and “suffer greater losses than in 1962. One Chinese editorial mocked India’s claim to be defending Bhutan and accused India of treating Bhutan as a “vassal state” and forcing it to support India.

Meanwhile an Indian headline read: “China: The World’s Bully”, and another article called China “a geopolitical bully….The mere fact that a vastly bigger country like China is indulging in such antics against a peaceful neighbour like Bhutan shows the extent to which Beijing will stoop to, to occupy territory illegally, slicing it off like a salami, just like it's done with India.”

Through such welter of mutual recriminations and accusations, Bhutan’s media remained remarkably quiet and reserved, with “no aggressive posturing”, as reported by the Hindustan Times. And why should there be? The vast majority of Bhutanese have no interest in the remote, barren, high altitude Doklam Plateau, and have not even heard of it.

But the 89 sq.km. parcel does have strategic importance to India that sees Chinese presence there as a “dagger” pointed at its narrow and vulnerable 21-km wide “chicken’s neck” that links it to its northeastern states. And so, Bhutan’s initial quiet restraint was not good enough for India, and Bhutan quickly fell into line.
On 3rd July FirstPost headlines read: “Bhutan vents out first major disclaimer against Chinese, sides with India…” The article went on to say: “Bhutan, for the first time has taken a major stand against China's incursions …. Bhutan's stand against Beijing… goes on to show the country's unwavering alliance and support for big brother India.”
And that characterization itself raises a big question: Who precisely is bullying Bhutan? And what exactly are Indian troops doing on Bhutanese land in the first place? Just defending poor little Bhutan against big China’s bullying “aggression”? Who, in fact, is more seriously threatening Bhutan’s sovereignty and independence – China or India?

When “friendship” turns to control.

In fact, India has maintained a strong military presence throughout Bhutan for half a century, exercising its power and influence in every corner of Bhutanese life. Even in the remote and strategic areas of northern Bhutan, far from anything Indian, Indian soldiers exercise their authority and control the movement of local Bhutanese. Convoys of Indian military trucks travel freely across Bhutan and cannot be checked for contents by the Bhutanese authorities. The Indian army has occupied the Haa Dzong for decades, and has given no indication of handing it back to the Bhutanese. The Dzongs have since the time of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the founder of Bhutan, been a seat of power and a symbol of governance.
It is noteworthy that Indian troops’ efforts to block Chinese road construction on the Bhutan border are portrayed in Indian media as stopping China from building roads into India – revealing just how little respect the Indians really have for Bhutanese “sovereignty.” But such spin is not surprising. In Bhutan, the IMTRAT (Indian Military Training) General, and Indian Ambassador both residing in the two most prized real estates in the capital, are said to be the most powerful men in the country, even determining what does and does not get published in the national media.

When Bhutan obtained Asian Development Bank funding for a strategic highway linking its east and west, to avoid the necessity of Bhutanese travel through troubled, strike-prone and often violent Assam and West Bengal, India vetoed the plan. The highway was cancelled and Bhutan remains dependent on India’s grace and mercy for its own internal east-west transit. Just a few weeks ago an angry mob of Indians beat up a Bhutanese truck driver and set his truck on fire for being involved in a road accident.
But this Indian interference and infringement on Bhutanese sovereignty extends far beyond the military-strategic sphere into every aspect of Bhutan’s political and economic life.

Thus, Bhutan is the only sovereign independent nation in the world that has no diplomatic relations with any of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members – the US, UK, France, China and Russia – only because India, jealous of its exclusive hegemony over Bhutan and fearful of any competitive influence, won’t allow it.
Japan has long been a friend of Bhutan, helping fund many developmental projects in Bhutan. The Japanese wished to have an embassy in Bhutan, to foster closer ties and more development projects. However, firm plans and agreement to build a Japanese Embassy in Thimphu were abruptly cancelled, once again due to India’s disapproval.

When China invited Bhutan to exhibit at its Shanghai EXPO in 2010, offering a free pavilion that would be a central installation in the EXPO, India forbade Bhutanese participation. Independent sovereign nations from the world over took part in the EXPO sans Bhutan. India, even if they forbade Bhutan, went and participated in the EXPO, even building a pavilion of their own. India regularly nixes Bhutanese official and commercial missions and visits to China, though it conducts its own with impunity, apparently due to Indian disapproval of potential competition with its own overweening influence.

More ominously, India has blatantly interfered in Bhutan’s elections and political processes. India strongly objected to Bhutan’s former Prime Minister forging extensive new diplomatic ties and carving out an independent foreign policy, and was furious when the Prime Minister simply met and talked with China’s Premier at the Rio + 20 conference. And so, India decided to get rid of him.
Just days before the 2013 elections, India removed its subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene, thereby doubling and tripling prices on these essential commodities, to signal its disapproval of the existing government. The cynical tactic worked, and a new government far more compliant and obedient to India’s will and interests was elected.

Hydropower – cooperation or colonization?
But the cornerstone of India-Bhutan “cooperation” for three decades has been the hydropower that is a cheap power boon to India’s growing economy, and which accounts for fully 40% of Bhutan’s revenues and 25% of its GDP. Indian financing, which has switched from 70% grant and 30% loan to 30% grant and 70% loan at higher interest rates, is also the direct cause of Bhutan’s escalating debt that has even further deepened Bhutanese dependence on India.

Since, July 2006, when Bhutan and India agreed to develop 10,000 MW of hydropower from ten large projects, the benign sheen of this apparent cooperation has quickly faded as commissioned projects were delayed and costs mushroomed. Costs jumped $US 240 million at Mangdechhu; they doubled at Punatsangchhu–II, and they tripled at Punatsangchhu–I (from $US 500 million to $1.5 billion), and no end in sight.
And those costs obviously don’t include massive environmental damages for which future generations of Bhutanese will pay. A recent report from India documented severe impacts on water bodies and resources, forest and wildlife loss, and heavy pollution. The same report, reinforced by Bhutan’s own government statistics, notes that hydropower has failed to develop local capacity and employment, with most contracts going to Indian companies.
According to the IMF, Bhutan’s government debt now stands at a whopping 118% of GDP up from just 67% six years ago, with India by far the largest creditor, accounting for 64% of Bhutan’s total debt. By comparison, India’s ratio of government debt to GDP is 70% and China’s is 46%. Why does that ratio matter? Because it’s used by investors to measure a country’s ability to make future payments on its debt, thus affecting the country borrowing costs. Higher borrowing costs worsen debt further.

A recent British report on global debt lists Bhutan as one “among 14 other countries that are fast heading towards a debt crisis.” The report details hydropower’s rapid loss of economic viability, and concludes: “Should the hydropower sector’s financial performance continue to deteriorate, Bhutan’s solvency could be threatened.”
How convenient will that be for India? And what conditions will it attach to bailouts and pleas for loan forgiveness?
In this day and age, sovereignty and independence are much more likely undermined by economic than political control, albeit in far more subtle and hidden ways. So, the definition of “bullying” these days must go far beyond the old-fashioned geopolitical border disputes, however minor and insignificant, that still make for good press in TV images of jostling Chinese and Indian soldiers.

Time to ask hard questions – that can’t be publicly asked in Bhutan!

It’s time, if not long overdue, to question how benign India’s intentions are in Bhutan. How much “cooperation” is actually “exploitation” and “domination? And, how much of India’s foreign aid to Bhutan (now nearly $US1 billion a year) actually signifies mounting control and interference on one side and growing dependence and erosion of sovereignty on the other?

But of course, with Indian control of Bhutanese expression and politics, those questions will never be asked in Bhutan’s supposed free “democracy”. Just imagine if Bhutan’s daily Kuensel newspaper or its state-run Bhutan Broadcasting Service radio and television dared to publish this article. Unimaginable! How ironic that India, the world’s largest democracy that prides itself on its own free speech, utterly suppresses it in its “friendly neighbour”.
And here’s another question equally impossible to ask: How might it benefit Bhutan to warm up a bit more to China, and even to establish diplomatic relations with its huge northern neighbour, cooperate economically, and welcome selective Chinese aid and investments in Bhutan’s infrastructure?
After all, our connection with China already goes far beyond the political and economic to a deep cultural and spiritual affinity. For example, Bhutan shares directly with China the profound wisdom, texts and traditions of Mahayana Buddhism. China today is experiencing an unprecedented Buddhist revival that creates a natural and intuitive bond with Bhutan.

In fact, Bhutan is already benefitting directly from the resurgence of Buddhism in China. From one end of Bhutan to the other, from the giant Shakyamuni Buddha statue at Kuensel Phodrang in Thimphu to the giant Guru Rinpoche statue at Takila in Lhuentse, monasteries, temples, ceremonies and rituals are maintained, sponsored and supported through Chinese donations and contributions.

For all the fawning gratitude, praise, and adulation Bhutanese officials regularly heap on India for its “special relations” with Bhutan, what word of acknowledgement or appreciation do these officials ever utter for the steady, quiet Chinese support for our precious Bhutanese culture and traditions? Support, incidentally, that comes with “no strings attached” and no crippling debt burden!!

And this shared culture and tradition is a major reason for the surge in Chinese tourists flocking to Bhutan, now greatly outnumbering tourists from any other country. And while the Chinese all pay top dollar on expensive tourist visas to visit Bhutan, thus making China by far the largest contributor to Bhutan’s tourism industry, Indian visitors come for free, requiring no visa of any kind. Sorry to say this, but ask any hotel owner in the country who their least favourite, least respectful and most troublesome guests are, and they unfailingly say “Indians”.

The Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed with India and promised to sign the South Asian Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA). This would open up Bhutan to cars from India, Nepal and Bangladesh; further strengthening India’s hold on Bhutan. Just imagine Bhutan’s roads filled with Indian cars, taxis, buses and trucks. Indian tourists would come in busloads, totally over running Bhutan’s carefully planned ‘quality of quantity’ tourism policy that has helped protect Bhutan. Indian presence would increase, Bhutan’s roads would be destroyed by the increased traffic, resulting in more DANTAK presence to come ‘repair and maintain’ the roads, our pristine environment would be destroyed. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed to sign this agreement, even if the National Assembly of Bhutan has voted against it. Showing how he is willing to do whatever the Indians want.
And despite the absence of diplomatic relations, Bhutan’s commercial relations with China are already quietly flourishing beneath the surface – all the way from yak-herders on Bhutan’s northern borders to Thimphu merchants dependent on Chinese imports, whose quality often far exceeds comparable Indian products.

In short, might Bhutan benefit in more ways than one by slipping away from total domination by one of its neighbours and instead strategically playing off and leveraging China-India competition to its own advantage?
But questions (let alone policies and solutions) like these are an unwritten “no go zone” in Bhutanese politics and media. Indeed, it is a telling mark of the sinister extent and penetration of Indian control and subjugation of Bhutan that no politician or journalist dare touch such questions with a ten-foot pole.

Interestingly, India is unwittingly aided in such suppression of free speech and other human rights by the utter failure of western human rights groups even to notice. Rather the west seems intent on drawing attention to human rights violations in countries like China, which has grown so rapidly into an economic powerhouse that its global reach now threatens western interests. Conveniently for India, it poses no such threat and escapes western scrutiny.

Yes, China may occasionally though very rarely “flex its muscles” in minor border disputes, as India accuses. But compared to Bhutan’s actual ground-level experience and interaction with China, isn’t India’s domination and subjugation of Bhutan far more intrusive, pervasive and insidious, extending into every portion of Bhutan’s social, political and economic fabric?

Are there any Bhutanese out there who dare even to ask?",rorschach34," Lulz, you sure got this from a 'Bhutanese woman'? Looks like shit straight out of a global times editor's pen. Same stereotype journalistic language, same hyping stories, same propoganda that they use everywhere. There are two pictures that the author is trying to paint.

In the first one the author paints the picture how India is a bully to Bhutan and has been hampering its development for years. And also running it into debt. Explains how India is isolating Bhutan and meddling in its affairs. Gives an real life incident of Indians burning a truck and beating the Bhutanese truck driver for being involved in an accident.

In the second picture the author paints how Bhutan is culturally and religiously connected to China. Says tourists from China are the largest in number and **all** hotel managers hate Indian tourists. Chinese imports are of far higher quality than anything form India and trade is between them is 'quietly flourishing underneath the surface'. Ends with human rights abuses of India.

Does the author really think China wants to genuinely help the people of Bhutan?

>Who precisely is bullying Bhutan? And what exactly are Indian troops doing on Bhutanese land in the first place? Just defending poor little Bhutan against big China’s bullying “aggression”? Who, in fact, is more seriously threatening Bhutan’s sovereignty and independence – China or India?

If she knew about the massive geopolitics in play, she would already have answers to these questions. She believes that without any Indian influence/presence in Bhutan, China will also not interfere with it. Just look at Tibet where people have to endure repressive policies. [Human rights in Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Tibet). The moment India is removed from the equation, **China will devour Bhutan.** 

I don't know whether the accusations made is true or false, but the way this whole thing is written makes me question its credibility. This whole picture the post is trying to paint makes it look sketchy. It is a very biased post which makes India look like a bully and China as their savior.  Looks like a Chinese paid propaganda made to look like a genuine post of a concerned Bhutanese citizen.

Bhutan is a puppet state. Their king controls everything and not the people. People have to wear their national clothes and TV was allowed only few years back. Media is tight and is a puppet and even laws are tight and harsh for locals. If you remember in 80's and 90s, they did an ethnic cleansing of their citizens, forcing citizens with background decent of Indians, Bangladeshi and mostly Nepali's out of their country. They haven't changed a bit. I know in early 2000's only govt official and their children's could bear a passport freely. It's like North Korea of the South Asia where not much information goes in, and not much comes out. And where India plays the role of China.

As a person who doesn't own a tv or even watches television, the concept of people actually watching a man in a suit barking with other men for trp is only mesmerizing to me solely because of the question I ask myself: Who the fuck watches this shit? I don't watch this channel but my friend does  . He was watching this Sunday and he was so pumped up and cheering.  So I joined in to see what was going on.  Turns out arnab was having discussion  regarding the dude in kashmir  who was tied to the front of the jeep by indian army jawan.  I don't know on what the other guy said to upset anrab  but dude was shouting and berating the other guy  arnab was like you ""Pakistani  sympathiser  go to Pakistan  "". 
He was shouting at some professor guy too who looked pretty calm to me and wanted to have a discussion but arnab wasn't letting him talk . He said he would join the army if it was possible. 

I watched bits of the programme but man it seems to me that he pays some of those  people a lot of money to come to the programme so he could shout at them and look like a proud nationalist  , the absolute best deshbhakt in front of the people .

* Growth in rural wages has been curtailed. This ensures that the reserve army of the underemployed continues to exert a downward pressure on wages.
* The ruling party’s ideology of religious nationalism has the merit of distracting the attention of the masses waiting impatiently for the fruits of development to trickle down. The hard work put in by the ruling party’s grassroots organizations has done much to steer away the poorer castes and classes from militant demands that interfere with the process of capital accumulation. As the Roman satirist Juvenal said, it is necessary to provide both bread and circuses to the masses.
* The presence of a strong charismatic leader is a big help in developing an anti-liberal mass base and ensuring right-wing policies are implemented. The government has done its best to neutralize the left wing and has placed its nominees in crucial positions in important institutions. Recall that all the East Asian miracle economies had their growth spurts under autocratic governments.

New Delhi: India could face significant short-term economic costs from the ban on large-denomination currency notes, with no significant long-term benefits, economist Paul Krugman warned on Friday.

The 2008 Nobel Prize-winning economist said there is a good case to be made for not having high-value currency notes, but noted that India’s “unusual move” of discontinuing old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was only a one-time effort to flush out hoarded money, and not to eliminate the denominations forever.

“I understand the motivation, but it is a highly disruptive way to do it. I hardly see significant long-run gains, but there certainly are significant, although temporary, costs,” Krugman, a professor at The Graduate Center, City University of New York, said at the Hindustan Times Leadership summit.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 8 November scrapped the high-denomination currency notes in a crackdown on unaccounted wealth, tax evasion, terror finance and counterfeit currency. The move took out 86% of the value of currency in circulation, and economists have warned that it would dent consumer demand in the short term, set back gains to agriculture from a bountiful monsoon and harm productivity.

One of the reasons for Krugman’s disapproval of demonetisation as part of a drive to tackle income tax evasion is his belief that it is practically difficult for developing economies with large unorganized sectors to raise the share of taxes as a proportion of GDP by relying too much on income taxes.

Also read: GST roll-out by September 2017 is a constitutional compulsion, says Arun Jaitley

Although considered regressive, indirect taxes, such as the central excise duty and service tax levied by the central government in India and value added tax (VAT) by states, are more practical tools to raise tax revenue, he said. Indirect taxes are generally considered regressive as they affect the rich and the poor alike, unlike income tax, the burden of which increases progressively on tax payers with high income levels.

India is now leading the discussions among G20 nations for a multilateral framework to prevent income tax evasion, especially corporate tax, based on principles laid down by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of developed economies.

“Trying to have an OECD style income tax system in a country which has a per capita GDP far below OECD levels is not doable,” Krugman said.

The American economist said India could be hit by a recession in China stemming from declining investment, but has no reason to worry about the US turning more protectionist under Donald Trump.

Krugman said it would be difficult for China to sustain investments as a share of GDP and a readjustment can spell trouble for other economies including India.

“China cannot continue its previous investment-driven growth model. How can you manage the large scale of adjustment without a massive recession?. China looks to me ready to blow up,” said Krugman.

He doesn’t see much of an impact on India from the US possibly taking steps to protect its jobs, including from the services sector in India.

“I do not see a short-run macroeconomic crisis (in the US). If anything, policy will shift to fiscal expansion. Extremely unwise long-run policy does not necessarily carry a short-run cost. Economics is not a morality play. You can have bad policies turning out to be catastrophic a generation from now, but that does not necessarily bring a recession now. The US is not going to be a drag on the world economy, but If China blows up, it is going to be a drag on the world economy,” said Krugman.

He added that not being a trade surplus country will work to India’s advantage in this context. The comment comes in the backdrop of US president elect Donald J Trump’s economic policies widely being taken to be protectionist and hence likely to rattle a still recovering global economy.

Krugman said unlike China or Brazil, India will not be at the receiving end of any protectionist measure by the US.

Krugman attributes the current weak global economic growth to a chronic weakness in demand, which was not the outcome of the asset bubble and financial crisis of 2008, but something which ran deeper.

“There is a an underlying inadequacy in spending, which was masked by the asset bubble. The preponderance of evidence now is that this is the new normal that we need to live in a world which does not want to spend enough to keep itself fully employed,” Krugman said. “Unlike earlier thought, high level of public debt due to the economic stimulus that nations doled out in the last few years, now looks misplaced as interest rates are low.”

Krugman also called for a big burst of fiscal expansion in the world economy after which one could think of resetting policies.

Hope they are able to sustain it and bring back some real growth.  I don't know why people downvoted the one comment which commended the RBIs role.
EDIT: And its wholesale index not the consumer price index inflation which has started getting used as the index now, its not as low. 

Yeah, Modiji take credit else these people are going to downvote the hell out of me. Fucking ambani conspiracy to take away key talking points from AAP before delhi elections. Sab mili bhagat hai. Maine logon se pooch liya hai, koi mehengai kam nahi hui... yada yada paid media, when will BJP government punish those who brought tomato prices to 100Rs. Their own MP's are hoarders etc etc.. whitenoise.

 I don't see any sarcastic ""acche din"" comments here. What's with the rIndian *jholawalas*? 4 months, or 122 days, and Modi has beaten back inflation to 2009 levels. Can't they conjure up some devastation or evil in this? In my view, this has little or nothing to do with Modis election to the center. The RBI has managed to keep interest rates high enough for a while now (without succumbing to pressures from the business side; thanks dr Rajan!). Lowered inflation is a natural outcome of current Indian monetary policy. I fail to see the fiscal policies that could have contributed to this. The latest budget does not contain any dramatic shifts in terms of spending or taxation, so I'd be surprised to attribute this outcome to the new government. 

If I'm wrong, I would love to hear why.  modi delivers !

Policy/Economy,"Hi /r/india, I am Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Member of Rajya Sabha and a strong supporter of Net Neutrality, AMA",317,387req,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/387req/hi_rindia_i_am_rajeev_chandrasekhar_member_of/,173,"I am Rajeev Chandrasekhar. I am a second time, independent Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha from Bangalore. In the last 9 years in Parliament, I have taken up issues that range from the welfare of our Veterans and Armed forces, the Economy, Crony capitalists, push for Governance reforms, and also issues like the 2G and other scams.


I have a passion for all things Technology including internet and technology policy, and firmly believe that technology can transform Indian Politics and Governance, our democracy and lives of all citizens. I believe that an enabling internet policy ecosystem, including a neutral internet, is crucial to the success of Digital India.


I have worked as a Chip designer at Intel and worked on the 80486 and Pentium chips, Set up one of the first and largest Greenfield Indian cellular service BPL mobile, and then transitioned into being a technology entrepreneur. As an MP, I was also one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court PIL against the draconian Section 66A of the IT Act, which was struck down earlier this year.


I believe that the current debate on Net Neutrality is a result of the failure of our previous Governments r to initiate a robust multi-stakeholder discussion on Internet Governance  model based structure for Internet Governance. For over three years now, I have argued that we must strive to create a multi-stakeholder based model for Internet Governance,  which would have also resulted in a conclusion and debate of Net neutrality. 

I am doing this AMA to:
1.	Take a stab at addressing specific queries on the nuances of the Net Neutrality debate in India.
2.	Take any inputs from this chat back into Parliament and other interventions I shall be making with the Government on the issue, and
3.	Reinforce my commitment to the Net Neutrality fight and make my pro-neutrality position clear.
Here's a link that will take you to all my articles and interventions on Net Neutrality, including my 30 page submission to TRAI's infamous consultation paper: http://rajeev.in/NetNeutrality.html


I look forward to interacting with the community
",rajeev_mp," Why hasnt India's definition for Broadband increased? USA has it at 25Mbps, pakistan is at 10Mbps.. that is 50 times and 20 times better than us respectively. We are slowest in South Asia.. Why this disparity? 

Cost of the internet plans are like 50% cheaper as well in a country like pakistan.  Thanks all for engaging ! Stay cool but stay engaged on the stuff tht effects you and I! Good evening ! 
 Which are all languages you speak, maga? afaik, there are no privacy laws in India. Why so? Thanks Rajeev for supporting political parties to be under RTI Act. 

http://rajeev.in/pages/RTI.html There have been misleading campaigns made by COAI and Facebook like SabkaInternet hashtag, misscall/sms support. People are thinking Internet for all is same as Neutral Internet. This has resulted in COAI and TRAI claiming they have recieved more support(misscalls,sms) for a non neutral free Internet. I fear the Govt will rule in their favour especially with the lobby culture in all political parties. Your thoughts?

Also, do you think if SabkaInternet and Internet.org comes to fruition, will rural India really get internet connectivity at a faster pace? Internet.org has no plans to improve infrastructure unlike Google's similar initiative. Internet.org just wants to provide a few services for free.
 >I was also one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court PIL against the draconian Section 66A

Cool :) Sir, what do you think about governments assurances on net neutrality? they sound vague at best if you ask me State owned company like BSNL has different internet plans for different states. Why this differentiation within Indians? 

The plans are crazy high taking into consideration that companies like ACT/BEAM offer much better speeds, and at considerably lower prices. Cost of the internet plans are like 50% cheaper as well in a country like pakistan via state owned companies. (PTCL VS BSNL)

Service tax has been increased, but speeds are static. Bad pings and overall very poor customer care via mtnl/bsnl.
Why dont our politicians discuss the sorry state of affairs consumers have to go through, even though they use bsnl/mtnl lines themselves? Hi Rajeev, 
Why do you think we are in this position today where Net Neutrality is a raging debate? Isn’t the need for Net Neutrality self evident? Why are governments the whole world over struggling with this question?
 Do you go through metal detectors at Indian airports? Do you know of MPs (either house) who do not? In general are public representatives treated differently than citizens who hold no power, and do you think that is the correct order of things? My questions to you are aimed at understanding the Net Neutrality view that is building up inside DoT and TRAI: 
 
1. **Are DoT and TRAI going to disallow Zero-Rating or not?** 
 
2. **Why are DoT and TRAI not discussing much better alternatives to zero-rating?** I have listed links to two alternatives below. 
 
3. **Why are OTT players (like Flipkart and Cleartrip) not being invited to DoT panel meetings whereas COAI and Telcos are always present?** Numerous startups which have taken a stand against zero-rating and licensing would be very eager to share their views with the DoT panel. 
 
4. **Is DoT still considering licensing VOIP services like Whatsapp and Skype?** 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
As mentioned in this [TOI article from yesterday](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/DoT-panel-submits-report-on-net-neutrality/articleshow/47500802.cms), DoT is of the opinion: 
 
> essential services such as e-governance, as envisaged in the 'Digital India' plan, should be delivered on a preferential basis to end-users. 
 
Internet.org and Airtel-Zero neither provide e-governance nor the complete internet. **The poor should get an internet which is EQUAL to the rich, not lesser.** Below I have listed links to better alternatives which provide the COMPLETE internet WITHOUT discrimination or restrictions: 
 
1. [Mozilla suggests Net neutral alternatives which provide access to the ENTIRE internet](http://www.medianama.com/2015/05/223-mozillas-mitchell-baker-offers-alternatives-to-zero-rating-for-internet-services/)
 
2. [CEO of Jana.com explains How To Make The Internet Free In Developing Countries WITHOUT zero-rating](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/01/how-to-make-the-internet-truly-free-in-developing-countries/) 
 
 [deleted] BSNL, a state owned company, the primary thing should be to observe global standards and adopt. The private players should not be made to change BSNL/MTNL. it should be other way round. Being left far behind in a field like internet in today's times is just depressing.

The MPs etc should raise the question that why are Indians being made a laughing stock in front of the world for a thing like Internet.. 2005 was when we got broadband, and to be ridiculed by even pakistan is simply disappointing to say the least. What is your view on amount of snooping done by our govts?

what is your view on blatant blocking of websites

Sir how to stop this failtel nexus?

Do you think that india should lead the world and make a strong NN law, for other countries to follow?

thanks for all you did sir, I avidly follow you on twitter Thanks for taking the time to have this interaction. I have a couple of questions
1. So far the Net Neutrality debate involved the existing users of the Internet(apart from TRAI and telecom operators). Even TRAI invited feedback by emails(primarily). Wouldn't this exclude the current non users of the Internet, who might be benefiting from concepts like Zero rating? It is ironic that if there was some zero rating, they could atleast send a mail to TRAI. Telecom operators who provide zero rating may not be speaking for those customers necessarily.            
2. What is the clear line between the public Internet and say an Intranet built on top of the existing Internet. If another company creates a walled garden apart from the telecom operator and gives it for free accessis it more acceptable? Then there would be N Intranets than one  created by any particular company and one can pick and choose theoretically.               
3. So far the debate has been about all packets should be treated equally than similar packets treated equally(QoS field of IP). Is it possible to formalise the technical specification in the NN debate itself(to be implemented by the routers)              
Thanks in advance.  With our Prime Minister being so savvy on the internet, be it on twitter or facebook, why hasn't he taken more of a lead on Net Neutrality or come out more decisively on the issue. Surely he could have been more proactive about this. Do you see NaMo taking a lead on this issue, which is a hot topic the world over? Can it become a plank on which he can build India's space in global politics.  Hi Rajeev sir, thanks for doing this AMA.

1) What is your opinion on internet users being given access to a bunch of government related services for free? For ex - state governments can have bill pay mechanism which can be accessible by any user who has a mobile connection. Do you think this will also seriously go against the concept of net-neutrality?

2) In your opinion, do you think having a free and open internet will help get more people in our country on the internet compared to a service like internet.org or zero-rating? Especially in the case of low income families or individuals.

3) Some countries have made free internet a fundamental right of the citizen. How many years away do you think our country is to reach this? Hi,
Thank you for doing this AMA.

1. What do you think of the move by COAI to solicit support from the general public for their anti-netneutrality activities? They are spamming the public with messages such as "" To support the cause of free internet, give a missed call to 1800-xxx-xxxx"". Is this correct? Isn't it misleading and shouldn't the government take action against such messages?

2. Bsnl also offers data packs which offer only whats app and facebook. If the present government stands for net neutrality then, shouldn't the government ask bsnl(which is in govt's control) to stop offer these? This would be the first step forward.

3. Cellphones being one of India's largest imports, are the steps being taken to start production in India enough? I mean allotment of land and other resource s aside, skill development at the worker level should take place and I do not see much happening in this section. Just wanted your comments.

4. If you had to start BPL today, would it be more or less difficult than the older days?

Thanks! What prompted you to jump from technology to Politics? > I have worked as a Chip designer at Intel and worked on the 80486 and Pentium chips

The first computer I owned was a 80486 :)

16MB RAM
270MB Hard Disk Rajeev: What do you think should be the focus of Modi's Digital India? 

A telecom department panel on net neutrality submitted its report to the communications & IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad over the weekend. Some members of the committee, however, felt that the definition (of net neutrality) should not be at cross-purposes with the government's policy & objectives of Digital India. The upshot is that essential services such as e-governance, as envisaged in the 'Digital India' plan, should be delivered on a preferential basis to end-users. The policy could thus allow for positive discrimination. The report comes at a time the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is busy in the consultation process of defining net neutrality and whether over the top players should be brought under some licensing architecture. Your thoughts on this please! 
 Hi Rajeev, thanks for the AMA. 

A) Could you chat on OROP as its something that you've been vocal on... what do you see as the challenge for the present govt even if they're in agreement on principle? Was it apathy from prior govt. that has delayed this?

B) Do carriers need to raise pricing to achieve profitability needed for network modernization and densification? Are Wi-Fi/small-cell adoption in a broader HetNet in conjunction with macro buildouts needed to solve quality concerns?


 What is bad about getting free access to a website?  Can you explain Net Neutrality in one sentence? AMA verified ✓

**Edit**: AMA is now over, if you guys have any further questions, you can mail Mr. Chandrasekhar at *Rajeev.c [at] nic.in* 1) What is your opinion on the 1st year of the Modi government? Do you think they have set a stage to do something or is it all just marketing as lot of media seem to claim?

2) A lot of metros have been found to have very dangerous Air-quality index levels (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore). Unfortunately, the government has not done enough in this regard. How does the central government prioritize such an issue which needs immediate attention? 

3) What do you think is the biggest problem plaguing india's development at the moment?

Thanks! Dont you think poor will benefit immensely from the internet org? 
Ofcourse facebook will benefit too but hey, benefit of wikipedia to poor is substantial. Its not a zero sum game right?  Namaskar,

What steps are being taken to lower the cost of internet access in India ? Hi Rajeev! Do you have any guidance for a corporate lawyer looking to get into the policy analysis field? Good to see you here and thank god I visited and read what you have to say; it was discovery to know the other you! I had seen your sponsored posts on Facebook and was like - this is some politician in need of publicity!! You know what - I am just amazed that we have this level of engagement with an actual MP. I am even more amazed that we have people like Rajeev in the Parliament in the first place!  Hi Rajeev, my question are not related to Net Neutrality but slightly different which our country is going to fight for it in near future.  

**What your take on legalizing same-sex marriage and cannabis?**

Thanks! Hello, My Questions are:

* Why did you rise suddenly for Net Neutrality ? Where as Internet is already being monopolized by Companies like Airtel in various ways like introducing: FUP and marketing it as an ""Unlimited Plan"" where as it isn't and is misleading consumers in a very bigway ?  

* What about the great Github ban by our government? Github hosts 99% code if 1% of the content is unlikable by Indian Government should it ban the entire domain? In short ban my entire work?

* Why is our Internet so much struggling when Countries like Cambodia are doing better than us? Seems like Corporate companies in India want to become even more rich?

* Why TRAI's policy of 2mbps minimum broadband not given so much importance? If we want good strong net, Policies like these should be enforced much quicker and should be strong enough to bend companies like Airtel to the rule. Why this hasn't been the case, Not even one ""major"" nation-wide company has offered speeds of minimum 2mbps? Especially in High profile places like the capital?

Thank you Dear Sir,  Net neutrality, Bandwidth Throttling, Data Discrimination are a few problems Indian Netizens are facing since a very long time. Why cant TRAI or govt. come up with an independent body to oversee matters like this? [removed] >1. Take a stab at addressing specific queries on the nuances of the Net Neutrality debate in India. 2. Take any inputs from this chat back into Parliament and other interventions I shall be making with the Government on the issue, and 3. Reinforce my commitment to the Net Neutrality fight and make my pro-neutrality position clear.

1) Questions  

* What about keeping the definition of net neutrality as not discriminating between any byte of data?

* Seeing as you are of the opinion that TRAI has not been working well to take and implement the wishes of the consumer and in formulating plans to improve internet framework and architecture, what would it take for the management heads to roll, and getting better people at the helms, Also who has that power?

* Seeing as India is one of the fastest gainers, and with a scope for a very large number of people that will start using the Internet, what according to you can be done to increase speeds, improve ping/reduce latency, jitter, all the while increasing bandwidth to accomodate the newer users and deal with increasing usage (as a result of increased speed & participation)?

2) Inputs

NOTE: I Speak for myself, but I believe others are of similar opinion.

# Actions Speak louder than words. Assuming TRAI and DoT abandon moral stands and go for non-neutral net, what options do we have? How can we try to rectify the situation then, assuming nothing happens in our favor? 

As an aside, have you read Eugeny Morozov? Thanks for doing the AMA. I have an issue which is a huge peeve for me. Why are companies allowed to advertise at a price which doesn't include applicable taxes? Huge hoardings and advertisements which have tiny text underneath that says taxes are extra.

Doesn't that amount to false advertising? The final price I pay is never close to the price advertised. My internet is advertised as Rs 999, but I pay close to 1200, fast food is advertised at Rs. 99 or Rs 35 or 149, but the amount I pay is almost always close to 20% more.

A lot of people are going to find this trivial, but it directly affects a lot of population, especially people who do not have the knowledge.  Would you be willing to submit legislation to change this? How much support do you think an issue like this will get from your colleagues? Honest advertisement is all I'm asking for. What are your views on FUP? Airtel has been using this aggressively and abusing their customers due to lack of competition 
 They give just 10-15GB @2MBPS for 1000-1500pm in Delhi even on wired broadband which should be much cheaper while Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore have much better plans.
Being the capital of India shouldn't Delhi act as a role model for other states rather than having the crap and costliest services. 
Also shouldn't the minimum broadband speeds be increased. US is moving towards gigabits speeds  and we still stuck on 512kbps, its high time for atleast 2mbps. 
Only way to force the isp to give better speed in case of FUP is to increase the minimum speeds.  How do you spend your MPLAD funds? I live in Bangalore and I cry daily at the state of my city. Namaskara swami. How much money do people spend on online campaigning for political parties? Let's say the 2014 elections. Would you know? What is your opinion on the free speech row on IIT-M campus? Hello sir, a few questions:

* What according to you, is a reasonable minimum speed for ""broadband"" and ""3g"" internet?
* What do you think about upgrading our NIB(on a significant scale), to suit the increasing need for bandwidth?
* Classifying Internet as a utility?
* Is there anything the government can do to improve/increase the overseas connections?

Edit: word So what really happened with Idea's acquisition of BPL?  I saw your interview with Newslaundry. I'd just like to commend your effort to communicate with your constituents and your unbiased voicing of the nation's problems in Parliament, something which very few of our MP's would actual go beyond the party line to do. So thank you.  As an independent MP, how do you feel your ability and experience in Parliament differs from that of MPs tied to their parties?
How is the consensus amongst independents? Thanks for doing this. 

Two questions ..

why is the TRAI so lax in implementing and enforcing higher bandwidths. 

Do you this it is regulatory capture?  [deleted] Sir what is your daily routine? Daily activities? Do you also work like us 09-05? Recently I've noticed that service provider (mostly Airtel) has various sort of recharge voucher or coupons available for internet ranging from 5 to 50 as a night pack. They are providing 1gb 3G data at the price of 49 from night 12 to morning 6. 

Q.1. Would this be in contravention of net neutrality? 

Q.2. Considering they can afford to give out data at such minimal rates won't they attract the provision of competition law for unfair practices? 

Q.3. Who's the authority to determine tariffs? At least if not a flat tariff, there should be a guidance to keep a check on prices from consumer perspective, mustn't trai mandate that minimum of this amount of data should cost more than this?  1. I haven't yet understood why Internet.org would be so bad, or how that hurts any other part of the Intenet. To me the arguments against it is a bit like the argument that gay marriage will harm all marriage. 

2. Similarly, if an e-commerce site offered to pay a customer's Internet bill for shopping on that site, how is that different from zero rating? Why do you think a country like India needs to worry about fancy word ideals like ""net neutrality"". 

When a tiny percentage of population has access to internet, isn't internet.org a GOOD idea to bring more people online ? The perfect solution would be if there are other ways of making internet (or even a part of internet) free - but that is not going to happen.

Your position is more like ""I want everyone to have the costly multi-course meal like me, or nothing ! - not even the pav bhaaji offered by someone for free"".",2015-06-02 21:32:24
Policy/Economy,ACCOUNTABILITY: This is what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy and our Brown Lords.,88,69jpql,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/69jpql/accountability_this_is_what_is_wrong_with_indian/,29,"If you are an Indian, it would be an astronomically impossible odd that you didn’t hear of how corrupt our bureaucracy is or how some **‘babu‘** or some **‘bade sahab‘** is corrupt and nothing more than a public disgrace. **That’s Indian bureaucracy for you.**

The real problem with bureaucrats is not just about caste and reservation. It is about accountability and responsibility. The pay structure of our Bureaucracy is such that officers get little salaries and large perks and amenities in form of bungalows and servants. In many cases, they occupy the same bungalows that the British left in 1947. And they do not do their job responsibly.

Fair disclosure that *I do understand and acknowledge the fact not all bureaucrats are corrupt. In fact, we have exemplary civil servants that have served as an inspiration to us all.* But this post is not about them, those honest civil servants. This is about what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy. The problem is not about the political issue or power struggles, but about an entire class of bureaucrats who are egoistic, arrogant, inhumane, corrupt and muddled with skulduggery.

**Bureaucrats, Bureaucracy, and Bureaucratic Measures** are now modern day derogatory overtones that express tyranny, arrogance and debilitation in our country’s governance. Bureaucrats are, in this day and age, perceived as those with massive egos and false nationalist zealotry. They are in essence a rule-bound bookkeepers who have ‘I’ mentality when it comes to interpreting rules. They play favorites, they are biased, they stay vague so that they are not held accountable, and they maintain chaos so that no one can see them cheat.

**From Outside: Looking In**

Don’t take my word for it. *I am just an ordinary Indian citizen exercising my freedom of speech.* Wouldn’t it help if you could see our Indian bureaucracy from an outside view? It is said that an unbiased opinion comes from the uninvolved. So let’s do that. Let’s see what others think of Indian bureaucracy.

In October 2010, just after the conclusion of Commonwealth Games in India, Eric Ellis wrote a post titled ‘A most uncivil service‘ on The Age where he talks about the Indian bureaucracy. Unfortunately, he has nothing good to say. He writes the following –

>""The Delhi games showed the world just what can be done when it's daunting civil service takes control – and the result wasn’t pretty. Corruption, waste, inefficiency, obfuscation and a cancerous lack of accountability in officialdom – and all of it on an Olympian scale.

>Delhi’s dramas may have been revealing for observers who briefly touch India but sadly these are the common issues daily confronting and long bedeviling a billion Indians and the foreign investors urged to invest their money in business there. Some economists have calculated that India’s bureaucratic inefficiency costs the country 1 to 2 points in annual growth.

>India’s daunting civil service is supposed to be the pride of the nation – just ask its privileged nabobs – but instead its malfunction and misgovernance hold India back. Enter any average government office in India and one is struck by the mountains of yellowing paperwork, years of filing and unfinished work ground down by the sheer scale of chaotic India’s myriad issues that overwhelm.""


Another account by Lant Pritchett of Harvard University sheds some brighter light on the Indian bureaucratic problem. In a paper, in 2009, titled “Is India a Failing State?“, he described Indian bureaucracy to be one of the most serious problems in the world today; up there with AIDS and climate change. He makes a point that foreign investments, and any welfare schemes in India for that matter, will never improve India’s economy as long as there is an inefficient Indian bureaucracy. These bureaucrats are like a tumorous growth that eat away any welfare funds like a parasite.

In his book “The Foundation Pillars for Change: Our Nation, Our Democracy & Our Future”, **Mr. V.K. Patel** writes that *most developmental spending fails to reach its intended recipients. It is either diverted or misused by a sizeable and a complacent bureaucracy.* I corroborate to Mr. Patel’s description of bureaucracy.

*We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds. Unless and until such an overhaul happens, India is not going to be a great country. No welfare policies will ever come to fruition. India cannot change without a change in our bureaucratic system. This is what is wrong with the Indian bureaucracy.*",therollingindian," While a corrupt bureaucracy is obviously a concern,

> We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds.

These words sound like the rallying call of a communist revolutionary rather than a solution.

How about borrowing concepts from the private sector, like:

1. Project-level ownership and accountability - Transfers every 2-3 years just dilutes responsibility. We need to assign an officer to a project - who is responsible for its success and failure. Officers are rewarded on the basis of their success in projects. They also need to be enabled to have complete power over execution of a project.

2. Peer feedback system - Something like Google's PageRank. Every officer can give anonymous feedback/rating to every other officer. The weight each officer's ratings have on the person being rated depend on the rating officer's ratings. So if an employee rated 4.5 stars rates another employee 3 stars, it carries more mathematical weight than a 2-star employee handing out a 5-star rating. Another system for citizens to rate the officers could also be introduced. Transparently declare these ratings on a website, and using these as a basis for promotions.

3. Lateral hiring - plenty of 40-something execs in private industry have earned all they need and have excellent intelligence and execution skills. They'd be happy to contribute to the society by the way of participating in government projects, which have enough scale and complexity to be considered challenging and interesting.

4. Reduce fixed components of salary and have greater performance-linked components. These could be linked to a project's execution score - the number of parameters on which a completed project meets or exceeds its objectives, and the peer feedback system. I am pretty sure if we have mathematicians/game theoreticians design such ratings-incentives systems we can form them in a manner that encourages performance and minimizes abuse.

5. Consider hiring government officers a liability. We're already doing things in this direction. Outsource everything you can, especially menial tasks like facilities management, payroll management, peons, security for non-critical infrastructure etc. Privatize all PSUs. The common argument for PSUs is that you need them for projects that cost more than the value they provide, but need to be provided in any way. In such cases, just award a Viability Gap Funding to private companies undertaking such projects.

6. Empower lokpal/vigilance divisions - It is that simple, really. All we need to reduce corruption is will at the top. The only reason a lot of these agencies are toothless is because everyone from the MLAs to the CMs depends on the corruption ecosystem to fill their pockets, fund their elections, run their corrupt businesses and keep them in power. 

(You need to look at MNCs and see how they outsource stuff - security, facilities management, HR, event planning, payroll - everything is handled by third parties. Only execs, engineers, designers, PMs etc. are recruited directly by them) >We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds.

before doing all this just try taking away their NFU and see the fun. you sound a little like a disgruntled retired bank clerk Sharma ji sitting on the housing society bench at 6pm eating peanuts and holding court...  A post about accountability, and no mention of transparency.

To fix the entire system, from chaprasi to head babu, put an ERP system for filework in place. Every person has to check in and check out files. All modifications, permissions, rejections, fines, awards, everything gets logged.

That's it. Give a public UI for this system and watch things change. Total Number of IAS officers in India : [4,296](http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=160629) (against authorized strength of 6,396 ~ 23% vacant).

In 2016, according to the Department of Personnel Training (DoPT).

Group A  - 76,066

Group B - 224,337

Group C (excluding safai karmacharis) -   2,851,905

Group C (safai karmacharis) - 47,631


[Source](http://dopt.gov.in/sites/default/files/AnnualReport_2016-17_ENG.pdf)  Accountability needs taking responsibility for one's actions. Indian mentality is all about being ruled by circumstances, and therefore feeling extremely personally attacked for any accountability.

People even feel so bad about holding people accountable. If there is any possibility of negative reaction from authority, the idea is often kyon life kharab karna kisiki hai lena. In addition these days there always is the fear of people having political connects and coming after you.

Accountability word humare cultural dictionary me nahin hai  Honestly, I feel , if all these projects were logged on some website, and there was some field showing what are the blockers for said project, I feel this shit would be solved.... But there is no way we could get our politicos to agree to that, or actually get that working properly. (No one would update it, and it'd die a sad terrible death...) IAS officers are a small subset of the Beauracracy. The inefficiency and corruption you speak of is largely done by the lower level officers and politicians. Instead of taking away their small perks, we should be giving them better salaries. This ""aam aadmi's""  idea that everyone in the govt should be working for peanuts is cancerous.

**India’s imminent economic crisis** 

 ______ 
To foster higher growth, authorities need to focus on productivity enhancing structural reforms that would encourage the private sector to invest in India. Photo: Mint

Poor macroeconomic management, both by the central bank and political regimes over the past several years, is leading India toward an imminent vicious cycle of low growth and high inflation, making it exceedingly vulnerable to emerging domestic and geopolitical risks. The low growth-high inflation scenario will lead to higher fiscal and current account deficits, consequent capital outflows, a weaker currency and a lack of confidence in the economy among investors. The authorities need to undertake meaningful structural reforms and loosen monetary and exchange rate policy at the earliest to arrest the decline before it culminates in an external and financial crisis. A loose fiscal policy (increased government expenditure) at this juncture with a likely low fiscal multiplier would be counterproductive and accelerate the pace of economic decline.

Economic growth in India has likely been lower than the 7% rate that has been estimated by the Central Statistical Authority for the past two-three years. A sustained 7% gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been inconsistent with other major indicators, including credit, investment, index of industrial production, and exports growth slowing for at least the past four years. A slower 5.7% official GDP growth in 2QFY18 is therefore not surprising. In fact, before the switch to a new series of GDP numbers in early 2015, GDP growth estimates were 4.7% for FY14, according to the old series. New methodology introduced in the new series raised them to 6.7% for FY14, inconsistent with other indicators. Amongst other flaws, value added in manufacturing, which has been consistently significantly higher than other indicators would suggest, is arrived at from a corporate financial database maintained by the ministry of corporate affairs. It would be impossible to arrive at a true measure of value added in manufacturing from financial accounting data for even a few large firms such as Reliance, especially in an era where production of goods and services is becoming increasingly integrated.

Economic output and growth depend mainly on productivity growth and on increases in labour and capital; most commentators mistakenly tend to focus instead on the uses of this output—consumption, investment and exports. Productivity growth, the main driver of growth, depends on structural reforms that would require better institutions and improving human skills.

Structural reforms are reforms aimed at changing the structure of the economy to make it more market-oriented, and consequently efficient and productive. India needs to focus on reforms in several areas—liberalizing markets, legal, civil service, tax structure, financial sector, education, and labour, amongst others. In competitive markets, any price different from the market-determined one (e.g. controls such as minimum or maximum prices) leads to a decline in output, ensuring reduced GDP.

To foster higher economic growth and job creation, the authorities need to focus on productivity enhancing structural reforms that would encourage the private sector—domestic and foreign—to invest in India. Specifically, the innumerable controls on markets and administered prices need to be freed up, including food and agricultural prices, water, electricity, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, seeds and railways, amongst others that reduce output and lead to a misallocation of resources. The direct tax structure needs to be simple and transparent with retrospective taxes eliminated. Public sector banks need to be recapitalized and privatized. The education system needs to be opened up to investors—domestic and foreign—as a profit-making sector, both at the school and higher education levels. These are minimal measures to attract investments.

The inexplicably tight monetary policy of high interest rates and overvalued exchange rate have been damaging to the economy. The insistence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to engage in foreign exchange market intervention to maintain an overvalued currency has encouraged further volatile debt inflows. This has increased India’s external vulnerability and inhibited financial markets development.

Overall, RBI’s high interest rate and overvalued exchange rate policy has hurt credit growth, especially to industry, hurt firm-level debt sustainability and in turn bank balance sheets, and damaged exports and domestic industry further via cheaper imports. India is the only major economy in Asia with a negative credit gap (deviation from trend), according to the International Monetary Fund.

Fiscal policy has largely been unimaginative and a tighter fiscal policy with tight monetary policy has meant no policy support for growth over the past several years. Tax policy has mainly been one of raising tax rates—excise duties on petrol and diesel mainly and service tax rates that have increased from 12% to 18% over the last three years. At the same time, little effort has been made to simplify tax rules; indeed, the new goods and services tax structure with multiple rates is the most complicated globally. This structure with a smattering of controls has kept money out of India.

The fiscal multiplier is low; around 0.3 for emerging economies, according to some estimates. This means an increased fiscal expenditure of Rs40,000 crore (0.3% of GDP) being mentioned in the press would yield a negligible additional growth of 0.1% to GDP, raising growth from 5.7% to 5.8%.

The costs of this misguided fiscal expansion (government expenditure) could be significantly high. It would not lead to sustainable growth or increased investments from the private sector. The larger fiscal deficit, along with slowing growth reducing tax revenue, and a consequent worsening fiscal situation would lead to more borrowing from the RBI. At the same time, the deteriorating economic situation would lead to capital outflows, slowing the economy further, draining liquidity from the system and raising interest rates, further dampening economic growth.

To conclude, the government needs to undertake structural reforms on a war-footing to encourage investments to grow the economy and increase revenue growth. Interest rates need to be reduced by the RBI. Misadventures such as expansionary fiscal policy will not be sustainable and will lead to low growth, higher fiscal deficit, high inflation, less competitiveness that would trigger capital outflows and lead to an external and also a financial crisis if financial sector weaknesses are not addressed.

I think one of the big reasons is that the Chinese government has an almost totalitarian grip over the country.

What this means is, for example if they are making a bridge and they need permission from some people to raze their houses to make way, the government decides how much they will be compensated, when they have to vacate and if the homeowner goes against that, he is thrown in jail.

Thus a lot of daily hurdles that the Indian government has, the Chinese don't.

Looking so far back as the British is of no use. In 1960 India was doing better than China on all parameters. Technological dominance came later.

**Moving towards an investment revival** 

 ______ 
Is corporate investment finally stirring to life? There are now a few silver
linings in what continues to be a dark sky. These rays of hope deserve more
attention than they are getting right now.

In its latest monetary policy statement released in early February, the
monetary policy committee of the Indian central bank said, as part of its
comments on the outlook for the Indian economy, that there are early signs of
“a revival in investment activity”. The panel that sets interest rates
believes the revival in global demand should help strengthen domestic
investment. Earlier, the World Bank had said in its June update on the global
economy that gross domestic capital formation—or investment—would overtake
private consumer spending in fiscal year 2019 as the main driver of Indian
economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also been expecting
a private sector investment recovery in the next fiscal year.

Much of this seems to fly in the face of an overwhelming fact: Indian industry
is still struggling with the problem of overcapacity. The production
facilities frenetically built during the previous economic boom have run into
the problem of weak domestic demand. However, the first synchronized recovery
in the global economy since the financial crisis could provide the export
demand needed for Indian companies struggling with excess capacity.

The industrial outlook surveys conducted every quarter by the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) continue to show capacity utilization at a little over 70%. This
number needs to increase by at least 10 percentage points before companies get
back into investment mode. It is also widely known that the twin balance sheet
problem, or the mirror images of excess corporate leverage and a mountain of
soured bank loans, is a huge obstacle for private investment. Companies are
more focused on using cash flows from operations as well as asset sales to
reduce debt rather than invest in new capacity.

However, the global data is more reassuring. Many large economies have seen a
strong revival in corporate investment over the past few months, and it would
be unusual if Indian corporate investment did not pick up, though a lot
depends on what happens to the structural overcapacity in China as a result of
its investment bubble. The big policy gamble taken by the Donald Trump
administration in the US—of a large fiscal stimulus despite tight labour
markets—could blow another global bubble unless monetary policy is tightened
rapidly. But for now it will fuel strong global demand.

Much of the early data in India suggests that the game right now is capacity
expansion rather than building new facilities. The Mark To Market column
published in this newspaper cited the order trends in capital goods companies
such as ABB India, Siemens and Thermax to argue that brownfield investments
are seeing a recovery. There is less action as far as greenfield investments
go. The index of industrial production also suggests that capital goods
production is growing at a healthy clip, though it must be reiterated that
this segment of the factory output data is notoriously volatile.

There is widespread agreement that India cannot have sustainable growth
acceleration unless private sector investment picks up. The economy has till
recently been very heavily dependent on consumer spending plus public
investment by the government. The two other drivers of aggregate
demand—corporate investment and exports—have struggled. It is for this reason
that the recent green shoots are important.

A bit of recent economic history would help clarify why a recovery in private
sector investment matters for India. The two important economic booms in the
26 years since the 1991 economic reforms tell us an important story. Be it the
1994-97 acceleration or the one between 2004-08, it is clear that a
combination of a strong global economy plus a private sector investment boom
is needed to lift the underlying trend economic growth on a sustainable basis.
Consumer spending and government expenditure alone can take economic growth so
far—but no further.

Strong export growth to complement the recovery in domestic demand could help
companies deal with excess capacity. The deleveraging of corporate balance
sheets as well as the recapitalization of public sector banks can create space
for the financing of new industrial capacity. The battle against the
investment slump is far from over—but there is now reason to hope that the
worst is over.

**A credibility deficit in statistics** 

 ______ 
The Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) on 29 May. This is the first estimate for a full year after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) took over. The growth rate of GDP at 7.3% at constant prices is not only better than the last year of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) but also makes India the fastest growing economy in the world. At a time when the world economy is showing signs of slowing, the performance of the Indian economy judged by these numbers should be cause for cheer. The fact that India’s economy grew faster than China’s may give the impression that all is well, despite fears of rural distress across India.

Unfortunately, nobody seems to be happy with these numbers. Not only has the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the red flag doubting these numbers in its policy review, even the finance ministry has advised caution while interpreting these numbers. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided to send a team to understand the new GDP numbers put up by the CSO. Even the financial media, which should have lapped up these numbers, has shown maturity while reporting them.

India’s statistical agency is well-regarded not only in India but also internationally, but the new GDP numbers pose a serious challenge to its credibility. While the CSO did bring out an explanatory fact sheet, thus far, its attempts to explain these numbers have not worked—partly because the explanations have been largely in terms of accounting and the arithmetic of national accounting, with very little clarity on the nature of changes and the sources of divergence between the new series and the old series.

It is not the arithmetic that is being questioned; the very basis of growth that seems to be at variance with the optimistic picture being presented by the national accounts. The high growth rate of GDP is attributed largely to the better-than-average performance of services and manufacturing with agriculture, mining and construction showing deceleration. The growth rate of manufacturing at 7.1% is not only at variance with the growth rate of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) at 2.3% but is also at variance with the reported sales of automobiles, tractors and many other manufactured goods, all of which show deceleration in sales and production. For the record, sales of commercial vehicles last year declined by 2.8%.

Even for the services sector, the growth rates appear far too optimistic. Profits of companies do not reflect this optimism; nor do sales figures, which are subdued compared with the numbers reported in the national accounts estimates. Other data, such as exports and investment data, are also at variance with the rosy picture presented by the CSO. Clearly, there is something missing as far as the GDP numbers are concerned. Quite simply, the whole is not the sum of parts as expected in an accounting sense.

One of the reasons offered by the CSO for the variance has been the change in methodology of arriving at these numbers. To keep up with international practices, the CSO changed the methodology of computing GDP and its aggregates. As a result, the manufacturing growth rate, which was earlier based on the IIP and the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) data on volume and value-added growth, now also takes into account the advance tax filing data maintained by the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA). This practice of using tax data extends to the services sector as well, unlike the earlier series which used volume-based indices.

While the new series may be consistent with the best practices adopted internationally, doubts remain. These are not only related to the conceptual framework for measuring growth in sectors and sub-sectors of the economy but also to the coverage of the MCA database. This is particularly a problem of developing countries, where the informal/unorganized sector still constitutes a large part of the economy. Serious questions have also been raised by Prof. R. Nagaraj—a member of the committee which recommended the use of MCA data—not only on the completeness of the data but also the methodology adopted to blow up the estimates.

It is obvious that the new series raises far too many questions than it has answered so far. A reasonable approach to such drastic changes would have included a wider discussion among the academic community as well as media dissemination before the new series was adopted. By maintaining secrecy on these, the CSO has not only messed up its communication strategy but also done considerable damage to its credibility.

The matter is not only about statistical methods and estimates. The issue of national accounts is also fundamental to the understanding of what is happening to different sectors of the economy and the way different sectors respond to various policy measures. A discredited database not only does injustice to the statistical system of the country but also hinders policy response needed for long term growth by giving mixed signals.

Article was posted in 2015 when the questions surrounding the new GDP 2011-12 series had been released. 

The main criticisms were that Index of Industrial Production (IIP) growth data was at odds with manufacturing growth in the 2011-12 series. The new IIP 2011-12 series released seems to reconcile these numbers and hence an upward revision. 

Second, there has been no back series of GDP or GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) released based on 2011-12 prices. So essentially, we have estimates 2011-12 onwards and we have earlier estimates based on 2004-05 prices. We cannot directly compare these numbers as it's simply not a base shift, it is a shift in methodology. ",2017-06-04 05:27:32
Policy/Economy,"[P] Rajnath Singh on Twitter: ""One can have differences over Nehruji's policies but his integrity, his contribution and his love for the country was unquestionable.""",64,2m9pwm,http://twitter.com/BJPRajnathSingh/status/533159806802993152,26,,theguywhoknewtoomuch," Totally agree.  Which is fucking true.
 This is called a platitude His policies are the reason we are not as fucked up as Pakistan today.

But I guess a few years of the Hindutva brigade in power will correct that. Shit like this is why Rajnath Singh is sidelined in Modi ji's cabinet. 

/s Nonsense. Look at what he did with Kashmir and the China war. Love for the nation my foot ! Too bad his love for his children and dynastic politics exceeded his love of the country. A notch or more below [Advani's 'Jinnah was secular'?](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4616445.stm) His love for the country is irrelevant.  His 'policies' were so bad he's lucky to have gotten away without having to face trial for criminal negligence and dereliction of duty.  

This is like saying Hosni Mubarak's love for his country was unquestionable.  Unfortunately for him, the Egyptians were smarter than us and threw him in jail before he ended up on postage stamps and school textbooks.  Or for that matter, the Nazis, there is no questioning their love for their Fatherland, it is just their policies that were bad.  duh. Yup his contribution in solving Kashmir Dispute and giving us a nice 4 decade long dynasty rule is unquestionable.",2014-11-14 16:49:08
Policy/Economy,[NP] Rant against GST!,25,6xsjmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6xsjmc/np_rant_against_gst/,21,"Hello fellow randians! 

This might be a long rant but I think it might be affecting a lot of us here. Earlier, i.e. pre GST most restaurants and online food ordering places had their menus adjusted to whatever taxes they paid earlier and had figures like 199/299/500 etc. inclusive of all taxes. The breakup between the service and the tax used to be shown in the bill and didn't matter much as the bill was what I knew I was paying. 

Now in comes GST! The grand scheme supposed to propel the Indian economy to nobody knows what heights. :| 

Most restaurants and online places here in Bangalore just shamelessly add GST to the final bill and the justification is that it's mandatory. Now, I know it's mandatory for them, but what about the food prices? Practically none have adjusted their prices to take out the tax component that used to be added before. Case in point here is freshmenu. Great food, great service everything but then this. Had been noticing this since some time but just can't keep it in anymore.

Not just food, malls etc. now show the price without the GST so you're in for a rude shock when the cashier tells you the final amount. Didn't used to be the same amount earlier either but now it's way more than what you'd have thought.

I used to admire the current government a lot. Liked the statesman Modi used to appear. Still respect him for the foreign policy that seems to be going in the right direction. But at the end of the day/month I do have to take a look at my wallet. And frankly, I've been let down. Can't be too enthusiastic about a government that's continually taking steps to rip me of my money. I pay all my taxes regularly and do so happily, knowing that it'll be used for the nation, but to what extent do I keep paying up? 

The previous government used to be in news for various scams and the level of corruption used to be mind-boggling. But sorry to say, it never directly affected me or most of my acquaintances. I'm in no way justifying them, but at least they let the middle class grow independently. This government seems to be hell bent on killing it. And it's all done legally, so no one can really say anything. 

I'll go on a limb to say that the middle class consumption was driving the economic growth in this country since the last 15 years and with the measures that the govt is taking they're sure to kill it by making the middle class more conservative with their spending. And honestly, I'm actually wishing that it goes out next election. Well aware there's no other option we can actually vote for, but so so hoping that one comes up.

End of rant. Sorry. Bye! ",_Overly_Optimistic," OP, are you saying that FreshMenu, who used to sell a dish for like Rs.599, inclusive of all taxes, pre GST and is now selling for Rs.599+GST?  Dont say sorry at end. You are damn fucking right. Especially last two paragraphs.  As far as I remember, food menu prices were always exclusive of taxes in Delhi/North India. 

I am surprised that it is new for you to pay tax over prices mentioned in menu. Welcome to new normal.  > Most restaurants and online places here in Bangalore just shamelessly add GST to the final bill and the justification is that it's mandatory. Now, I know it's mandatory for them, but what about the food prices? Practically none have adjusted their prices to take out the tax component that used to be added before. Case in point here is freshmenu. Great food, great service everything but then this. Had been noticing this since some time but just can't keep it in anymore.

Can't blame the government for people's greed. Prices have reduced in some places, increased in others as far as restaurants are concerned here in non-metro city. I am happy I can now enjoy full meals at under 200 a-la-carte if I look hard enough. It was impossible before GST. would you re consider voting for BJP if fresh menu lowered its prices? 
also can you list out which items you buy specifically which are priced high now? Damn right, GST is just another way for the government to make more money. It all goes into the minister's pockets. ",2017-09-03 18:58:41

I will add more. 

Some users pointed that there is no good journalism. But that's not right. There is a good journalism but we have to find it. I am creating these lists to help ourselves. As a conscious and educated citizens we have to be careful as much as we can. Sometime you can find a good article in the bad list and a poor article in the good list. Above lists are not strictly implying but providing a general idea for us to be careful. 
 ",Arjun_," So basically /r/india homepage should be avoided? /r/india I believe that if you're looking for a news source that's 100% unbiased, you won't find them. As well informed citizens and well adjusted people, the best we can do is read multiple sources of information and decide for ourselves where we stand on various political, social and economic issues...

I read both Kafila and Swarajya Mag. I form my own opinions and do not blindly take sides in politics. That's all.

Still, if I were you, I'd avoid all those new generation ""content creating"" websites that exist just to get more clicks and make profits from ad revenue. Examples would be: ScoopWhoop, DailyYo, Scroll, MensXP etc. tl;dr dont read anything Livemint is good journalism.  Should-read would make a shorter list.
Economic times is TOI minus the tabloid stuff.Washington post is a source I have always found to be balanced.For cultural perspective read the Hindu.Ignore it for economic stuff.Asia Pacific for defence and geopolitics. BC India ki toh koi site bachi hi nahin ab. All the sites that I know are there. The New York Times is good journalism? Kaunsi duniya mein bhaiyya? Their stories about India are generally trashy and look more like hit pieces than anything else. 

Also, as a ""right-aligned"" person, I find the Caravan excellent; their long-form pieces are pretty good. The Hindu, for all its left alignment, goes to great lengths to keep news and opinion separate. And their science and technology reporting is the best out there. For regular news too, your usual suspects (The Hindu, ToI, IE, HT, ET, NDTV, IBNLive) are fairly okay.

Among the newer publications, I quite enjoy reading Swarajya. They often publish articles by experts in various fields (Bibek Debroy, Syed Ata Hasnain, etc.) and other folks who either have several years of experience working in the fields they write about. Many of them wouldn't have found a voice in the regular mainstream media. The editing leaves much to be desired, but the content is quite alright. [deleted] well that's a huge fucking list. what are we supposed to read then? Add DNA India, The Logical Indian, Mili Gazette, Mid-day, The Statesman, Hindustan Times, New Indian Express, Daliyo, Story Pick to your list.

Edit: Outlook India and The Week Firstpost is the bane of existence. Everything from their news piece to movie reviews and political op-eds are based on sensationalism, so much so that sometimes they put TOI to shame. They are the self-proclaimed thought-leaders of new-age media, but with horrible taste for news. I especially hate their movie reviews; every snobbish mofo there is a wannabe Roger Ebert, with all talk but no substance. I don't know why people even read their stuff anymore.

Their general negativity was so repulsive that I unliked them from my fb to avoid their hateful feeds. There is no Good journalism. 

NYT is biased, India isn't its target yet. Guardian is relatively better but some of its guest editorials are down right moronic. 

Economist has a massive Anti-China bias, otherwise it has good content but one must never take it for good journalism.  
Same with TheDiplomat, massive anti-China bias.  

For domestic Chinese paper/mag, Caixin is best. I recommend reading http://www.thebetterindia.com and http://thealternative.in - Really good stories put out regularly. Add [project syndicate](http://www.project-syndicate.org/) too. You get great articles from highly qualified authors ranging from Jeffery Sachs, yanis varoufakis & Raghuram Rajan to Sashi Tharoor. There are rarely very long articles, but since most of the articles are by people who are some of the best in their respective fields, the quality is really good. wire scroll n fristpost Scroll.in, janatakareporter, firstpost, thewire.in, catch  Depends.

StartUp Beat Shanknaad pages and stories.  NitiCentral, OpIndia, TruthOfGujarat, CounterCurrents, indiasamvad.co.in, indiafacts.co.in  How is Indian express? The Telegraph is right wing, The Sun is a tabloid. Avoid anything from Rupert Murdoch. 

I read The Guardian but avoid their OP-ed posts. Oh I forgot Private Eye Magazine! They're consistently good & funny.

For Indian news, newslaundry seems alright so far.  [deleted] TOI website is actually quite good just they churn sheer numbers of news reports everyday some of them turn out to be shit but all in all they're quite neutral and good news source also add NYT and BBC in it because their India related news stories are heavily biased.

Edit - Dude NYT is not a good news source its the same paper which run the bullshit [Iraq has WMD stories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Miller) and in words of Noam Chomsky [NYT is pure propaganda](http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/noam_chomsky_the_new_york_times_is_pure_proganda_partner/). I like how entire publications can be written off by one user on an anonymous forum just saying two words. great work randia. truly

fwiw i agree with most of the OP's edited list I understand if a newspaper is biased towards a political idealogy that it manipulates news, then it should be considered bad source. 

But if the articles are well researched, should the alignment matter ?

Also few more to add to good reads list.

 * Newyorker (well researched long form articles)
 * The Atlantic (Entertaining, lacks substance, but good opinion pieces)
 * Granta (Good long form articles)

 I don't think any Indian newspaper left here which is considered good in randia. Reuters is a good source I like business standard.

I always found their news coverage to be adequate and relevant. Being a business newspaper, its coverage on personal finance, investing and observation of broad trends is good. Ignoring ultra biased Mihir Sharma, coverage of political news is minimal and mostly well grounded. Weekend issue has good lifestyle articles. You should certainly give it a chance. read the telegraph. really good paper, imo

for tech : android police is good, anandtech is good I would like to recommend Mint, Medianama and SpicyIP as sites that must be read. Also techcrunch? Seriously? I would recommend Recode and Anandtech instead. Also, could we please reclassify Newslaundry as media criticism + opinions instead of news?

Now coming to the political bias in the media mentioned in the first section. That is fine by me. I read them with the realization that they are biased just to get the view from the other side on several issue. I don't need to agree with ""them"" (the definition of them changes from topic to topic) or fight them; I just need to know how the other side thinks and feels about an issue. So do not restrict reading based on political biases. Bad clickbaity content  however should be avoided at all costs! That said, calling Buzzfeed clickbait becomes tricky as the news section has some good articles. http://www.buzzfeed.com/news You can say that Buzzfeed India is a bit clickbaity and they are unabashedly so.

PS: NDTV and IBN are yellow journalism? Do you even know what yellow journalism means? :D [deleted] Instead of targetting the negatives, can we have a list of good websites and blogs that do their niche thing or general thing (like news) While we're at it, can you guys tell me how do you prefer to read news on your smartphone? Used to read The Statesman when I was young. It was a great newspaper.

Surprised to see Caravan in the list of bad publications. It is easily the best article source I've ever read in India. It's features on Air India's destruction by Praful Patel, articles on the likes of Arvind Kejriwal, Arindam Chaudhary and Subramanium Swami were great.

The single greatest takedown of anyone I've read from an Indian source is this Caravan article on Suhel Seth.

http://www.caravanmagazine.in/books/age-seth Business Standard is a pretty good newspaper for financial news. Always found the articles well written; esp the opion pages.  India TV.  Good effort. Although it's usually a bad idea to eliminate major news sources. Know what their biases are and read different perspectives within reason. But obviously propaganda sources, govt mouth-pieces, tabloids, one-off blogs and social networks are really sketchy.

Good sources: 

International magazines/webzines: Economist (generally centrist, slightly right-wing economically) - it's not just a business magazine at least 50% is dedicated to international politics, Time (center-left), Salon (bit leftist).

BBC and Al-Jazeera get a lot of flak around here (""anti-india bias) but I've found most of their content excellent. Their documentaries are outstanding.

Vice (bit leftist) is a good documentary channel with a lot of current affairs.

Democracy Now is a good daily news broadcast, but sometimes a bit too leftist and conspiratorial.

John Oliver and Real Time with Bill Maher are good for US+intl politics, but remember they are comedy/satire shows. They're both pro-democrat.

From your current list, +1 for council for foreign relations and the diplomat. NYT, Atlantic are both great. Guardian is good, but some of their opinion pieces are occasionally absurdly left and sometimes borderline insane SJW territory.

Livemint is quite good (indian source, business news tilt). The Hindu, New Indian Express and The Telegraph are good newspapers with frequently excellent opinion pieces by guest authors.

I see a lot of people trashing Firstpost and scroll.in as being leftist. Like DailyO, these are a lot like blog aggregators, and it really depends on who is the author of the post you're looking at.

Sources to generally avoid:

 Most tabloids and almost everything with a conspiritard lean (ranging from globalresearch on the left to mediacrooks in india on the right). I'm not a fan of India today, in a lot of ways they try to sensationalize news and cater to what people want to hear. Times Now newshour is similarly just meant for entertainment, not a good source for anything. NTDTV, The Epoch Times, they are owned by Falungong, a religious cult, extremely biased against China. Add Zee news :P BBC for India related news is an atrocious source. The way they downplay incidents would bring tears of joy into the eyes of NDTV. What's left. I have no news sources now that I can use after seeing this list. :( Firstpost used to be the first site I check out each day. But stopped using their site completely some six months ago. Just sensational titles and complete bullshit in the articles. the indian express is both in the recommended list and in not recommended list Russia Today. It's basically a propaganda channel for the Kremlin.  firstpost.
Firstpost is not a real news paper.
It is just opinion in Trying to pretend to be better than other papers in use of English Language.
Scoopwoop.
The logical Indian..
Scroll I dislike the following for their agendas, lack of ethics, pretentiousness, lying, yellow journalism and various other factors  :

1) Scroll


2) Tehelka


3) Cobra post

4) jantakareporter

5) Kafila

6) Carvan

These all seem like some trash straight out of jhola of some JNU trash. The kind which wears kurta with chappals and drinks coffee in starbucks, gets drunk almost anywhere while abusing corporates


Among more mainstream:

1) TOIlet, is shit because all they know is to sell propaganda in guise of news.

2) The Hindu, so obvious left bias that it's not even funny. Pretends to be neutral, almost never accepts wrong reporting and in many cases, they just post whatever they can get away with. Their defence and science pages used to be nice. But haven't read the paper in years now.


3) Indian Express, Shekhar Gupta and Swamy are definitely on Paki payrolls. Manufacturing news like army coup to dishonour an upright general who firmly said no to corruption was just one of the lows this paper has gone to. Swamy is a perfect example of yellow journalism. Shiv Aroor when working for IE, routinely used to publish crap against armed forces, changed tone after leaving.


4) Hindustan Times, almost a complete Congress mouthpiece.




Among TV channels:

Any channel which employs Nidhi razdan, Barkha, Sardesai, Sagarika, Sreenivasan Jain and a couple of other soulless shameless turds of pressitutes. Includes NDTV, CNN-IBN and a few usual suspects.

 Thanks very much for this post! I raked up the courage to unfollow IBN and TOI from my Facebook. Personally speaking, they are sensational to the bone! Do add a few good media list too.  PRSIndia.org is good for legislation and parliamentary news. Is there any way to ban the websites reported here? by ban means not allowed to post on /r/india. Add dawn.com  it's a cesspool  Modi worshippers..(many) I blocked all these news sources long back on fb and twitter (so they actually see the impressions drop) and only subscribe to PTI/AIR and what other real people share.

I wish enough people block these sources using filtering so that they get the message and results in collective good. You forgot to add buzzfeed to the bad list (Clickbait)",2015-08-18 14:57:39

But we can have relations with countries without looking everything from Chinese glasses. 

Mongolia is just across one country from us. It's a shame that we don't have a [close relationship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India–Mongolia_relations) with them as we should have. All this time governments were afraid of ruffling Chinese feathers. why do these media cartoons write these idiotic headlines? There is life after China. This is more an attempt to forge better relations with India's neighbours and nearby countries.  If so, it's pointless. One Mongolia is nothing compared to what China is doing in Indian ocean. Chinese interests appear to be more pro-China than anti-India focused as such. They want new markets, new opportunities and resources, and they are actively developing it where ever they can. I think India should focus on competing them at that level, rather than doing something because it's anti-China, IMHO. Slightly off topic but in Mongolia, they drink horse's milk. No Doubt , very smart move. As China encircles India - India made a move where it will be sitting on top of it. But, at what cost ? With US technology ? 
China can not be shaken unless it's economy is not shaking....and when it will shake - China will make sure that many shakes with him. 
Perhaps, this is where whole game is going to. With desperation seeping in US and UK over economy and pressure from extremism .....world is perhaps inching towards making teams and playing big games now ! Ghar ke ladke dibba chat rahe, aur baharwale ladko ko sab aata ?",2015-05-18 09:46:03

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

",DexterMilburn," This thread series is my favorite of all and I feel like I should start something similar for civic issues and RTI.  1) the rio tinto mine goes through the panna national park area and I don't know how happy I am about that 

2) the sun Edison blew in the face man.  They bid aggressively in reverse auction in national solar parks which was paraded with so much galore, only knowing that it's pretty much not in tune with market price 

3) how's Tata Tiago? Thinking of buying a small car for mother  Bad loans being bought by ARCs... Sounds familiar. Precursor to new economic disasters to come?

But it will be a waste of time. So just leave it at a simple ""NO"".
 To become super power, we need economic power. For economic power, we need human resources power and lot of enabling factors. For human resources power, we need better education, health. Tell me again how we are doing in education and health again. Present youth gen has learnt shit in schools are colleges. I hope next gen has better luck.

That's just wishful thinking on most Indians part. Most foreigners just view India is just a larger version of Africa and Indonesia because they have a very large number of poor people \+ unemployed and that most elites know that it will usually lead to nowhere. Nothing more.

>What I see happening however is China's autocratic leadership isn't able to squash it's own \>people. Which leads to social and political unrest causing an economic slowdown. This will take \>30\-40 years at the minimum.

Even at that stage, China's economy will still be many times larger than India \+ they have A.I. and robots to deal with their economic/workforce slowdown/reduction\(so many articles on google and the web about how they are gonna dominate this industry\) unless something miraculous starts happening like India starts growing at 10&#37;\+\+\+ every year for 2\-3 decades and that's a huge IF.

>At this point though, India is large enough an economy that it starts taking over the mantle \>from China about Asian leadership. And genuinely rises in influence and power to be called a \>superpower. Do you see that happening? And which factors will actually hasten this process?

Most of India are still gonna be mired in poverty. Same situation as Africa and Indonesia right now. Ask yourself if the outside world have given them any respect despite growing their economic size without condoms or birth control? OK, maybe Indonesia have done more than Africa and India at this issue but my main gist of my argument still stands. The world only respects countries with either Oil, Strong Military, Huge Economy, Good Education, Advanced Technology and Infrastructure. China is leading or catching up quickly to the West and other first world countries in many of those aspects.

>Some dramatic changes in policy? Takeover from an authoritarian regime \(some would argue we're \>in one right now\)?

Maybe but it's gonna be very bloody. Unlike your average East Asians\(Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Koreans\) who tend to be very meek and subservient, South Asians generally wouldn't have a stand for it and will most likely ignite a civil war leading to the eventual fall of South Asia. The first question is why India wants to be a super power. Will it matter when we became super power still have poverty and unjust society? 
There is a lack of entrepreneurs in the manufacturing sector in India. People dont have any 'know how' of how to setup a manufacturing plant. 

Entrepreneurs in food sector are plenty, even a chhole kulche vala is an entrepreneur. If a person fails to do anything in India, they think food business is the best bet and thats true too because they do earn a living from it. But is it helping India's development, no!

Govt of India must focus more on EDPs, reducing tariff and non-tariff IT barriers, improving education quality, and improved financing system.

Only entrepreneurs make an economy self sufficient.

The day when India has produced enough entrepreneurs, that day we will achieve true independance.

Policy/Economy,My predictions for economy in coming days and Modi's Grand plan!,44,4p36hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4p36hm/my_predictions_for_economy_in_coming_days_and/,104,"First thing first, Now that Raghuram Rajan is out.
Next thing on Modi's List is to appoint his one more chamcha, as this has been followed across multiple appointments in recent times, and i am betting all my shares on Arvind Panagarhia, the guy with a record for licking his ass.
What next you ask?
Well, pretty easy to guess in next monetary policy review meeting u will get a massive rate cut to pump cheap money in order to boost manufacturing and consumption
well this might seems good in a very short run will have a really bad impact on our robust fundamentals built by rajan over the long period of time.
The same bad fundamentals which have resulted in a bad economy in many western countries and experiencing hard time passing over it.
I am being cynical here, but i guess thats grand picture by modi, to show this mirage to fellow indians who will make sure to vote him in power again  in 2019!
I am open to more ideas and predictions",meetmanav," So, here is how it works .

Interest rates in India are at 8%, Brazil is at 7% , China at 6% , Malaysia and Philippines at about 4%.

Let's say  - You are a US manufacturing company.  Or a European car manufacturer ;you need to start a business - let's say outsource your manufacturing or create a new plant for export to developing market.

You would need to raise a share of the capital locally unless your pockets are already heavy and drooping because of all the moolah. Plus local partnerships and whatnot. 

If the Philippines offers you a similar labor cost, easy availability of land, and cheaper cash vis a vis India ... you're more likely to invest there.
Locals, when they see their savings returning next to nothing are more likely to park their money elsewhere . Stocks, commodities, gold and property.

On the flipside , easy availability of cash in the market means that a high demand for the above has been created. Means property is likely to get more expensive, stocks valued higher, same for commodities .... something that fucks up inflation. This takes a few months after interest rate changes. You also tend to piss off pensioners this way.

Now the impact of inflation is directly felt by the populace. Older people , pensioners,  and civil workers would hate the government for it. Inflation can lose elections for governments.

It is the Job of the Governer of the RBI to maintain this delicate balance between inflation , lending rates and borrowing rates. This has a direct impact on the trust of the stock markets . 

R3 might have been a good economist and would have made a great governor again, but the kind of Rajan pooja I see on randia is fucking retarded to the highest degree. 
These positions work on consensus of large teams and great amounts of data, and it would take a special kind of visionary moron to fuck it up

TL; DR - no-one gives a flying fuck about what you or I think.  The RBI would do it's job regardless of who the top-man is . Enough of this armchair economics randia !



Edit 1:  Want to know more about the interest rates around the globe - here you go - http://www.worldinterestrates.info/ What credentials? Who gives a hoot in hell what you think if you're not knowledgeable. 

What do you base this upon? 

Degree from Yale? Stanford? Harvard?

Do tell.

I am dying to know.  We need a good booming solid economy and there's no reason rate cuts will not get us there. But capitalism itself is cyclical in nature. There will be a bust some day no matter what and how we get there.  Why is that a bad thing? With the major world economies in a bad state, now is the time for us to seize the advantage. 

Rajan did his job in stabilizing our fundamentals and now I feel that the benefits of rate cuts will far outweigh the harm that you are predicting.  /r/shittyconspiracytheories are...thataway. India has 300 million people who have to be employed in the next 10 years.
For this, India needs to create jobs. for jobs we want more industries to come up. Especially SME's. Current interest rates are not viable to start these industries.
With a new RBI guv,perhaps this can be fixed.

IF the people who voted for modi vote for him in 2019, it is enough for Namo to come back. You might dislike Modi as much as you like, but you probably know that **Modi will not let the RSS/Swamy messup the economy**. 

He will let RSS have its way with culture/education/arts/health/research - but economy is far too important for Modi to mess up. 

Rajan's shoes are difficult to fill, but I am pretty sure Modi will find someone good for the job. Wow. Are you an edgy kid? There was a time when people could get their point across without sounding like Rakhi Sawant. Before we go any further, we need to know – are you a fan of Bayes' rule? Rate cuts are coming. Adani needs to borrow cheap. 

NPAs are going to be hidden again because who wants to return money when they can get away with it. 

Bail outs are coming because the tax payers will always end up paying for acche din of defaulters. Dont know about a chamcha, but he will def employ someone willing to toe his line on easy monetary policy. Cut rates, boost asset prices. Sensex touches 30,000 and jaitley and co. come out dancing on TV channels. 


Inflation starts rising, asset bubbles start forming and GDP growth goes to 9-10%

Yay Achhe Din!


2018 rolls around and Jaitley does a magic trick in his budget speech to appease the masses. Loan forgiveness, sops for the middle class and traders. 


All this while, Reliance refinances its loans and rolls out Jio. Banks are bailed out and are ready for another rave party. Rupee keeps trending downwards making exports cheaper but oil imports expensive. Balance of payment situation is OK or deteriorating. 


Corporate balance sheet improves as banks refi all bad loans. Mallaya is also forgiven. 


2018 - some non issue creeps up - a mini riot, ram temple, beef eating, ghar wapsi, love jihad. Enough to polarize the Hindus to vote for Modi.

Modi is re elected and the whole cycle starts again.  I agree 100% ( not on arvind he may chose anyone of his chamchas for rate cut) and his recent push on FDI too indicates the same .

I think Modi has fallen in his own trap of Acche Din and he thinks that easy money - big corporate loan can do good things for him . This plot has so many holes that i can only laugh , in short run , it will definitely cause inflation . 

I think Modi has just ensured 2019 won't be his term bcoz Indians like most people hate inflation especially the masses or maybe he has just ensured party funds for 2019 from big corporates and at the opportune time people will be mass-distracted to poll on emotive issues ( may be small scale multiple riots all across India , one can see the plot unfolding in UP ) . 

> pump cheap money in order to boost manufacturing and consumption

To add to it , there is a very aggressive push gng on in South Chhattisgarh against naxals , which is largely centered around only those areas where mines have been allotted , even forest right act which ensures land right to tribals are being diluted to ease acquisition and mining  Rate cuts will push up asset prices in a short while; but they will not revive capex everything is in overcapacity and demand is weak. Years of inflation and a falling savings rate has killed the consumer. Companies don't invest without demand. 

Having said that as crude prices start to get priced in and along with loose monetary and inflation riises and real rates become negative; you'll see asset prices fall as foreign capital starts to leave. And to defend the INR the government will be forced to raise interest which will then tank asset prices and we'll be back to square one i.e where we were when Rajan took over in 2013 with the end of the UPA.

Oh and further malinvinvestment in the short run will end up causing a banking crisis eventually. ",2016-06-21 14:05:10
Policy/Economy,Calls to weaken rupee are misguided,23,6wdoen,http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/6Xe8JxAhukvO3umuooK5JM/Calls-to-weaken-rupee-are-misguided.html,1,,pannagasamir," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**Calls to weaken rupee are misguided** 

 ______ 
Rather like Goldilocks, commentators on the Indian rupee don’t like the value of the currency too low or too high—they would like it just right. Thus, when the rupee is weak, there are complaints that it is too weak; with a strong rupee, there are complaints that it is too strong. It is understandable that industry shills should press for a weakening of the rupee. But it is not just those with a vested interest in promoting domestic industry who are crying foul— eminent economists have now joined the fray. In this newspaper, former chief economic adviser Deepak Nayyar and economist Ajit Ranade have batted for a weaker rupee in the past few weeks. Nayyar, in particular, is explicit that this is best achieved through lowering the policy interest rate, which, it is alleged, is too high.

Unfortunately, such arguments suffer from the fallacy of thinking that the tail wags the dog. It is not that the rupee is too strong relative to the US dollar, but rather that the US dollar is weak—relative to a wide range of currencies, not just the rupee.

The figure shows a broad trade-weighted US dollar index from July 2016 to the present, and this clearly reveals that after a period of steady appreciation culminating approximately at the time that Donald Trump was inaugurated US president, the dollar has been steadily depreciating.

The rupee’s initial weakening followed by strengthening is a mirror image of this. Indeed, the dollar shows broadly similar behaviour vis-a-vis a range of advanced and emerging economy currencies. The fundamental driver is perhaps the market’s sense that Trump’s economic programme—tax cuts and infrastructure spending—is floundering. It is noteworthy that even with monetary tightening, the dollar has been weakening.

The real story is thus of dollar weakness, not rupee strength, and this turns the analysis on its head. For there is little if anything that Indian monetary authorities can—or should—do in the face of a fluctuating dollar, beyond attempting to smooth excess volatility. As it happens, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does intervene in currency markets, exactly for this reason, not to alter the underlying market-determined path of the exchange rate.

There is a second key proposition that critics miss. In a world of open capital markets, and in which the central bank wishes to pursue an independent monetary policy—in the case of India and many others, that choice is inflation targeting—we must, perforce, accept that the nominal exchange rate will be largely market-determined. In other words, you cannot simultaneously pursue an independent monetary policy and control the exchange rate—a fundamental insight that we owe to the Nobel economist Robert Mundell and to which many critics seem strangely oblivious.

Unless critics would like India to abandon our inflation-targeting monetary policy regime and substitute it with a fundamentally different system, such as fixing the exchange rate to the US dollar or something else equally radical, they cannot simultaneously grumble about the interest rate and the exchange rate in an open economy.

It is perfectly possible to debate whether the global economy is in need of systemic monetary reform, but that is very different from suggesting that India, acting alone, should abandon inflation targeting in favour of a more exotic policy approach. And, if we accept inflation targeting, or indeed any conventional flexible exchange-rate monetary policy regime, we must accept that the value of the rupee will be basically market-determined, full stop.

The truth is this: Those at present batting for a lower policy rate and/or a weaker rupee are, it would appear, concerned primarily with the interests of domestic Indian industry, not Indian consumers— who stand to benefit from a stronger rupee to the extent that, for instance, they purchase foreign goods or travel abroad— or indeed the economy as a whole.

Let us not forget that an artificially weakened currency can make up, at least for a while, for a multitude of sins, such as low productivity in domestic industry, and that is another reason why industry pushes for it. Why become more competitive and more efficient when, hey presto, your friendly neighbourhood central banker can bid down the value of the currency and let you stand on stilts for a while? This is an old trick. For instance, Canada for years cushioned low domestic productivity with a depreciated currency.

The RBI’s monetary policy committee is correctly focused on achieving the inflation-target mandate, and ought not to get distracted by the red herring that a strong rupee is hurting the economy.

Policy/Economy,A discussion on how India's economy and governance can be improved,42,5uq45j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5uq45j/a_discussion_on_how_indias_economy_and_governance/,39,"It should be priority number one to get more of our labour force into the organized sector of the economy, increase income levels and thus provide potentially many hundreds of millions of new tax payers. Currently somewhere around 2-3% of Indians pay income taxes (correct me if I;m wrong). This is a horrible tax base, loss of so much potential tax money for the government. This means that govt employees (babus, netas, teachers, judges, diplomats) get payed a piss poor amount. Perfect incentive for corruption. Singapore pays their govt employees extremely well and have almost no corruption because there's no need to be corrupt (cause they are already rich). So thus it is crucial in the long run to increase our tax base and pay our public sector employees better. But that's easier said than done. What do you guys suggest are good policies to obtain this higher tax base?",Attila_ze_fun," Digitization is a very good way to increase the tax base. Sweden began digitization from 1960s by asking all employers to pay salaries through electronic transfer rather than cash and today over 98% of all transaction is through digital means, nobody can hide his income and evade tax. When everybody pays tax, the rates can come down which will benefit the current tax payers as well, it will also help reduce inflation as the govt will not be required to print money to compensate for the revenue deficit which will leave people with more money in their hands. What Sweden could achieve in about 50 years can be achieved in a few years as the technology is far advanced and cheaper today. The incentive on cash must go, the moment that happens people will automatically shift to digital, now a days everybody has access to cashless payment and banking, there is no reason why India can't go digital in a few years time. To my mind, there are two major challenges. 

The **first** is the black economy. It was estimated at around 5% at the time of independence but now the latest estimate is closer to 62%. There have been 40 commissions on the topic in India over the years and some of them have been doing estimates. It has been an-ever rising trend. 

In fact, according to Arun Kumar, India's leading authority on the black economy, India [would have a 15 trillion dollar economy](https://youtu.be/AHTVbMV5x9w?t=27m7s) right now if it had no black economy. 

The **second** challenge is insufficient job creation in the formal sector. Creating jobs, as measured by the NSSO surveys, is not enough. That's because most people in India don't have formal contracts with employer and social benefits. 

This is problematic for poverty, because it leaves them *very* vulnerable for even minor shocks such as an child going ill and needing attention at home. But there are also economic implications, because informal employment is typically very low productivity. 

This means that if a large portion of society remains stuck in informal work, then India's GDP growth will taper off as it moves up the value chain. Already, India has a much larger share of informal employment than even peer countries like Vietnam. China only has 25%, whereas India is at 93%. I'm not counting informal employees in the organised sector(because they are a lot closer to productivity to those in the unorganised sector). I'm just counting those with formal contracts, wherever they work. 

The total amount of formal employment in India has been [very slow](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=15804). From 1991 to 2011 it only increased by about 8 million jobs even as the workforce expanded by 230 million. Modi talked loosely about creating two crores jobs per year. The government data [isn't encouraging](http://i.imgur.com/xVGlZ1s.png). 

 > Currently somewhere around 2-3% of Indians pay income taxes

Let us analyze this statement, which the FM and IT Dept. always use. A large part of the work force is employed in agriculture, which is not subject to IT (estimates of around 40%). So, we are using an incorrect denominator to calculate the percentage. 

I could not find 2011 Census analysis on economic activity, but here is what the 2001 census says - 40 crore work force, out of which over 20% or 9 crore is marginal. Out of the 40 crore, 23 crore is engaged in agriculture, including agriculture labour. Appx. 15 crore is the non-agriculture workforce as calculated by the 2001 census. A substantial portion of this would have an income below the taxable limit. Now, if you calculate the tax payers out  of 15 crore, you will find that 20% to 30% of the non-agricultural workforce is paying Income Tax. 

The problem is that small and medium businesses do not pay their correct share of taxes. Catching them would take effort, and would cut into the bribes that they give out, and hence, no one is interested in going after them. I remember that every economic class would have a chapter on contribution by SSE to exports, GDP, employment etc., but what is their contribution to Taxes? Go after their consumption figures, use presumptive taxes to make things easier for them (it has been done to some extent recently). 

>  This means that govt employees (babus, netas, teachers, judges, diplomats) get payed a piss poor amount. 

As far as pay to government employees is concerned, they get paid very high at the junior levels, and low at the senior levels. This inversion is a problem. But, look at the large number of people employed in useless activity. Railways as the largest employer have a bloated workforce, and the same is true for most PSUs and government departments. The useless bureaucracy creates useless work for itself. We end up affording less employees in law enforcement, public law and order and judiciary. Look at the large number of employees in every municipality and the poor state of our municipal services. This administrative reform is something that would lose votes, and would require guts, and that is something I don't see happening. At the lower levels, there is no employment generation, and governments find it easy to hire more staff in bureaucracies. We should be focussing on businesses which can generate employment. It is foolish to assume that service industry can absorb a large portion of the workforce. We have to encourage manufacturing. Unfortunately, our labour laws, tax laws, and other restrictions on manufacturing have destroyed the competitiveness of Indian industry. One of the reasons that InfoTech developed was that the workforce was specifically excluded from labour laws, and earlier, their entire export income was exempt from taxes. [deleted] The governments keep pushing for decentralisation of administration. Anecdotal evidence, in my state the government worked best when it was under President's rule. The bureaucracy were terrified of being fired or punished but when it changed back into normal state, inefficiency, lateness and corruption returned. I think we need to overhaul the bureaucracy, whereby, supervision and efficacy is regularly tested by the central government Add more women in the workforce and pursue friendly relations with China and Pakistan.If we have friendly neighbours, we can spend less on defense and lower it to about 40 billion dollars from 50 billion dollars.This money should be spent on education.Also,upgrade existing infrastructure and not needlessly spend on shiny new things. I think if the judiciary was strengthened along with the police system, India's governance issues will improve. If people had a solid guaranteed non-corrupt form of redressal as well as a ruthlessly efficient justice system, a lot of problems plaguing India now, including tax evasion, will melt away.  
    
Police need to be strong to supplement the judiciary and uphold the law. All agencies with police power are included in this.  
  
Without this India cannot move forward, because it will be hard to implement new laws or punish people for not following these laws. The courts and the cops need to have teeth and be free to bite the right things.  - Digital transactions linked to PAN and Aadhar Card
- Cash transactions limited to 2 Lakh
- Strict laws if anyone do not follow above rule
- Education of tax to common people
-  Open Tax Centers for everyone to easily seek help and guidance 
- Hiring lots and lots and lots of people in Income Tax Dept 
- Closing common loopholes
- Try to outsmart tax evaders  >This means that govt employees (babus, netas, teachers, judges, diplomats) get payed a piss poor amount. Perfect incentive for corruption.

lol. How do you explain MBA's and Phd's lining up for sweeper and clerical jobs provided by government. We as a country are doomed. We can have good governments, that reduces corruption, but the very next moment after it goes down, we are back to square one. The only way this country gets out of this trap is through change in the mindset of population. Which is almost impossible, because people with privilege will never want to give it up. 

We can pin our hopes on future generations, but that is another exercise in futility. All you need to do is to go out and interact with them. You can see this country is going to go down fast. 

I might sound super pessimistic, but I'm not far from reality. 

Only way is to make reforms in education, and cross our fingers and hope that in about 20 or 30 years, there is change.  Like Chile, Hong Kong, and Singapore did, we need to pursue neoliberal reforms like FDI, labour reform, and privatization to allow our economy to grow faster. The less government involvement and regulation, the less impact corruption has.

The government should hire solely based on merit and hire using market salaries to get competent people. The attitude also has to change that instead of the people being the servants of the government (communist thinking), the government should be the servant of the people. [deleted] Tempted to suggest supporting a hotline to report corruption and tax evading so the government can confiscate money.  Whistleblowers get a cut.

But I think it'll go poorly when society turns on itself.",2017-02-18 09:46:09

Will impact many negatively in the not-so-short term.

That was notional loss, this is actual loss.  Not every notional loss is a scam. It becomes a scam when the person/party gains from the bad policy. Coal scam was done by competent crooks while demonetization is the result of incompetence. Because the bhakt army can't see the jizz on 56 inches chin.

The analytical solution would help the income tax department gather data received from banks, post offices and other sources for linking of information and identification of duplicate details.

New Delhi: To plug tax loopholes, the income tax (I-T) department will use Big Data analytics to track down evaders by collecting information such as common address, mobile number and e-mail to establish relationship between their multiple PANs. The department, with support from private firms, will analyse the voluminous data available post demonetisation for checking relationships between PAN holders.

The managed service provider (MSP), which the I-T department plans to hire, will design and operationalise analytical solution that will help collating data, matching it and identifying relationships as well as clustering of PAN and non-PAN data, an official said.

The analytical solution would help the department gather data received from banks, post offices and other sources for linking of information and identification of duplicate details. It will also identify records with errors or other defects for resubmission.

“The data quality errors and defects will be communicated to the reporting person or entities, say, banks or post offices for correction and improving data quality,” the official added.

The data integration and matching of the PAN based demonetisation information with that of I-T databases such as tax returns, TDS, third-party reporting, tax payments, would be used to build a comprehensive profile for the taxpayer. It will help identify link between PAN holders on the basis of relationships (business association, asset and transactional association) available in various databases, the official said, adding that the analytics will do clustering of PAN-linked demonetised data using identified relationships as well as common address, mobile number, e-mail and bank branch.

Also, it will cluster non-PAN demonetised data using common name, address, mobile number, e-mail and bank branch. Taxpayer segmentation on the basis of taxpayers’ status, type of ITR form used, nature of business, taxpayer segment, age of the individual and compliance history will also have to be prepared. It will prioritise demonetisation data based on taxpayer segment, relationships, clusters, rules and risk matrix.

“Different types of interventions (send e-mail, SMS, outbound call, letter, notice, verification, investigation) can be selected for taxpayer priority and segment,” the official added.

**Overseas investors bullish on India dollar debt even as economy slows; here’s why** 

 ______ 
For all the weak spots in India’s economy, investor love for the nation’s offshore bonds endures.Companies have sold $10.6 billion of dollar debt so far in 2017, the most in three years, as one of the highest returns in Asia and prospects of a sovereign-rating upgrade prompt buyers to ignore data showing gross domestic product in the June quarter expanded at the slowest pace since 2014.“There’s not only large institutional demand but also high retail appetite,” A.S. Thiyaga Rajan, a senior managing director at Aquarius Investment Advisors in Singapore, said by phone. “Some top Indian names are coming up” with dollar debt offerings, he said.The optimism around Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic policies and prospects of outsized profits are proving hard to resist for bond bulls. Dollar-denominated debt from India has returned 5.68 percent this year, compared with 4.95 percent in China and 2.98 percent in South Korea, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes.There’s more juice left in the rally, according to Anthony Leung, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo & Co.‘Good Value’India’s investment-grade company bonds “remains a pocket of good value” across Asia and the steps taken by Modi’s government are “steering the economy in the right direction,” he wrote in a Sept. 7 note. While challenges remain in cleaning up bad loans at banks, the start of an unified sales tax, abolition of subsidies and low oil prices will help offset the problems, he said.The policy measures are bearing fruit and will lead to the nation’s credit rating being raised by Moody’s Investors Service “within a year,” Leung said. A Moody’s spokesperson said the firm does not comment on third-party speculation on ratings.Rating firms have India just above “junk” status and while Modi’s government has pushed for an upgrade in the past few years, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have all pushed back, citing high debt levels.Green BondsThat said, the unexpected slowdown in growth hasn’t put investors off India’s corporate debt or slowed new issuance. Buyers have drawn confidence from the fact that the nation is still one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and a strong political mandate gives Modi more policy flexibility to revive expansion.Power Finance Corp., a state-run lender to utilities, has sought bids from credit rating firms for its $1 billion medium-term notes. Bharat Petroleum Corp. plans to raise $500 million via Singapore-listed bonds, Director of Finance K. Sivakumar said Tuesday. State Bank of India plans to raise up to $3 billion in the nation’s biggest overseas green-bond issue, the Economic Times reported last week, citing an unnamed executive close to the initiative.“There’s more demand than supply for Indian bonds as investors bet on the outlook of the Modi-led economy,” said Bryan Wang, a fund manager at Fuh-Hwa Investment Trust Co. in Taipei.

**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big
Belt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much
wailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is
practically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that
dozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of
their governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government
deliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as
stubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.

Well, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign
policy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on
grounds that are both principled and realist.

The government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-
articulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that
""connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility
to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;
balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;
transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to
help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local
communities."" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the
path of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-
initiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were
clearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the
sustainability issues involved.

While India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it
is not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The
Guardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the
resolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental
reasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of
""isolation"" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign
up to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India
is the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the
subject, and of that we can be proud.

Let's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take
advantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free
country and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian
manufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by
China, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.
It is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what
OBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own
position in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will
not, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in
particular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on
infrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS
Bank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.
This is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently
violate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would
fail to uphold.

This is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has
taken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In
almost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of
Manmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in
such matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the
Singh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's
sensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:
Beijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's ""core
interests"". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to
the Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-
II, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact
with Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would
also have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit
from the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's
sensitivities.

By taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi
has done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand
on a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.

There are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is
essentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and
economics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a
leader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an
alternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-
driven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's
America turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free
movement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles
everywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.

And second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this
regard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which
serve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries
and economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,
Singapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.

Modi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning
to deliver. He must keep going.

Policy/Economy,NDA vs. UPA - Same Data Different Stories,49,1v78mm,http://i.imgur.com/msFKJKfh.jpg,34,,st_hill," I am not economist.Current GDP growth estimate by IMF is 4.7% some say actual was 3.5% while CPI inflation is 11.5 %. Indian economy is in total mess if they fail to fix it, it may have similar effect like Argentina. Fast growing China has inflation of 3%  UPA-1 did achieve some good economic figures.
It consequently won.. 

What we should truly evaluate is UPA-2?

I guess the figures would be very different. 



 This is a stupid way of presenting data. Why don't you just show the trend line? These tables are highly prone to misinterpretations. For example, UPA is a 10-year time period vs BJP, a 5 year time period. Best year GDP growth of 9.6 in UPA might be in 2004/2005/2006...which has absolutely no relevance to the disaster that UPA-II is today. It is very much possible that UPA-I reaped the benefits of BJP's policies. 

TL;DR: Just show us the trendline instead of cherry picking data. UPA I reaped the good sowing of NDA..UPA II is reaping the bad sowing of UPA I. In the NDA years, GDP growth was increasing, while in the UPA years, GDP growth turned negative. When NDA started their term, GDP was near 4-5% growth rate, when they ended, GDP growth was at 8.1%. When UPA started their term, GDP growth was at 8.x%, it peaked at 9% and is now down back to 4-5%. UPA-1 inherited a healthy economy from NDA. It was a ride while it lasted. 

UPA-2 suffered because of UPA-1.   So, effectively, UPA managed to magically turn every single rising graph into a falling graph. Spectacular. 

http://planningcommission.nic.in/data/datatable/1612/table_2.pdf 

In 1997-98 (Non NDA Gov), the GDP was 4.2%

NDA boosted it 8.3% by 2003-04. This momentum was maintained in UPA 1 tenure [but later it you see the graph is moving downward.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-growth-annual) 

In 1998, Infaltion was at 8.26%, by 2004 NDA brought it down to 2.80%. But UPA 1 boosted inflation to 8.70% by 2009 itself!

UPA has been in office for 123 months now and the number of months for which the food inflation stayed above 10% is 78. Thats almost 63% of their total tenure.

Comparing to NDA, they lasted for 72 months, in which the food inflation stayed above 10% only for about 12 months i.e 17% of their tenure. 

Now, i don't know about food prices and other commodity prices, but they surely gone up by 90-900% since the UPA regime took over.

Talking about Fiscal deficit, it was -6.29 in 1998-99, NDA reduced it to -3.88 by 2004. However post 2004, fiscal deficit kept on increasing and now its stands at - 5.15.


 [NDA had current account surplus in 2002, 2003, 2004 \(Again as per above links\). The current account deficit was -2 in 1998. NDA did a nice job and brought it to +2.3 in 2004 which UPA reduced to -5.15 at present. 
](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/current-account)

Regarding jobs, NDA created ~61 million jobs, however UPA 1 could only managed to create 2.7million.

 
Also the savings rate was increased from 23.19% in 1998-99 to 32.41 by 2004. Now its 30.81. 

Regarding exchange rate, the depreciation was of 9% during NDA tenure. Its more than 35% during UPA tenure. 

And lastly, the above data of  showing average scores is basically to fool the voters. We were not hit hard by any recession (and this is not i am saying. It was said by Dr. Singh himself). 

Sources: Mostly from tradingeconomics.com, RBI, Nassco, planning commission, Livemint claim check.  
 Inflation, price rise and massive unemployment neutralized most of the UPA's GDP growth rate and prevented it from actually reaching the people. Try this for perspective.

http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fI98V9JE8uOmAhVS0fjhQO/Claim-Check-Narendra-Modi-on-jobs-created-by-NDA-vs-UPA.html

>The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government created 60 million jobs during its tenure in 1999-2005 as against 2.7 million created during 2004-2009 under the current United Progressive Alliance government. This is called being unambiguous with facts but being open with interpretation. Pretty much my employer's policy. wait... so why is UPA so bad? can i add the [R] tag here.. UPA-I was quite successful,it may not be popular opinion here but India did weather financial crisis better than others.

However UPA-II performed substantially worse because of high interest rates to curb inflation which tanked the growth. http://i.imgur.com/IgMyx.gif",2014-01-15 00:53:34
Policy/Economy,[Scheduled]The population debate: The depopulation phase of India and it's impact of the economy,58,56bi87,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/56bi87/scheduledthe_population_debate_the_depopulation/,50,"Here's a question:
We know through stats that around 2050-60, the population the country will fall down, and with an estimated 2-digit trillion economy, we will see the rise of the GDP per capita.

This is all WITH the current TFR (It is at a replacement rate). Now we change some data shall we? The goverment decides that from tomorrow, would apply mandatory childless policies. It's illegal to procreate and people would need to adopt children if they want to be, you know, parents. Amazing! Orphans would get new homes and they are really happy (Let us assume, they law is perfectly enforced).

The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down. However, there's this problem: We have a lot old people, and the thing is *they can't work*. Especially a country like India, where there is huge population and on top of that: *a huge old population*. How are we going to give them pensions? Government would *spend* more than *gain* more? An old poor population isn't a very good incentive for FDI either. How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

Ninja edit: some words

edit 2: I'm not against depopulation, but I believe there are multiple ways to solve the population problem.",miguel-styx," Childfree is only thing going to save India from catastrophe of Water shortage, malnutrition, Quality education, natural resources stress, Urban problems, overcrowding. Climate change is already making all problems worse, just look at farmers 300 million people were affected by Drought in last 2 years. farmers in India suffer from very high levels of malnutrition due to lack of awareness and low incomes.

Isn't it shocking that 700 million people in India still depend on Agriculture?

Yes Indian economy would grow but only top 20-30%( maybe 400 million people) of people are going gain hugely, the bottom 20% people will still suffer problems due to climate change. Either we make a decision now or forever be condemn to 3rd or 2nd world status. Simple answer is from 1.3 billion people, if Childfree policy is implemented today, India will still have billion people in couple of decades. Even if De-population occurs we will still have billion people.

If say India reaches 2.0 fertility rate in next five years and continuues trends, India will have 1.8 billion people by 2060.

So if Indians want to have any kind of decent life, de-population is the way. 1 billion people is better than 1.8 billion people.

So, what about dependency? **Problems of dependency are easy to solve than massive problems of India today or problems with 1.8 billion people.** Childfree is only thing going to save India from catastrophe of Water shortage, malnutrition, Quality education, natural resources stress, Urban problems, overcrowding. Climate change is already making all problems worse, just look at farmers 300 million people were affected by Drought in last 2 years. farmers in India suffer from very high levels of malnutrition due to lack of awareness and low incomes.

Either we make a decision now or forever be condemn to 3rd or 2nd world status. I am going to get downvoted to hell for saying this here but Childfree is not a solution. You don't stop eating food when you weight 200 kilos. You cut down the diet, learn how to do it, get discipline about it and implement it in your life. Agreed, in this case, you won't see any quick results in 6 months but educating Indians about the evils of many kids will go a long way. People need to understand, giving birth to a lot of kids is never the solution. However, if someone has the capacity to raise kids, I believe, they should have/adopt as many as they can handle. If you are an educated person and marry someone with a good background, you can raise a kid who will be an asset to the world instead of a liability. Think about that before you pushing Childfree on everyone. Yes, it will take down population drastically but a lot of people will lead an extremely unhappy, miserable life. That is just we'll have to live with. The transition phase from parents depending on 3-4 kids to care for them in their old age to parents saving for themselves or depending on 1 kid at max would be difficult but inevitable. Middle class older people do have savings to take them through retirement, but poorer classes will find this especially difficult. Depopulation policy? What are you going to do? Send the police to raid the bedrooms You have raised very valid questions. The kids on this forum do not understand this and will argue the toss with you for the next 20 years but, well, they are kids. I should know. I had the same views till a few years ago.  
  
Heck, these kids are more intelligent and more humane than I was. I was thinking up ways to mass murder millions of people.  
  
Now coming back to your questions: These are questions to which even the developed world is seeking answers. So far their only solution is mass immigration. Remember Germany's willingness to take in millions of asylum seekers/economic migrants? Solution to the same problem.  
  
A little known news item was the Portuguese asking the asylum seekers / migrants to come to Portugal.  
  
China relaxing the one-child policy? Another attempt at solving the same problem.  
  
I have a lot of Chinese friends and colleagues and talk to them all the time. All of them, without exception, are consumed by this same issue: how to take care of aging parents. The problem sir is jobs. The population isn't a number. It's people. How do you manage aspirations of millions of people who've going to struggle to get jobs in an increasingly hostile market? [removed] [deleted] [removed] You and the rest of the overpopulation crowd have an understanding of economics that is profoundly lacking. 

Per Capita GDP is not some hokey dokey ratio you can just tweak. Population and GDP and the nuances they contain are profoundly linked together. Those GDP growth forecasts are including the growth provided by a growing population.  [deleted] >The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down.

How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

India doesn't have a huge old age population. Look the numbers [here](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2010.html#in)

We have almost 40% people in the most productive age group. We have 27% of our population which would be ready to be enter in workforce 10 years from now and upto 14 years after that even if we just stop to procreate anymore. I don't think managing India's old age population or providing for them would ever be a problem of India.

Policy/Economy,[Politics] Is the golden age over for emerging markets?,18,64q0jq,http://www.livemint.com/Money/pcyXUJDZsh0G08fOB3XF7L/Is-the-golden-age-over-for-emerging-markets.html,2,,whiplash_14," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. 

 ______ 
**Is the golden age over for emerging markets?** 

 ______ 
The answer to that question is probably yes, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A chapter in its latest World Economic Outlook warns emerging economies they can no longer count on the benign external environment that had led to high economic growth in their economies in the last few decades.

It warns of “fading external tailwinds, including waning potential growth in advanced economies, slowdown and rebalancing in China, and a shift in the commodity cycle that has affected commodity exporters”. It says that, “Together with a risk of protectionism in advanced economies and tighter financial conditions as US monetary policy normalizes, these changes make for a more challenging external environment for emerging market and developing economies going forward.”

The chart paints a broad picture. It shows how the contribution of emerging markets to world growth increased from 18.2% during 1976-79 to 69.82% during 2010-15. The contribution of developing countries to world consumption rose even more markedly—from 13.9% during 1976-79 to 72% in 2010-15. But the rise of emerging markets is an old story. What’s new are the projections—the IMF forecasts that the contribution of emerging economies to both global growth and consumption will decrease during the period 2016-2021, as the chart indicates. True, the decrease is not much, but it does mark a turning point from the hefty increases of earlier decades.

How important are external conditions for growth in emerging markets? The IMF article says a 1 percentage point increase in domestic absorption by a country’s trading partners translates into around a fifth of the annual average growth in GDP per capita in emerging markets. And secondly, a 1 percentage point increase in the ratio of capital flows to GDP of emerging market and developing economies raises medium-term growth by 0.2 percentage points.

Taken together with higher growth on account of better terms of trade for commodities, the IMF estimates that over the past two decades, these factors accounted for more than half of medium-term growth, on average, across emerging market and developing economies. In turn, about half of the contribution to growth from external factors is due to higher capital inflows to emerging markets.

Will India too be affected? Well, India is one of those countries where domestic demand has been the mainstay of growth. But we shouldn’t underestimate the important part that external demand has played in supplementing that growth. One very important element of India’s liberalisation story and of its growth pick-up after liberalisation is the increase in its share of exports of goods and services to GDP from 6.8% in 1990-91 to 25% in 2013-14. The most rapid spurt happened in the early noughties, during the period of the global boom, when the ratio went up from 12.6% in 2001-02 to 23.7% in 2008-09.

As the IMF report says, “a favourable impulse from external demand and financial conditions helps medium-term growth outcomes by making growth accelerations more likely. It also reduces the likelihood of growth reversals.”

That’s not all. The rise in fund flows to the Indian stock markets during the noughties led to a boom in the secondary and primary equity markets, allowing companies to raise capital easily and lowering their cost of capital. This, in turn, sparked an investment boom and also led to higher employment, higher wages and consequently, to higher consumption. As the IMF says, “Capital inflows can enhance growth in emerging market and developing economies through various channels: augmentation of funds available for investment, transmission of crucial know-how and technological diffusion, and adoption of market discipline and better governance practices.”

Given the importance of the external sector, what then can be done to mitigate the impact of the headwinds mentioned above? The IMF believes that, faced with a potentially less supportive external environment than in the past, emerging market and developing economies can get the most out of a weaker growth impulse from external conditions by strengthening their institutional frameworks and adopting a policy mix that protects trade integration; permits exchange rate flexibility; and ensures that vulnerabilities stemming from high current account deficits and external debt, as well as high public debt, are contained.

These are all standard text-book remedies, but complying with them will be all the more important in a less benign external environment.

The markets, fixated perhaps on the short term, seem to be ignoring these long-run risks outlined by the IMF. As a recent Bank for International Settlements paper by Luis Awazu Pereira de Silva and Elod Takats says, “We are witnessing a departure from the policies of trade integration and multilateral cooperation that have been our successful recipe for the last 50 years. Is it purely rhetorical or real? Temporary or lasting? Is it linked to the current backlash against globalisation? Therefore, there is a disconnect between market exuberance and policy uncertainty. There are indeed threats to trade, financial integration and international cooperation that benefited both AEs and EMEs. These threats are increasing.”

Policy/Economy,"Why Rao is considered so Chankyan, a brief into into the 91 reforms",126,3lnf6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3lnf6a/why_rao_is_considered_so_chankyan_a_brief_into/,109,"The narrative about our BOP crisis today largely seems to be, India was almost bankrupt (true), IMF handed MMS (and Rao) a list of reforms, reforms passed, huzzzah!

The reality is very very different from this narrative. In reality, PVN had these massive issues to overcome,

* A minority govt
* A very partisan opposition (even more so than today). Atleast today the plank is supposedly 'development', back then it was all about ""garibi hatao"", ""support our PSU's to the death"". 
* Look at the seat strength the opposition had - JD+CPI held 102 seats, the BJP 120. These two combined alone could defeat any motion.

If you think the UPA had it tough, and the NDA has it tough today...think again. PVn had a minority govt, had to hardsell 'reforms' which were a very very dirty word back then, had to fight deeply vested interests. If we are a crony capitalist state today, in 1990, it was pretty much open house. Rules and policies were made by the Dhirubhai's.

How did he do all this? Read on,

To be fair to Rao, he was not a great economist, heck he was barely an economist, but he played the political game very well. He for instance put forth the idea of liberalising a very vocal sector (say mines), and then promptly backtrack (As though he was surrendering) and putting in its place a more...milder reform.

Look at how...spectacularly he played the New Industrial Policy of 91. It was a breathtaking move (for India) in that it virtually did away with Nehruvian era relics of licensing and control for industries. It could have boomeranged on him, so what does the sly fox do? Announce it the exact same day (At around 4 PM, to ensure it made the next days print news) of the budget for 91.

What did it look like? Mr MMS passed this reform. If it did boomerang? Who could be sacrificed? FUCK! I mean, you look at all this and you have to admire the sheer political statecraft of this wily old fox.

Look at broadly how well he handled this whole reform process? He first announced a broad slew of measures (to shut the IMF up), and then promptly delayed the introduction of bills or overall went very slow in actually bringing these into action. And then the rolling thunder movement, hit one broad policy front with mild reforms. Wait for fall out, quell it (with outright bribery if needed) and introduce a marginally more...powerful reform. On and on it went.

One thing he never did was pick a battle he knew he would lose. So he never went after the big PSU's, never the big vested interests, never the farm or social welfare schemes. He brilliantly picked the battles he knew he would win. He admired Willy Brandt and modelled himself on this other wily old fox.

The final piece of the puzzle! Despite being a politician, he never openly spoke about the reforms nor his overall aims. This kept everybody guessing and confused and he basically was free to do as he wished.  I think his brilliance can be explained simply by saying something he used to say often ""delaying or not taking a decision in itself was a decision"". This is most evident in the way he handled (again, quite spectacularly) the Fertilizer crisis. He had to reduce the fertilizer subsidies, but it was (and still is) a political hot potato. So what does the fox do? Again, push it via MMS, and when the shit storm hit, MMS ""offered his resignation"" which the fox graciously refused, AND then he sets up a committe, which mollifies the protestors, and then he passes the reforms with a 10% cut from the original increase.

I mean, this level of political guile and statecraft is just astonishing.

It is a fucking pity he didn't have a govt with absolute majority in the LS or that he didn't get a second term (sadly he was a Gandhi loyalist to a fault). If he had...

Not even touching the deft political moves, I mean this guy played all spectrums like it was a violin. Left? Check (V P Singh's faves, Montek Singh & Rakesh Mohan were his key advisors). BJP? Check. There is always this dark speculation though that he allowed Babri Masjid to be taken down, with the trade off that the BJP support his reforms, but this is and will remain unfounded speculation. He really was a supreme political master, and without him, not a single reform would have been passed.

I must point out, was he some sort of angel or something? No. He maybe was personally corrupt (we don't know), he associated with, nay was intimately associated with a deep rat bastard like Chandraswami. PVN had his flaws, but that shouldn't take away from his monumental achievements.

Why was the 91 budget so...landmark? Here are some top reasons why,

* Rupee was devalued, and devalued again.
* New trade policy favouring exporters (a bad word in the maai-baap socialistic model of Indira and Rajiv...not Nehru)
* Dismantled the license raj
* Put forth an austerity budget (before it was cool) and aimed straight away to cut deficit by 3-4% points.
* He near abolished export subsidies

[Further reading into the nature of the reforms, and just how fucked up our economy was in the 80's](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2004/wp0443.pdf)

",RajaRajaC," I always argue that PVNR is not given enough credits (may be cause he did not have the right surname or the right leanings) and that MMS is given too much credit for the 91 crisis handling.

Do share more reading material especially historical and political analysis of the period. Another thing people forget is that '91 was not the first time reforms were tried. Indira Gandhi in '66 and Rajiv Gandhi from '85-'87 had also tried some reforms. Indira Gandhi had to roll back pretty much all of those and adopt the socialist line because of two reasons: 1) She was at that point weak inside the congress party, with the ""Syndicate"" (Morarji Desai and Co.) commanding significant power and trying to control her, and the ""Non-syndicate"" younger faction from who she was courting support were mostly socialists  2) There was a backlash against the reforms from various sections, and her performance suffered in the '67 elections as a result.

Good source on Indira Gandhi's financial flip flop from right to left: http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1071&context=political_science_facpub

Rajiv Gandhi too faced a significant backlash, but he only rolled back part of his reforms. He is of course best known for telecom sector reforms. 


The genius of the MMS/Rao team was to get their policies implemented. It seems to me that you are bitter against MMS (I can guess why) but he too deserves a lot of the credit, he wasn't purely a technocrat as he is made out to be.  India was in deep crap in early 90s

Kashmir was in open rebellion.

Punjab was burning

NE was a cauldron of violence and separatists

Babri issue and communal violence was at it's highest

Ltte was trying to rally Tamils in TN against Indian Government

Economy was in ICU

Soviet Union: India's largest backer had collapsed

Pakistan had got support of West as it helped in thwarting Soviets in Afghanistan and also received massive funds from Arabs and China

Massive protests both for and againt Mandal Commission. 

Anti India govt in many neighbours. 

 deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2767  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/84601) The biggest obstacle for him was his own party. Most of the old socialist MPs were deeply suspicious of the PVNR govt. Also, the leaders were really shitty back in the day. Devi Lal, Chautala, Sharad Yadav... yuck.

Its almost a miracle we survived.

But it's really sad both UPA & NDA now don't have the guile to get shit done. A lot of hot air and nothing else. I would really like to read more about Rao and his time in office.

Any good books that speak authoritatively and fairly about him?

**Edit:** Btw, let it be known that PVNR was gult. You're welcome :) Social condition was also tough back then. India was at verge of becoming Pakistan like radical country (thanks to Indian voters back then who did not vote for Hindutvawadis).  Super thanks for this. I had no idea what the political situation was like at that time Since PVN was not from Gandhi political family ,he isn't been given any credit for his work.He actually was the best prime minster India ever had and we would have gotten screwed if he wasn't the PM during those crises.
Also read how he avoided sanction by Un/oic by asking iran's help and sending the foreign minister to deliver the letter to Iranians even though the foreign minister was pretty much on his death bed. Frank underwood of Indian politics. While PVNR was good. I do not think that undermines MMSs work. A good leader helps their exceptional talent shine. But they do need that talent. Biggest example of this is our cricket team. 
Dhoni was great leader but he worked with great team. So was Ganguly. Not taking away their leadership qualities but we cannot undermine work of Kumble, Lakshman, Dravid, Tendulkar.
Everyone should get their share of respect, no use praising one to undermine the other. People tend to think that Modi come at a difficult time should compare the time when PVNR came to power India was a literally a cluster-fuck back then i mean economy was in tatters, Kashmir was facing a worst ever urgency, Punjab was still struggling with militancy, all that Mandal commission Fuckery was very much alive and religious divide was at all time high and he even heading a minority government successfully completed a full 5 year term which is truly a  remarkable thing indeed.  Sometimes you need evil ppl in charge to beat the other evil ppl, you dont send a rat into a snake pit, you send a python. > Chankyan

Is this a Tamil expression or did you mean to write Chanakyan? You missed opposition to reforms within the very divided congress party itself. Also, if he was a gandhi dynasty loyalist why was he treated so unfairly aftermath his death and in the days preceding to it?

He is the hero we needed, not the one we deserved. >So what does the fox do? Again, push it via MMS, and when the shit storm hit, MMS ""offered his resignation"" which the fox graciously refused

Not really. MMS by nature was a sensitive and introverted academic who did not know politics. So each time he introduced a reform and the opposition and critics bayed for his blood, he could not genuinely take it, and offered resignations a total of three times during the period. Only after much persuasion from PVN to not take criticism personally did he start accepting it.  RRC, how the fuck did your piece get construed as a belittling of MMS?

The fuck? Rao was also

* Home Minister during 1984, during which one of the worst riots in modern India happened.
* Coal blocks (India's largest scam to date) from 1993 to 2014 were cancelled by the SC. Which means the coal scam originally started with Rao and was continued by successive governments (including BJP).
* Wanted nuclear tests but was strong armed by US into not doing it which probably set our energy policy back decades and responsible for our energy shortage. Vajpayee actually made this an election issue and rode the nationalism wave on this.

Honestly, I don't see Rao being a better PM than Nehru. Indira Gandhi (and then Rajiv through his incompetence, though his direction was mostly right) fucked up the Indian economy, not Nehru. Nehru's policies were right for the time and we would have been far worse if someone like Bose has been the leader of the country. I'd still place Rao in the top 3 PMs of modern India and MMS and Indira Gandhi at the bottom (discounting short term clusterfuck PMs  such as VP Singh and Gujral) There is a sudden interest in Rao, because of him not being from the Gandhi family and BJP generally wanting to downplay the family.. but the fact of the matter is, we came through this mess because of sheer brilliance of Manmohan Singh. 

My dad was working at a decently senior position at SBI. Everyone was shitting bricks about the impending doom, before Manmohan Singh came up with a credible plan.

And the shit got passed in the parliament, because of the high professional integrity of Manmohan Singh and leaders believed what he said.

MMS might have been a shitty leader, but one of the brilliant economic minds India has ever seen. > JD+CPI held 102 seats, the BJP 120. These two combined alone could defeat any motion.

BJP had some reservations but they were supporting the reforms. OP, I dont know how many of randians has seen days where

1) 2 tv channels (DD and DD 2)

2) getting a mtnl line required waiting

3) you get a passport and the postman will ask for bakshish

4) nationalized bank people treat you like shit. The attitude hasnt changed much on their part. People now hit back.

5) ambassador and fiat cars, hmt watches, air india, indian airlines, custom notified shops (to buy imported stuff)

While we should have gone the market driven model, we went soviet style where everything is controlled by the state. 

That was the 1st biggest mistake no one talks about.

I see Swamy talking about it. Do you have any info on his contributions from sources other than what he says? [removed] And what is your opinion of MMS' role in the liberalisation of the Indian economy? Don't forget - on being made PM, he *chose* to take up the Industrial ministry. He didn't give it to anyone else. Being industrial minister, he could roll out the reforms and didn't need anyone elses stamp or any secretary to pass it to the PMO. :) You missed this!

Didn't include the cases where the tenure was extremely short. 


EDIT: Ugh, missing a word in the title, supposed to have a ""you"" in there. 

",Brownhops," It's very hard to ""rank"" PMs like this, because a ranking suggests a single axis. Most PMs have mixed track records, good in some areas, crap in others. 

Since a lot of posters here are quite young, I'll try to cover some of the older PMs:

 * **Nehru**: [4/10]: His economic theories (Fabian socialism) made India suffer, some of his appointments were disastrous (Krishna Mennon), he was geopolitically naive (Panchsheel, UN security council, Sino-Indian war), his political machinations kept some capable men away from power (Patel). In general, he was indecisive and weak. But OTOH, I have to admit that overall he was better than 99% of the other options at that time - his personal stature imbued the PMO with a sense of dignity, he was pretty good as a figurehead - he could speak well and if he had left governance to the officials and confined himself to the ceremonial role, I think he would have been remembered well.

* **Shastri**: [7/10]: Bit of a surprise package. During his early days in office, he'd kept a pretty low profile, almost like late-term MNS. But he rose to the occasion in 1965, when confronted with Pak's Op Grand Slam.  He authorized the military to open a second front - a decisive move that helped India militarily and restored some of the confidence lost in 1962, both among the services and the civilian population

* **Desai**: [1/10]: Fucking disaster. Disgrace to the office of the PM

* **Charan Singh**: N/A: Nonentity but at least not an idiot like Desai

* **Indira Gandhi**: [6/10]: Probably the most divisive of India's PMs. A lot of people overlook that her two terms were very different - her second term was much more low-profile than the 1st one. But overall, she made many mistakes. The emergency of course, but also her nationalization drive (consummating India's flirtation with socialism started by her dad) and her overt political dealings. (FWIW, I don't think her political machinations were any worse than the others', she just carried them out more openly, and broadened her scope of influence, opening the door to other politicians doing the same). She also handled the Khalistan situation badly - Op Blue Star... well, that was a crying shame. On the flip side, she was the most decisive PM India has had - she knew when to get out of the way and let the professionals do their job. India's profile rose with the Asian games, CHOGM and other events on her watch. Most importantly, she handled 1971 perfectly - a lot of folks don't understand *how* badly it could have ended for India, given the US position and the localized issues in Bangladesh, Punjab and Pakistan. That the country came out on top is nothing short of incredible

* **Rajiv**: [4/10]: Pretty much a nonentity, wasted years for India.

* **VP Singh**: [2/10]: Mandal and other BS

* **Gujral**: [3/10]: Personal probity aside, his Gujral doctrine was a fucking mess. Still, at least he had some ideas, shitty though they were My top 3 in chornological order - ( Shastri had too short a stint to know for sure) 

1- Nehru - Made huge mistakes but setup the way things work in India. We have adjusted some minor things but Indian economy's most important features work the way his team designed- Socialist 5 yr Planning, Non-aligned diplomacy, federal structure where center is all powerful, central institutions of great quality like AIIMS, IIT, IIM 

There is no major change apart from liberalization in 1992 that any PM has done to the precedents laid out by him.

2- PV Narsimha Rao - Gave all of us McDonalds and private sector jobs. Without him liberalizing economy, we would be the at least 20-30% poorer as a nation and individually. 

3-  AB Vajpayee - Made major changes to the way India was conducting diplomacy and re-started the process of structural changes PVNR had brought in.  Was Shastri instrumental in anything other than winning the Pak war. Yes, that is a big one, but I have heard people being so impressed with Lal Bahadur Shastri, that I want to know what else did he do? 1. Indira Gandhi (8/10): Split Pakistan into two pieces...this victory is the greatest Indian victory since the Marathas defeated the Mughals. Also, she convinced the Sikhs that an independent country in northwestern India will not even be discussed.  Can you imagine how horrible it would be to have a country that plays Pak and India against each other and shelters agents from both sides?

2. Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, VP Singh, Chandra Shekar, IK Gujral, HD Deve Gowda (7/10). These prime ministers proved that India was not a Single-Party state. They provided the first viable opposition to Congress and showed that whoever wins an election in India will peacefully take power. Also, these Janata Dal governments were among the first to have leaders from Middle-Caste and Lower-Middle Castes...this integrated these communities into democratic India by assuring them that India belonged to them too. Deve Gowda is especially important because he assured non-Brahmin dravidians that India would not treat them like 2nd Class citizens. 

3. Atal Bihari Vajpayee (6.99/10) for improving the budged deficit, undertaking infrastructure projects and for establishing a permanent and resilient opposition party. 

4. PV Narasimha Rao (6.98/10) for liberalizing the economy. Also he was the first non-Nehru dynasty person to serve a 5 year term. This is why his memory is erased in the Congress party...they don't want to acknowledge that the Congress can thrive without the Family. 

5. Manmohan Singh (4/10). For making India enter into some nice nuclear deals. Also, though he was largely a figurehead, at least he made sure an Italian didn't become PM. It would have been might embarrassing for a country known for anti-imperialism to be ruled voluntarily by a European. I know Sonia largely (but not completely) ran the show behind the scenes but still symbolism is important and I'm glad Manmohan was the PM representing India overseas. 

6. The rest were not really consequential positive or negative. 



 Nehru: 8/10. Passed the Hindu bills in spite of opposition from almost all pro Hindu organizations. If not for him Hindus today would have been in same state as Muslims. His relationship with Edwina Mountbatten helped India a lot in partition. Sure he erred on Kashmir but Kashmir anyway could have gone either ways. He is the reason we have democracy. While almost every post colonial democracy failed, India thrived because of him. He actually believed in democracy. Had he died 5-10 years earlier, India would surely have lapsed into dictatorship. His economic philosophies were alright for his times but were carried on for long because of his family being in power. 

Atal Bihari Vajpayee: 7/10. Mistake on Kargil but India coped well. Went big on infrastructure, the best thing to happen. Very few scams during his time compared to any other PM.

Narsimha Rao: 6/10 Started liberalization and helped India break from stagnation.

Shastri: 5/10 Led India well, clean image. Had promise.

Indira Gandhi: 4/10 Emergency and some extreme socialist decision notwithstanding she did well in operation Bluestar and 71 war.

Rajiv Gandhi/Manmohan Singh: -5/10 Took India years back.

Everyone else: 0 they were just holding onto their chair. Confession: I don't know much about PMs before Rajeev, other than Indira. Hence, my rankings:


1. AB Vajpayee (1999-2004) - True globalization. Stable economy, low inflation. Honorable foreign policy, good handling of Kargil. 

2. PV Narasimha Rao (1991-1996) - Good handling of BoP crisis. Tried to make a break from Gandhi Dynasty.

The rest are worthy of contempt:

Negative 1,000,000 - Indira Gandhi (1966-1984) - Started India's love affair with all that's evil today, from sloth and corruption to ineptitude and greed. India's Hitler and Castro rolled into one. May she rot in hell.

Negative 1000 - Rajiv Gandhi (1984-1989) - Perpetuated Momma's stupidities, fine tuned vote bank politics, first PM level corruption.

Negative 500 - Dr Manmohan Singh (2004-) - Took India from ""growing economy"" to ""stagnated economy"" and now disaster story

Negative 500 - VP Singh (1989-1990) - Mandal Commission, indecisive on key policy points

The rest (post Rajeev) are idiots. 1. Narasimha Rao
2. Vajpayee 


3. Manmohan Singh (UPA 1 only)
4. Lal Bahadur shastri (just for winning the war)
 gujral missing in the list?! Shastri - Best Ever
Indira Gandhi - Strong leader..though misuse of power but stability
AB VP - Nuff Said
Nehru - Guided through nascent democracy years
PV N - Filled the void in bringing open markets
VP - Alternative
RG - Unable to use absolute majority to guide india and set up as a success
MMS - Do I even type
Moraji Desai - Opened can of worms of bad governments
Charan Singh - Why was he PM
Nanda - Filler...served his purpose
Deve Gowda - Classic example of what is wrong with Indian electoral system
Chandra Shekar - If there is a way to make this unhappen, please look into it. ModiAll others I don't know PMs before ABVP, so my order is short:

1. Vajpayee
2. Manmohan Singh

But if I'll have to go by what I've read and heard:

Vajpayee

Nehru*

Narasimha Rao

Indira Gandhi*

* excluding their blunders, which seems to almost nullify and makes them a bad one.

Ones I dislike:

Manmohan Singh

Rajiv Gandhi

Indira Gandhi

Nehru

Yep, they make both of my lists. 1 : modi

2 : ABV

3 : LBS

4 : Nehru

5 : PVNR

Policy/Economy,"Now that Raghuram Rajan is leaving, let's talk about his replacement: The Monetary Policy Committee",155,4osapv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4osapv/now_that_raghuram_rajan_is_leaving_lets_talk/,40,"#Exit Raghuram Rajan, Enter Monetary Policy Committee

Now that Raghuram Rajan has resigned, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) of his own free will of course ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), it’s time to talk about his successor: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). You heard that right, a whole committee is set to replace him soon enough.

The media, at the moment, is filled with people sitting in two camps. One is mourning the loss of a great visionary central banker who was putting the ‘[sex back in the sensex](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-09-13/news/42041678_1_raghuram-rajan-rbi-guv-duvvuri-subbarao)’, while the other is excitedly discussing who is going to replace Rajan. 

> “Is it going to be Subramanian Swamy? That wily little fox has been planning it all along!”

> “Is it going to be Pahlaj Nihlani? He makes so many interesting cuts, probably he’ll be good at cutting interests too!”

> “Is it going to be Arundhati Bhattacharya? The first *woman* RBI chairman! That would sell, boyz, that would sell well indeed!”

> “Is it going to be Tanmay Bhat? He can then announce interest rate cuts over Snapchat. He’ll snap the economy in the Bhat and bring it back to shape!”

But what our dear media and ‘experts’ don’t seem to be talking about is the real replacement, the change of epic proportions that is going to happen to our central bank. So I present to you, the **Monetary Policy Committee**.

Don’t take *my* word for how important this is. RR makes a sly mention to this & the NPA problem in his [farewell letter](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=37259) too. All in one breath, squeezed between cryptic messages of being ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) forced to resign ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) as Governor of RBI.

> Inflation is in the target zone, **but the monetary policy committee that will set policy has yet to be formed**. Moreover, the bank clean up initiated under **the Asset Quality Review**, having already brought more credibility to bank balance sheets, **is still ongoing**. International developments also pose some risks in the short term.

___
#OK. RR is sexy and all. But n00b question: *What* does an RBI Governor do exactly?
___

Before we start talking about the big change, we should talk a little about what the job of the Reserve Bank of India Governor is. It would make it easier to explain the transition from Governor to MPC.

*(Check out /u/ribiy's comment: https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4osapv/now_that_raghuram_rajan_is_leaving_lets_talk/d4f7ll5. He explains this part more lucidly.)*

Think of the RBI as a big bank that lends to other smaller banks, those banks in turn lend to you. Commercial Banks *also* get their own money (through deposits) etc and then lend it to people (Thank you /u/MyselfWalrus). The Governor takes a call on what interest rate the RBI will charge to the banks they are lending to. In turn, those banks would add a tiny percentage of their own to that interest and give loans to people like you & me. The difference of interest rates between deposits & lending is where the banks make the profits, the central bank keeps control over how cheap or expensive loans in the market will be. The governor also sets the *Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)* for banks. That’s basically the amount of securities (Gold, bonds, assets) banks need to have to disburse loans of a proportional amount.

Apart from setting interest rates, he also is a sort of a Bank Manager. He keeps the machine running smoothly, so to speak. He also decides how much money is to be printed in what denominations. The Governor also gets to put his supercool signature on currency notes. He makes sure the cheques get cleared, fair exchange of funds happens between banks and basically keeps a watch on the banking sector through regular audits. 

The Governor is incharge of maintaining order in the foreign exchange market and making sure the country is working towards the goals set by the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). He also has the power to issue directions to banks, the recent one where he ordered a cleanup of balance sheets and declare Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). This is the **Asset Quality Review** that he mentioned in his farethewell letter as well. (Details about the NPA problem can be [read here](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/we-need-to-talk-about-our-banks))

Basically, the RBI governor gets to control how much money is floating around in the market. By increasing/decreasing interest rates, he can control spending within the market and feel like a finance god. The one single job of the RBI Governor over the past few years is to resist the pressure of successive governments & reduce interest rates too much. 

Or, at least, that is the part of his job that gets him in the news.

___
#OK. So the RBI Governor is an epic Finance God that gets to screw the government over, right? RIGHT?
___
Hey now! That’s harsh!

The Governor actually has a job of ensuring economic stability. He/she (‘she’ because now that’s possible!) is supposed to think long-term, ensure that the citizens don’t go on an insane spending spree and create artificial financial bubbles that will burst later and bite ‘em in the a. (Eg: The 2008 Housing Mortgage crisis in the US)

The Government, on the other hand, is a creature with a life of 5 years. In those five years, they are desperately trying to woo the voters and get them to vote for the same political party in the next election. What would make people happier than having more money to spend, ergo cheaper and more accessible loans! 

The government of the day will keep asking the RBI Governor to lower interest rates so that there is more money flooded in the market (""Bubbles? What bubbles? We'll deal with them *if* they burst""). The RBI Governor refuses most of the time because propping up an economy on the shoulders of a creature called ‘debt’ is… well… a TERRIBLE idea.

*Well, whatdoyaknow, that’s all about to change!*

___
#Alrighty then! Tell me about the big ‘change’.
___
[The Finance Bill, 2016](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2016-17/fb/bill.pdf), which was passed in the last budget session of Parliament, had a [controversial amendment to the FCRA act \(Clause 233\)](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/last-week-in-parliament) that allowed foreign funding to political parties. But but but, it had another amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act (Clauses 216 to 220), which created this entity called the “Monetary Policy Committee”.

Earlier, the Governor was the whole & sole authority to decide interest rates. He could veto anything that he thought doesn’t benefit the Indian economy. It was a dictatorship and there was no way around it. Now, the MPC will be the one setting rates and making fiscal policies for the country.

The MPC will have six members, three from the RBI and three ‘eminent personalities’ appointed by the central government. The RBI peeps will consist of the Governor (Chairman), Deputy Governor & one officer nominated by the RBI central board. The 3 ‘personalities’ will be selected for a period of four years by [the following people](http://imgur.com/2ZTbQRm). 

Each member gets one vote. If there is a tie, [the RBI Governor gets the casting vote](http://imgur.com/xJT8Hi8).

Every member has to give a written statement explaining why they voted in favour/against a resolution. However, all proceedings of the Monetary Policy Committee [shall remain confidential](http://imgur.com/NtBtUkW).

These are the *bare bone facts* that I have presented to you. You can interpret it in whatever way you want. I am going to go ahead and give my take on it.

____
#Democratic way of functioning
___

Most global banks have this process of having a committee to decide rate and monetary policies. In the US, the Federal Open Market Committee has seven board members, all of whom are appointed by the President for a period of 14 years. In England, the MPC has nine members (5 from the Bank of England and 4 appointed by the Minister of Finance).

In India, the debate for forming an MPC began in February 2014. The RBI, back then, recommended that this committee should have Five members (Three from RBI and Two Government appointed). In 2015, the Government recommended that the committee should have Seven members (Four Govt. appointed and Three from the RBI). After much haggling and powerplay, they seem to have reached a compromise with equal number of members from both sides. 

Jaitley mentioned in the Lok Sabha during the Finance Bill 2016 debate that this MPC was formed in consultation with the RBI, so itsallgood. 

**Or is it?**

Earlier the Governor was incharge of making the right call. He was solely responsible for any bad decisions that he takes and the economy suffers as a result. So it also meant that the Governor was that much careful before lowering interest rates or taking any major steps. Now, there’s a committee in place, the responsibility of the decisions taken would be *diluted* between six people. ([Shared Responsibility](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/))

Let’s assume a scenario where there is a resolution in place to lower the interest rate. Three people (government appointees) vote in favour and the other three (RBI appointees including the Governor) vote against. It's a tie. Now the governor gets a casting vote. Logically, the governor would vote against, keeping in line with his first vote.

But what if he/she decides to vote in favour? What would that exactly mean, in terms of attributing responsibility for making bad decisions? There is always the factor that the new governor would be someone who totally favors the Government and takes decisions based on only their recommendations. 

Or worse, takes decisions to *be in the favour* of the Government.

EDIT: Corrections as suggested by /u/myselfwalrus

EDIT2: Added /r/ribiy's comment to the Original post.

EDIT3: /u/ngotha made [some valid points](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4osapv/now_that_raghuram_rajan_is_leaving_lets_talk/d4f8y1s). Adding a summation:

- RR was in favour of the MPC model. What he wasn't in favour was the composition of the committee. (/u/DARKKKKIS [gave a link](http://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-very-happy-with-composition-of-monetary-policy-committee/articleshow/51372691.cms) for the same)

- The composition has since been changed to the present version.

- You can't have a Nihlani or Sharma as the govt nominees because the Committee also mentions the selection process for these people. It will be done by an external panel which includes the RBI Governor.",kumbhakaran," 3-3 is only a theoretical balance. It will never happen in practice. Deputy-Governer will never disagree with government's line since his likely promotion depends on Government's grace. I expect RBI to become a total rubber stamp. Governer will become a scape-goat if anything bad happenes. You miss out a couple of points or at least it's very misleading. 

The MPC is not a replacement for the RBI governor, the MPC would help set  iinterest rates (which as you briefly mentioned, is how a lot of the central banks around the world function), but the RBI has quite a few other tasks to perform. 

Second, you make no mention that the greatest Indian since Buddha, RR was in favour of the MPC model, someone has even posted links here which you might want to peruse. What he wasn't in favour was the composition of the committee, which has since gone through a change to his satisfaction. 

 Here is the fun part, the idea of an MPC came not from the dictatorial Modiji govt but from a UPA appointed technocrat named Urjit Patel, the deputy governor (Oxford, Yale, London Uni, IMF alumnus, so maybe not as talented as the greatest Indian since Buddha, but reasonably so), you can find a copy of his findings [here](https://m.rbi.org.in//Scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?ID=743). 

So the summary is, a UPA appointed the Deputy Governor and the governor who formed a committee to look at reform in the RBI who inturn suggested the MPC, which is not a replacement for the greatest Indian since Buddha. Also you can't have a Nihlani or Sharma as the govt nominees because the Committee also has mentioned the selection process for these people and one is that it us by an external panel which incidentally has the Governor in it. 

It might be more accurate if your post reflects some of these points.  Rajan has heavily favoured MPC. 

http://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-very-happy-with-composition-of-monetary-policy-committee/articleshow/51372691.cms He has not resigned from his post. He is still the RBI Governor till his term ends in September, he has decided against seeking a second term. Also the MPC is not a replacement to the RBI governor. The MPC will decide the monetary policy and the RBI governor is a member of the committee with a casting vote. 

The RBI also doesn't lend to banks for further lending, the banks are supposed to raise their own funds through deposits/loans/bonds. The RBI only lend short-term for banks to meet their statutory requirements (CRR, SLR). They also provide funds for upto 180 days against promissory notes issued by banks for loans against export bills. quality post 
 hey man, thanks for this. As someone who doesn't watch TV(and by that extension news) and doesn't follow any news in general(hate news), I rarely have idea about what happens when and where, especially regarding policy changes and other stuff in India. Thanks for the write-ups about these stuff, really appreciate it. Don't worry, you are not the only source of my info about these stuff, I do read up elsewhere on it on my own, to have an unbiased opinion.  >Or worse, takes decisions to be in the favour of the Government.

It's pretty obvious, they're gonna find someone who they can use as a stooge or atleast shares the same views on economic policies as they do. SriSri would make a good candidate i suppose.

This is absolutely misleading. For the most part, Banks get their own money (through deposits) etc and then lend it to people like you and me.

**Central bank liquidity withdrawal: Short-term uncertainty can be long-term opportunity** 

 ______ 
Recently, we have seen huge sell-off in the global bond market as nervousness deepened that central banks are moving toward reducing stimulus efforts that have supported debt markets Almost all the central banks be it the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, the Bank of England or the Bank of Canada, each one is preparing the markets for a gradual withdrawal from accommodative monetary policies.The global economy is experiencing synchronous growth, labor markets are improving and consumer spending and business investment have picked up. However inflation is running below central banks’ targets. The recent data on inflation shows that there is a pickup in inflation but it still remains below desired levels in most developed economies.The minutes of the US Federal Open Market Committee’s June policy discussions shower a split over inflation. Minutes from the ECB released indicated that the ECB was worried about how best to communicate increasing confidence in the eurozone economy without roiling market. The news of shifting monetary policy trajectories of central banks have led to the volatility in both stock market and Forex market.The Bank of Japan and the European Central banks are scheduled to meet on July 20 and Fed interest rates decision is scheduled on July 26. Though Fed Chair Yellen has said that the US economy is healthy enough for the Fed to proceed with plans to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, but it is expected that Fed would slow the pace of rate hikes down the road and interest rates would remain historically low over the longer term.Emerging economies including India have undoubtedly been benefited from the environment of lower interest rates.Among all major economies, the interest rate regime in India only is on a downward trajectory.Meanwhile, recent data pointed to slowing industrial production growth and to a falling retail price inflation has given room to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to resort to accommodative stance from neutral at the review meeting on August 2.The markets know that the long period of low rates has to end sometime and a gradual normalisation of policy rates may not necessarily impact the stock markets. However, a sudden change in yield expectations may cause volatility in the market. As the fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong, any inorderly tapering by the major central bankers would have limited impact on the Indian stock market.So, it is advised to use any dip into the market as buying opportunity and remain invested for long term as India is a bright spot among its peer though its valuation looks rich.

chill. this is not how tax on trading works. you are only taxed on your profits.

if you're so worried, get a CA from cleartax.in to give you a call. it's only like Rs.500  1. are you filing regular return ?

if yes then

2. you had shown assets in balance sheet?

if yes then

3. did your assets ""were"" more than the amount of money you invested ?

if yes then

4. are you liable for tax audit ?
 if yes then


you are safe bhai!!!

if answer is no to any question 

still dont worry just wait for the IT NOTICE. They will just ask you to pay the tax amount plus some interest at the time of assessment plus penalty( only if the amount invested is from undisclosed income)

At last just make  sure to pay tax at the time of filing return for a safer side.

 Tax is usually on profits, not turnover. So if you are that scared pay capital gains tax on your profits.",2017-12-19 01:39:32

What the hell kinda car does the reporter drive? Kant pointed to a number of policy decisions that have already been taken in this regard. These include 

* further freeing up the foreign direct investment ( FDI) regime, 

* bringing consistency and predictability to tax policy and 

* pushing hard on infrastructure projects, particularly in roads and railways. 
 Indications of a mining sector reboot suggest that the govt's attempts to revive the economy through reforms and higher public capital.

---

> * NEW DELHI: India's economy may be about to turn the corner on the back of robust public spending that's beginning to have an impact on the ground coupled with strong urban consumer demand, economists and government officials said.Three months of sound industrial growth driven by manufacturing, signs of a pickup in investment, robust indirect tax collections and indications of a mining sector reboot suggest that the government's attempts to revive the economy through reforms and higher public capital spend are working.Going ahead, the tailwinds of falling interest rates, big foreign inflows and a further strengthening of consumer demand in anticipation of the Seventh Pay Commission's award should propel the economy forward, said the analysts and officials.

> * ""The key challenge was liquidity, particularly in the infra sector and the government has done its bit by boosting capital expenditure in roads and railways,"" said Kant, who has been spearheading the Centre's initiative to make doing business in the country easier as well as the Make in India campaign, resulting in the increased flow of foreign investment.The government has sought to press ahead with policy changes despite resistance from the opposition on some key changes.

> * In this slow pace, most of the data will not look positive; there could be ups and down,"" said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, India Ratings & Research.

> * ""The likely stimulus from the upcoming Seventh Pay Commission, further monetary easing of 25-50 basis points, the thrust on public investments coupled with structural reforms such as the goods and services tax (GST) and ease of doing business are likely to aid the process of recovery, said Citigroup's Anurag Jha in a note.

Policy/Economy,"Hi/r/India, I am Govindraj of IndiaSpend along with Samar, Ask Us Anything",54,50sr6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/50sr6k/hirindia_i_am_govindraj_of_indiaspend_along_with/,46,"Edit: Logging off now, will answer more questions, if any, on Saturday morning.

About IndiaSpend:

IndiaSpend is the country’s first data journalism initiative. We use data to tell stories with the broader objective of improving the quality of public discourse. IndiaSpend was founded in late 2011 by Govindraj Ethiraj. IndiaSpend is increasingly an `agency of record’ when it comes to data and facts on the Indian economy, particularly in areas like education, healthcare, environment, energy and gender.

IndiaSpend is a non-profit and a project of The Spending & Policy Research Foundation located in Lower Parel in Mumbai, and registered as a Charitable Trust with the Charity Commissioner, Mumbai. 

Govindraj Ethiraj, Founder: He is a television & print journalist and also Founder of PING Digital Network, a next generation digital television initiative. He also anchors seasonal shows on Indian news television – the current one being the weekly `Policy Watch’ on public service broadcaster Rajya Sabha or RS TV. And most recent being BottomLine on Headlines Today – and writes for newspapers like Business Standard.

Previously, he was Founder-Editor in Chief of Bloomberg TV India. Prior to setting up Bloomberg TV India, he worked with Business Standard newspaper as Editor (New Media) with a specific mandate of integrating the newspaper’s news operations with its digital or web platform. He also spent around five years each with CNBC-TV18 & The Economic Times. He is a Fellow of The Aspen Institute, Colorado & a winner of the BMW Foundation Responsible Leadership Awards for 2014.

Samar Halarnkar, Editor: A journalist for 24 years working at publications like the Indian Express and India Today. His last assignment was Managing Editor of Hindustan Times, where he revamped the nationwide flow of news to focus on issues of public interest and ran groundbreaking investigations into poverty related multibillion-dollar subsidy programmes and administrative reform.

He continues as a columnist with Hindustan Times and Mint, writing on social and economic issues, science and technology. Most recently, he was a fellow with the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University, where he drew up a blueprint for mobile-phone-based, public-interest journalism model for India. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of California-Berkeley.

Halarnkar is the author of two books, “Nirvana under the rain tree”, an early chronicle of India’s Internet Revolution, and “A married man’s guide to creative cooking (and other dubious adventures)”, his experiments with cooking, which flowed out of a popular cooking column that he continues to write. He is married with a four-year-old daughter and lives in Bangalore.

",govindrajethiraj," Hi Govindraj and Samar. Thanks for doing this. 

I wanted to ask about this particular story IndiaSpend did on Delhi pollution which appeared in HT - [""Delhi’s pollution one-and-half times worse than Beijing""](http://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-pollution-one-and-half-times-worse-than-beijing/story-zGXWaA0sMG3nwTEeU59SaP.html). Apparently it was based on ONE data point in Delhi and ONE data point in Beijing.

> The analysis is based on a comparison of data generated by IndiaSpend’s #Breathe air quality monitoring sensor placed at RK Puram, Delhi with the one placed by the US government in its embassy at Beijing.

Don't you think the data analysis here is incomplete, and the headline is ""flawed"". The same flawed analysis was [picked up](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/beijing-pollution-smog-air-quality-environment-delhi-india-china-a6768611.html) by The Independent among others. [deleted] From painful experience - quality data sets on india are hard to come by. How (if at all) does this impact your work and what steps do you take to combat it.

Doesn't this limit the scope of DJ ?

What do you use/how do you guys clean and prep your data? Thank you all for your insightful questions and encouraging feedback...we will answer any further questions tomorrow morning by 10:00 AM IST [deleted] Hello! Thanks for doing this AMA  
1. What is one biggest misconception that you cleared, that you think is the most significant/interesting  
2.  What do you think of the current GDP calculation exercise?  
3. Do you have any suggestion to improve the way elections are reported and analysed?  
4. Which is the one area (in India ) where data journalism is needed the most?   
 Welcome! 

I'm sorry I can't articulate this question very well and I might be getting it all wrong, but - In your opinion in general, do you find that Indian systems of business commentary/think tanks/political commentary have started closely mirroring US structures? for eg. we see in US think tanks funded by special interest groups or with specific conservative or corporatist bents that produce analysis to the advantage of certain interests. do you see that happening in India too? Props for the #Breath initiative to monitor pollution levels in the country, its what inspired me and a friend to make [Earth Map](http://ocsidlab.github.io/earthmap/#4/21.15/79.08) on world environment day. Was very impressed to find open data and well documented APIs for this data. IndiaSpend is an awesome initiative! I hope other newspapers also follow the suit and do more data journalism. I do have some questions:

1) If I want to do data journalism, what is the path that you recommend, considering that I don't have any background in journalism, but I do work in the data analytics area.

2) Do you accept outside contributions for articles? Obviously after editorial review.

3) What tools do you guys use internally to do analysis?

4) Do you guys do any follow up research on the articles that you publish, and do some academic publishing?

5) Do you always use publicly available data sources like data.gov.in, or do you guys also file RTI requests?

Thanks for doing this, and in general for India Spend. Do you find any particular areas/sectors, in which getting relevant data is particularly hard? Really love IndiaSpend,

I really don't like the Indian Media as it is today, more sensationalism than substance, giving wide coverage to things that are not at all of national importance.

Indian Media should not be like 1st world country Media, because India is not 1st world country. Their priorities are different, while India faces massive 3rd world problems like Poverty, illiteracy, Malnutrition, quality Education, Urbanization etc., on a scale like no other country. Why does Mainstream Media cover Business so little when India is rapidly becoming a Market Economy.

Should media hold accountable on Policy issues with respective ministers and state Govt's rather than tit-for-tat silly politics, should Media work in nationalist interest because India faces such grave problems. what's your take on Media coverage of issues that's really matter. Are you hiring? Why is it named IndiaSpend? First of all thanks for doing this. I've read many of your pieces over the years and your data driven approach to journalism is quite refreshing in the present landscape. 

I have a few questions:

1. I'll be very honest. Most India spend articles I read are on other sites like Scroll etc. And I'm guessing they pick up stories which their editorial team thinks is the most relevant to their readers. Does cross publishing help readers discover your platform or is it harmful to the bottomline?


2. How difficult is it in our country to reach the masses with a purely data driven approach to journalism? Do you deliberately attempt to ""dumb down"" jargon or is that a strict no-no?


3. The risk with any data is that it can be interpreted variously by different people. Is it therefore difficult to maintain objectivity regarding conclusions you draw from data and how do you make sure that you stay away from ""I'm seeing what I want to see in the data"" kind of reportage? Really appreciate your efforts to clear up the ambiguity about lot of issues impacting us. 

1. What are some constructive ways your data has been used in?

2. What data surprised you the most and shattered common perceptions in that area? 


 First of all thanks for the wonderful initiative. I have 3 questions.  
1. How difficult to get right data as our system is not much supportive in collecting data ? What is the most difficult part ?  
2. How difficult is to remain unbiased while reporting issues ?  
3. Any particular case where the data based journalism has made major impact ?   I really have nothing worthwhile to ask at the moment(lots of good suggestions and questions already here) but i just want to say, *Thank You Guys* for what you are doing. Its appreciated immensely.  
We need this type of Facts-Only media journalism.  
Unfortunately we live in a world of Narrative/Story-based media journalism era, which is inherently prone to bias by its very design.  

I hope you set up a plan to safeguard your future revenue streams because being donations driven doesn't seem like a future proof plan to me. I hope you guys can sort this vulnerability in your project.  

All the best.  [removed]",2016-09-02 19:30:00
Policy/Economy,Mohan Bhagwat's Vijay Dashami Speech [R],63,2i69rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2i69rn/mohan_bhagwats_vijay_dashami_speech_r/,277,"The full speech is available here: http://samvada.org/2014/news/full-text-of-speech-by-rss-sarasanghchalak-mohan-bhagwat-on-vijaya-dashmi-2014-nagpur/

I read through the entire speech and would like to go through it point by point

>Today we see that even when the issue of ecology is being discussed in details for past many decades, **yet we find that with each passing day the ecological destruction is approaching much faster and closer to us.** Because of this environmental destruction, the world is facing newer and deadlier natural calamities consistently. But except for some changes in their vocabulary or some half hearted attempts at symptomatic treatment, no meaningful change is visible in the policies of nations and large multinational companies.

Good, raises the issue of environmental conversation. As we have seen in Uttarakhand, Pune Landslide and several other natural calamities, damaging the environment can be catastrophic. Hopefully, the government is listening. I am worried because it doesn't seem to be listening. Context: http://qz.com/255772/the-11-environmental-disasters-narendra-modi-blessed-in-his-first-100-days/

>In the history of past one thousand years, Bharat has been the only example which has made genuine efforts in this direction through the path of truth and non-violence. ... Neither any questions are raised against one’s faith being different, **nor campaigns are run to destroy other idols of worship**, **nor there is a tradition of raising disputes over the validity or respectability of other’s faith on the basis of systems restricted by the dictates of a book.**

Really? Babri, Kandhamahal happened in Pakistan? Furthermore, his arguments are directed towards Abrahamic religions since they follow a central book. However, the Dharmic religions in India are not immune from religious dogmatism.

>With similar expectations in mind, few months ago, the people of Bharat brought about a drastic change in the government. **This change of government is not even six months old. But positive signs are emanating from time to time** which give hope about emergence of Bharat on the international horizon and it appears that the people’s desire of a life, secure and progressing in all its aspects, will soon start reflecting in the governance. In a very short period, some policy initiatives taken by the central government in national interest on the fronts of economy, national security, international relations and many other areas have raised good hopes.

I was told that this was a non-political event. Why he is praising the BJP government here? 

>The new policy makers should also take best advantage of the vision and experience of **great Bharatiya leaders** right from the tradition of Swamy Vivekananda, Yogi Arvind, Swamy Ramtirth, Gurudev Ravindra Nath Thakur and Lokmanya Tilak to Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Swatantrya Veer Savarkar, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, Second Sarsanghachalak of RSS Shri ‘Guruji’ aka Madhav Sadashiv Golvalkar,  Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, Jayprakash Narayan and Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay. 

Notice how not even a single Muslim is named. How about people like Abdul Kalam Azad? Again ties in with their ideology. 

>There is a serious **upsurge in the jehadi activities in the southern parts of Bharat**, especially in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. No effective policy imperatives, efforts are visible in curbing such activities. ... Near surrender before these fanatic elements and appeasement policy adopted by the ruling parties in these states, **have put the life of local Hindu communities, the law and order situation as well as the national security under serious threat in the region**. 

Really, the Hindus and their way of life is under threat in Tamil Nadu and Kerala? Or does the RSS chief subtly want to hint at the rising Muslim population in these states and and wants to tie that to rising terrorism in the state. 

>Though an alert, transparent, sensitive and a rule abiding administration is necessary for ending exploitation and ensuring development, equally important is the role of society in eradicating exploitation of the poor through active cooperation, striving in a democratic way to end their exploitation and by running various types of help and support activities in order to take these fruits of development to the deprived people. **We feel it necessary to put a ban on meat exports, beef in particular and cow smuggling in immediate future.**

I was completely with him till the last sentence. How is a ban on meat exports, **beef in particular**, going to help the poor in India? Will it not just eradicate one source of income? 

>Each one of us must test each of our act, whether big or small, on the simple ground that each member of **my great Hindu society**, and each son/daughter of Mother Bharat, is my own brother and sister. We must ensure that **each of our Hindu temple, cremation ground and community water source must remain open to all Hindus**. We should ensure that all Hindus should participate in all functions, celebrations as well as festivals of great heroes and personalities.

So much for the RSS being a national entity, or are non-Hindus anti-national?

>Since its inception, Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh has been engaged in the great mission of building a work force of such swayamsewaks, who are energized with the **pride of their national Hindu identity**; are empowered by inculcating great qualities in their personality; and are prepared to sacrifice everything even their life for the great goal as a constituent of dedicated and disciplined organisation.

Just a little more Hindutva.

The entire speech is very political in nature, it has nothing to do with Vijay Dashami. He is pushing for an India that reflects the RSS' vision, and I find that deeply disturbing. 

 >“BHARAT MATA KI JAI”

That I wholeheartedly agree with, Bharat Mata ki Jai. :)",once_upon_raconteur," Here is an Hindu organization, addressing Hindus on the eve of a Hindu festival, reminding them Hindu traditions, addressing certain supposed Hindu concerns, extolling them to act based on Hindu values and take pride in their Hindu identity. I do not see what is wrong in that.

Now you may argue that what gives them the right to speak for Hindus, but I do not see that being the tone of this speech at least. He is not speaking to nation, or other religious communities in our country, instructing them to do this or that; he just reached out to Hindus in this country. And I think that is totally fine in a democracy. The same way I would not expect Maulvis or Fathers to speak on universal religious concerns.

My only concern (and I know its being discussed on other threads is) why would the national broadcaster telecast this. People might say - oh well they show the Pope, yada yada - but if we really believe secularism is a bastardised word in this country and its true meaning is that state is neutral towards religion, we might as well show the honesty of our belief and act accordingly.  >Really? Babri, Kandhamahal happened in Pakistan? Furthermore, his arguments are directed towards Abrahamic religions since they follow a central book. However, the Dharmic religions in India are not immune from religious dogmatism.

Source: http://www.niticentral.com/2014/10/03/ramachandra-guhas-hypocrisy-doordarshan-239880.html 1.He's more or less right Babri is minor event compared to thousands of years in India. If you compare that to idiots like Ghazni, Babur, Timur and so many other Islamic invaders what is Babri Masjid its not even a drop in the ocean. Not justifying it but its BS to equate such a small event to larger context .

2.  Love jihad wasn't even brought up by the RSS way back in the early 2000s  it was a problem in Kerala thats where it started and a lot of non RSS entities were complaining about its not fiction like you would like to believe and its a very real problem . And a lot of it includes subversion kidnapping etc.

3. I rather we not kill cows and sell them off as beef primarily because most of those killed are milk producing cattle. Its retarded to kill it and mass grow cattle for consumption considering its very environmentally heavy industry somethign India doesn't have the resources to afford. There is already a shortage of milk because of these morons.

Also whole idea is short sighted and stupid. Take some time to read UN report on climate change. The cattle industry has caused unprecedented droughts and floods in Australia. 80% of Amazon was chopped down for cattle farming.

Its better to use it milk which is holistic its an unsustainble source of income and it causes far more problems than solves .

4. What the hell why are you getting your panties in a bunch about the Hindu cremation grounds? He never said we should ban others and secondly have some respect to something thats sacred to a community it not your holiday picnic. You come across as a brat. What's striking for me

> There is an urgent need to take up eradication of social discrimination in our society in a bigger and faster way. No government or administrative machinery has the powers to remove feeling of discrimination from people’s mind. It will end only with the efforts and initiative of society itself. This can start only by direct action at the level of our mind, our family and friends. To do this, we will have to remove all such habits, misbelieves, traditions and practices which encourage such discrimination. We will have to drive out even the smallest of the remnants of our caste based, regional and linguistic egos which breed such prejudices. We will have to stop ourselves from even listening to or speaking such provocative statements which encourage such prejudices in our hearts. We must also stop ourselves from participating in any such violent activity that arises from such provocative speech and environment. Each one of us must test each of our act, whether big or small, on the simple ground that each member of my great Hindu society, and each son/daughter of Mother Bharat, is my own brother and sister. We must ensure that each of our Hindu temple, cremation ground and community water source must remain open to all Hindus. We should ensure that all Hindus should participate in all functions, celebrations as well as festivals of great heroes and personalities.

This is by far the most brutal assessment of the ""hindu"" society by ANY leader. He simply says if hindus themselves have to overcome the discrimination meted out to sections in Hindu society.

Also, was in a way hoping to compare (alleged) remote controls of the two (alleged) biggest parties in our democracy.

But I came away disappointed because the former was too political, and the latter was well, just too long. >We will have to drive out even the smallest of the remnants of our caste based, regional and linguistic egos which breed such prejudices. We will have to stop ourselves from even listening to or speaking such provocative statements which encourage such prejudices in our hearts. We must also stop ourselves from participating in any such violent activity that arises from such provocative speech and environment.

Think before you act. Dharma ke naam me adharma na karo. If only. > Notice how not even a single Muslim is named. How about people like Abdul Kalam Azad? Again ties in with their ideology.

In Shaakhas if you mention this name when you asked to write list of freedom fighters, you would be politely taught not to do such mistake again  I honestly believe religion is a major factor holding us back, for us to mold ourselves into an egalitarian society we must stop discriminating. Religion should be limited our four walls, we waste to much time talking/debating/fighting/killing over something i believe is  imaginary. Although religion has some ethics, morality and values ingrained in them, a majority of persons practicing their religion completely miss the point, and instead rely on rituals and chanting in hope to get material gains.
In response to DD covering a Mohan bhagwats speech, we live in a democracy and in essence all sections of society should be represented equally whether its the Dalits, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, etc should be give an opportunity to speak and i am sure they have been given air time and i'm sure people have raised objections to them as well. Our society needs to grow and should focus on how we can help each other out instead raising petty issues and dividing people. > Really? Babri, Kandhamahal happened in Pakistan? Furthermore, his arguments are directed towards Abrahamic religions since they follow a central book. However, the Dharmic religions in India are not immune from religious dogmatism.

If you go in History there was no namaaz offered in Babri for years it was just a structure standing . So pointing out Hindus don't point out or ask the validity of one's faith means he's targeting Abrahamic religions wow . Nobody is immune to bad things it's when those very things become your ideology it becomes a matter of concern .

> Notice how not even a single Muslim is named. How about people like Abdul Kalam Azad? Again ties in with their ideology.

He didn't even mention any sikh but you care only about Muslims shows how secular you are ? /s

> Really, the Hindus and their way of life is under threat in Tamil Nadu and Kerala? Or does the RSS chief subtly want to hint at the rising Muslim population in these states and and wants to tie that to rising terrorism in the state.

So you mean Jehadi activity is directly related to increasing muslim population ?

> I was completely with him till the last sentence. How is a ban on meat exports, beef in particular, going to help the poor in India? Will it not just eradicate one source of income?

Beef is an environmental threat and not viable and the exported one doesn't even give protein to our people . Most of the exported beef is processed by machines so very little poor work there . I don't think you have seen a real slaughter house .

> So much for the RSS being a national entity, or are non-Hindus anti-national?

So teaching hindus to abolish bad practices such as casteism  directly becomes sectarian ? 

> The entire speech is very political in nature, it has nothing to do with Vijay Dashami. He is pushing for an India that reflects the RSS' vision, and I find that deeply disturbing.

I find your vision of censorship deeply disturbing .

> That I wholeheartedly agree with, Bharat Mata ki Jai. :)

Thank you , Bharat Mata ki jai :)


 >the Hindus and their way of life is under threat in Tamil Nadu and Kerala? Or does the RSS chief subtly want to hint at the rising Muslim population in these states and and wants to tie that to rising terrorism in the state. 

Don't you read the stories how RSS workers have been killed by commies and Jihadis in TN and Kerala or you are myopic or ignorant.  RSS' website [says this about who can join the Parent organization](http://www.rss.org//Encyc/2012/10/23/Basic-FAQ-on-RSS.aspx) 

> **Who can become a member of RSS?**

> Any Hindu male can become member of RSS.

**Modi government: The next two years** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government completed three years in office last week. Any assessment of its economic performance should take into account what it inherited. India faced a near-crisis situation in 2013. Inflation had spun out of control. Public finances were a mess. The rupee was in free fall. Confidence was low owing to corruption scandals and economic mismanagement by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in the years leading to the 2014 general election.

India has come a long way since then. The most important economic policy achievement of the past three years has been macroeconomic stability. Inflation is now under control. There has been a tentative recovery in economic growth. The balance of payments is comfortable. Part of this can be explained by the steep decline in global energy prices, but the retreat from loose monetary and fiscal policies has also been an important reason why the Indian economy is no longer fragile.

The reforms record has been a more mixed one—especially since Modi spoke on the campaign trail about minimum government and maximum governance.

The Modi government should be satisfied that the stage is now set for the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST). Even the flawed GST we are beginning with will boost overall efficiency in the economy. India now has a new monetary policy framework. The passage of the bankruptcy code will lead to more efficient allocation of capital. However, these policy initiatives were inherited from the UPA regime. The Modi government needs to now craft its own reforms playbook for the next decade.

There have been some important initiatives. A new fiscal framework is in the works. High-level corruption has almost disappeared. The auction of natural resources has been done in a transparent manner. The government has also taken a number of steps to check the flow of black money. However, the most radical move made by the Modi government was the withdrawal of high-value banknotes in November 2016. The benefits of the move are not yet clear, and will only be known in the years ahead.

The government has managed to bring down the fiscal deficit while increasing capital expenditure. A recent report by Deutsche Bank showed that government expenditure led by capital expenditure increased in the last two years of the term of every government since 1991, with the exception of UPA-II, when expenditure went up in the last year. However, barring UPA-I, higher expenditure did not result in a corresponding increase in the fiscal deficit. It will be important for the Modi government to stick to the stated fiscal path, and not indulge in a spending spree like the UPA, as it could compromise the hard-won macroeconomic stability.

Along with maintaining fiscal discipline, the government will have to continue to work in areas that are holding back the economy. One of the reasons why growth has remained subdued in the last few years is the collapse in private sector investment. Policymakers have not been able to solve the twin balance sheet problem. A coherent strategy to clean up banks is still not in evidence. Privatization of public sector banks should be seriously considered.

Also, all efforts should be made to strengthen the corporate bond market in order to channelize long-term finance for Indian companies. This will also help boost activity in the infrastructure sector where private sector investment has been missing, partly because of the reluctance of banks to lend. An investment revival is critical for higher growth.

The government should now work on the next level of reforms. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government managed to do a lot of things in the latter half of its tenure. For instance, the fiscal responsibility and budget management rules and pension reforms were implemented towards the end of its tenure. The looming political risk is that the job creation needed to maintain social stability cannot be addressed without reforms in factor markets. The complex web of laws does not allow enterprises to grow. The next level of reforms should simplify laws in the land and labour markets, which will significantly improve the ease of doing business in the country.

Finally, Modi should know by now that India is being held back by inadequate state capacity. The government does too much in some areas; and it does too little in others. It needs to build capabilities to manage the fastest growing large economy in the world—but not fall into the interventionist trap that it so often seems to be doing these days.

Recent history has clearly demonstrated that economic growth is the best solution for poverty alleviation and improving standards of living. Therefore, the challenge for the Modi government would be to take the Indian economy to a sustainable high growth path. And the next two years will be as important, if not more so, than the past three years.

What should the Modi government do to increase the rate of growth? Tell us at views@livemint.com

Policy/Economy,"India, America and the geopolitical chessboard: America’s ruthless self-interest seeks an India that is strong enough to act as a regional counter to China but weak enough to be kept in check by rogue Pakistan.",21,2w7l4p,http://www.dailyo.in/opinion/india-america-and-the-geopolitical-chessboard-foreign-policy-barack-obama-narendra-modi/story/1/2102.html,19,,Fluttershy_qtest," Of course. They are not propping up India because of goodness of their heart. Did anyone applaud the masterstroke that was Sri Lanka. A regime change was bought about certainly due to Indian influence which India will not confirm or deny. This will certainly has upset China, as Rajapakse was China's sweetheart. Modi's foreign policy is look east which IMHO will reap benefits.  This is the statement I have been barking from past 2 years everywhere , But I always get shitty replies -"" times have changed, we should forget Russia "" , ""we are democracies"", we are that or we are this. Simple thing No Super power will allow other countries to develop, which may challenge them, in 1970's they sucked Chinese to oppose soviet union, Now they want relations with India to stop china, tomorrow they do same thing against India with Pakistan .  In 2014, a slow year for the Indian economy, India grew at a rate of somewhere around 5%. (Estimates vary from 7-4.x, so 5% is a reasonable middle of the ground number.) 

This meant an addition to Indian GDP of about 100 billion dollars. In comparison, Pakistan has an economy of around 245 billion dollars.

So in a bad year, India will add to its economy half a Pakistan, and in a good year, India will add to its economy one full Pakistan. In a decade or two, the relative economic disparity between India and Pak, which is at 10:1 today, will be around 20:1.

How can such a tiny power, that cannot keeps its own children safe, keep India in check? American strategic thinkers are many thing, but math illiterate they are not. 

Forget these conspiracy theories peddled by foolish NAM types, and too clever by half hidden-Islamists, and venture forth boldly into the future.  I don't believe that the American political system is capable of long term/very long term foreign policy strategies this article proposes it's doing. 

America's foreign policy is like any other country's foreign policy, just reacting to what pops up day to day. Somedays you're an enemy, and somedays you're a friend. ",2015-02-18 01:16:55

###Headline Stories

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

Policy/Economy,"[AskIndia] Is India on its way to becoming a Fascist nation, or is it already one?",27,5ectir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ectir/askindia_is_india_on_its_way_to_becoming_a/,43,"Umberto Eco, a famous author who lived under the fascist regimes of World War 2 Italy, once listed 14 features of Fascism. Reading [that list on open culture](http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html) got me thinking about how a lot of people throw around the F-word when referring to modern India, and I figured that r/india would have answers for this.

Two caveats. One, I'm as biased as you are regarding where and how I get my news, so maybe I've been hearing Fascist, while you're hearing Reformist. Two, I don't actually have any proof that says that this list is definitive proof of fascism. It's Umberto Eco's opinion, and if you take issue with it, feel free to go spit on his grave.

Here's the list:

> 1. The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”

> 2. The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”

> 3. The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”

> 4. Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”

> 5. Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”

> 6. Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”

> 7. The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”

> 8. The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”

> 9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”

> 10. Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”

> 11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.""

> 12. Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”

> 13. Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”

> 14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”


What I'm taking away from this mostly pointless exercse, is that Indian society is quite susceptible to Umberto Eco's model of Fascism, largely due to its deference to tradition, a lack of cultural identity and a burgeoning middle class.

EDIT: Since a lot of people seem to be confused about this. Wikipasta for Fascist beliefs below.

> Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature, and views political violence, war, and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.",won_tolla," If you have been noticing, ever since the 2008 economic crisis the whole world has been moving to the right. We had minor EU nations embrace neo-fascism in their governments and now the bigger nations around the world are sympathetic to fascist ideology.  even if we take this list as gospel, it would be an overreaction to say we are on our way to fascism.

2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 from the list do not apply in the remotest to us. It's hilarious that almost all those points are true for America too. America is Fascist? Baba all firangi models fail in India.

You are being a little paranoid. Keep Calm and move on ! Do an experiment. 

Go to nearest village which is not exposed to reddit. You will get the following:

* heroism
* conspiracy
* machismo
* contempt for weak
* xenophobia
* rejection of modernism
* cult of tradition
* disagreement is treason

I can describe 

* each religion in the above terms
* each heirloom and long running dynasties
* each political party
* Occupy Wallstreet movement
* Bring back democrats movement

in the same points.

Policy/Economy,Some examples where credit ratings agencies have been disproven and discredited time and time again,13,7dskdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dskdq/some_examples_where_credit_ratings_agencies_have/,9,"Should Indian government really be celebrating? Here are some examples to think not - 

1.""In November 1998, the day after the Japanese Government announced a large-scale fiscal stimulus to its ailing economy, Moody’s Investors Service began the first of a series of downgradings of the Japanese Government’s yen-denominated bonds, by taking the Aaa (triple A) rating away. The next major Moody’s downgrade occurred on September 8, 2000.

Then, in December 2001, Moody’s further downgraded the Japan Governments yen-denominated bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2. On May 31, 2002, Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s long-term credit rating by a further two grades to A2, or below that given to Botswana, Chile and Hungary.

In a statement at the time, Moody’s said that its decision “reflects the conclusion that the Japanese government’s current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in Japan’s domestic debt position … Japan’s general government indebtedness, however measured, will approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world, and as such Japan will be entering ‘uncharted territory’.”

The then Japanese Finance Minister responded (with some foresight): “They’re doing it for business. Just because they do such things we won’t change our policies … The market doesn’t seem to be paying attention.” Indeed, the Government continued to have no problems finding buyers for their debt, which is all yen-denominated and sold mainly to domestic investors. 
How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana’s, has the world’s largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world’s largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people 

In the New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/business/international-business-japan-battles-bond-rating.html] the logic of the rating was questioned:

2. Comment by formers President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and former member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bob McTeer who is described as having “free-market views” which “gave the Dallas Fed its reputation during his tenure as “The Free-Enterprise Fed”” (Source). McTeer says:

    It may just be me, but aren’t the credit rating agencies supposed to be rating credit?

    Yesterday, we saw a sharp market reaction when one of the rating agencies that gave AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities larded with subprime loans called into question the credit worthiness of Britain. As is the case with the United States and the Federal Reserve, Britain and its Bank of England have the ability to create new money if necessary to pay off its debt at maturity. There is no sovereign credit risk. There is no need for credit rating agencies to opine on the credit worthiness of sovereign debt.

    Sovereign debt is subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates in general rise, outstanding bonds, sovereign and non-sovereign, will decline in price, the extent depending on how close they are to maturity.

    Sovereign debt is also subject to inflation risk. Holders of the debt are harmed if inflation outpaces their expectations when they purchased the debt.

    When Standard & Poor questions British bonds, they must be making a judgment about some risk other than credit risk. Given time, investors will learn to take such questions with a grain of salt and not overreact. Meanwhile, haven’t they done enough harm for this cycle?""

4.""Ratings agencies admit mistakes - Credit rating agencies have admitted errors were made when assessing some of the financial instruments that have been blamed for the credit crunch.

Representatives of the three main agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moodys - were grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

They said that their assessment of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages turned out to be incorrect.

But they said these instruments were not too complex to rate accurately.

""The assumption that we made about how these assets would perform in the future turned out to be incorrect,"" said Ian Bell, head of European structured finance at Standard & Poor's.

Iceland role

Credit agencies carry out work to determine the worthiness or otherwise of financial investments.

They have been accused of failing to spot the size and risk of the bad US housing debt that was resold around the world, causing multi-billion-pound losses.

It was the discovery of these losses that caused the global credit markets to freeze up, and ultimately led to governments around the world having to bail out their banking sectors.

The ratings agencies said that credit ratings were just one factor that investors should look at when making investment decisions, but admitted that less sophisticated investors may have been over-reliant on their assessments.

The committee also criticised the agencies for failing to warn their clients adequately of the problems faced by the Icelandic economy before its banks collapsed last year.

Some 116 local councils deposited more than £858m in the failed banks, because they offered a relatively high return with a high credit rating.""

5.""Who's to Blame for the Economy? Rating Agencies - A good measure of who is responsible for getting us into this mess is looking at who got rich off of it. Bond ratings agencies certainly got their share of the take.

Moody's Investors Service ( MCO) saw its profits quadruple between 2000 and 2007 and had a higher profit margin than any other company in the S&P 500 for five straight years, according to opening statements from Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations, in a congressional hearing on the ratings agencies he held in October.""

The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC)[39] set up by the US Congress and President to investigate the causes of the crisis, and publisher of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (FCIR), concluded that the ""failures"" of the Big Three rating agencies were ""essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction"" and ""key enablers of the financial meltdown"".[40] It went on to say

    The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms.""

8. Moody's And Japan - But think about the Moodys statement in relation to Japan. The logic (and that is being kind) goes like this:

             1. Economic growth is low in Japan and is pushing tax revenue down and welfare spending up – hence the budget deficit rises.

              2. Given the Japanese government doesn’t exercise its legal right to spend without issuing debt to match the spending, the rising budget deficit (as a result of the cyclical downturn) also means rising public debt.

             3. Moodys asserts (with no analytical or conceptual basis provided) that these rising deficits are in some way a problem per se (rather than being a reflection of the real problem – slow growth).

            4. So in their Pavlovian fashion, they downgrade the credit rating presumably suggesting the Japanese government is a credit risk without acknowledging the Japanese government can never be an credit risk unless there is a collective brain explosion and the Government legislates to renege on its financial obligations.

            5. They downgrade because the slow growth makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit without acknowledging that the budget deficit should increase to meet the challenge of slow growth.

           6. But then you are left to ask two questions. First, the Moodys logic would suggest they want to increase the borrowing costs of the Japanese government by reducing the demand for bonds (because the lower rating is meant to scare investors) which if you believed their type of reasoning would further negatively impact on economic growth. So what sort of logic is that? Moodys (if you had their model outlook) is saying the Japanese economy is damaged because of the recession but we are going to make it worse and therefore worsen the problem of credit risk.

           7. Second, of-course, neither their implicit notion that Japanese government debt carries a credit risk or that their ratings change anything anyway are valid. Note that a sign that government paper was not an attractive investment prospect might be rising yields as investors avoided demanding the paper. But Moodys acknowledges that there is an “undiminished home bias of Japanese investors and their preference for government bonds, which allows the government’s fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally”.

So who would you bet on? A corrupt capitalist firm that has made some monumental mistakes in the past while handing out AAA ratings to firms who were paying them to rate their products or millions of investors who every day purchase Japanese government debt at stable and the lowest yields? The same investors who have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising and public debt ratios heading up beyond 200 per cent (compared to the ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold of 80 per cent) for the last 20 years.""

8. ""What mindless rule is being applied here?

The whole thing is mindless. To repeat, the logic appears to be: Cut deficits to keep the Aaa rating – but that would undermine growth and push up the deficit and debt – which undermines the Aaa rating.

And the politicians and everyone else goes along with this nonsense. We really are not a very bright race of people.""

",kejjj12345," It is a positive development. Rating agencies are deeply flawed institution and they do make a lot of mistakes but In practice their rating matter. They move the market and the upgrade will lower the cost of borrowing for the country which is good.

That's all folks
",indianstartupguy," Finomena shutdown ? :O ""License Raj"" is misleading for the articles linked below - compliance and license raj are quite different. Great compilation nonetheless. Appreciate the effort. So these crores of money lost by startups.. are they like investors money? And they will all be just cool with it? I'm always curious what sort of discussion they have when reporting such a big loss.",2017-07-30 11:10:45
Policy/Economy,"For redditors, by a redditor: The Current Currency Situation of our nation explained.",29,1lie6f,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1lie0b/eli5ed_version_of_indias_currency_crisis/,34,,PlsDontBraidMyBeard," Good work..But you have defended Chidambaram / Congress quiet well there and have solely blamed it on booming US economy / BRICS just like UPA apologists like Mihir Sharma does..Investors are not moving to other countries just because US economy is picking up , they are moving because starting a business with this fucked up govt is a braindrain.

 Watch [Truth Vs Hype on Food Security Bill](http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/truth-vs-hype/truth-vs-hype-who-s-afraid-of-the-food-security-bill/288918) with as much less Congress hate as possible.

IMO, FSB is a good bill, passed at the wrong time. OP, you have spent your time writing stuff up - educating people and sharing something you believe in and that itself is commendable. 

Most people don't even know the basics of economy - so this post could be a good starting point for further discussions. I saw somebody calling you out as a socialist - and that shows how under-educated even our elite is(assuming those on /r/india are elites). You could perhaps expand more on why our government decided to spend a large amount of cash on welfare policies and compare the same with few first world nations. 

Personally, I believe govt should just focus on governing and the rest should be left to the economy. They do a bad job at everything they touch so policies like National Corruption Guarantee Scheme are bound to fail in India. But even while I say that, the policies themselves are not that bad. Guaranteed employment, food, education etc are all very good and noble ideas. Hopefully, someday we will have a stronger economy to implement these ideas well.  Does it mean that if a lot of people stop using cars value of Rupee may go up?

Also good work OP. I think it's a combination of both the export/import gap as explained, but also the result of economic slowdown in India and continued questions about India's fiscal responsibilities.

 Commenting to come back and read later. It has been a fantastic read so far  OP is telling facts !! He must be dynastly-loving *sickular* !!

Le reddit India army, attack !!


PS: Great work ! Guys, I know it's long but pls give it a shot.  ALL WRONG! HOW DARE U NOT BLAME DA SICKULARS FOR DIS!!!!!!!! Bhaii it's really long so will probably save it for tomorrow, gonna read it on boss's time not on a Sunday..

But honestly, I tip my hat for the effort and all..

Great personalities.....let's not criticize them just because current congress leaders are incompetent. Nehru looks like old Charlie Chaplin. You can just hear them saying... 'Bring cash.'
