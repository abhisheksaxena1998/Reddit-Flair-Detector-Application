> Mumbai: A 36-year-old man was arrested in Chunabhatti in Mumbai in the early hours of Sunday for allegedly uploading a post on Facebook claiming the novel coronavirus outbreak was a government conspiracy and that people should not reveal information to authorities.

> An official identified him as Shamim Iftekhar Khan, a resident of Qureshi Nagar in Kurla East.

> ""His Facebook post claimed the virus does not exist and it was a conspiracy to target certain communities by the government. He also asked people not to give information to authorities during surveys in connection with the outbreak,"" he said.

> He was arrested under sections 188 (disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of IPC, and provisions of Disaster Management Act, the Chunabatti police station official said.",2020-04-06 16:43:15

> Earlier this week, a video of a group practising a 
ritual in Sufism was falsely shared as intentional sneezing inside Nizamuddin mosque. 

What he was doing may not be deliberately to spread covid-19 or something like that but still is unhygienic. he should still be taken to action. His daughter's claim seems a bit false tbh. Never heard of anything like that.

As far as the sufism ritual stuff goes...who cares if they are sneezing or not? That's still incredibly unhygienic and will spread infections. Just because they arent actually sneezing doesnt make it clean or appropriate. Ha ha, jaise Hindu vendors to bohot hygenic hai na?

Australia is an oppurtunistic country exploiting international students for more than a decade.

No support for International Students from Australian Government. But, Australian Government would like if international students can risk their life and work more than 20 hours in Nursing homes & supermarkets.

International students contribute billions towards Australian economy and now they are being told to go back if they can‚Äôt support themselves. The government has underlined responsibility if the education providers can‚Äôt run the course they took the money for. You can‚Äôt justify leaving the vulnerable students under theses compelling circumstances.

The declaration students signed while applying for student visa for Australia was under implied understanding that the economic situation of their home country will remain somewhat unchanged dramatically.

Current circumstances are exceptional and exceptional support for all human being is required.

Canada government is helping everybody including students and work permit holders and all other canadian residents (either temporary or permanent) by paying them $2000 per month for 4months ..it called Employment insurance...America government is also helping peoples who loss their job and struggling with crisis . Newzealand government and England government did the same except Australian government .

Australian PM just straight on told the student  'Make your way home'. If you can't pay us.

Future students, think before you apply for a student visa to Australia. > While Tokyo is among the nations

Tokyo is a nation ??! Whats worse is some countries are asking international students to go back to their countries for the time. I am supposed to go to Canada in September, in the loan application process, but with a pandemic so severe, not just me but many like me feel depressed and not. Hopeful of the future. I truly hope nothing changes much and we are able to experience the education that we are paying so much money for.

Given the communal narrative being spread against them, this makes them extremely vulnerable to community backlash and hate crime.

A BJP Health Minister himself [revealed the names, age and locality of Nizamuddin returnees](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/this-is-why-the-names-of-the-nizamuddin-returnees-who-tested-covid-19-positive-in-assam-were-revealed) who tested positive in his state in an official press conference. He then asked the other Jamaat attendees to also come forward to face the same ""treatment"". Any guesses how many would willingly come forward now?

In most other parts of India, so far the administration [has made efforts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/those-revealing-identity-of-covid-19-patients-to-face-action/articleshow/74590731.cms) to preserve patients anonymity, but I guess these rules can be bent if there are ""special circumstances"".

Yes, you could make an argument that other people need to know who they are so that they can stay away from them, but that can be easily achieved by using [hand stamps](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/privacy-fears-india-hand-stamps-suspected-coronavirus-cases-200320120033460.html) or [""Home Under Quarantine"" stickers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-covid-19-stickers-being-stamped-on-houses-of-home-quarantined-families-1660543-2020-03-28), though IMO even these methods should be employed only on willful violators. But at least with these methods, only your immediate neighbors will know rather than the entire city/nation and any potential backlash will be minimized.

Charging people with the draconian National Security Act (which allows detention without charges or trial for up to a year) is also counterproductive, while that will definitely make violent people think twice before assaulting health workers, ordinary Muslims in UP, who are already deeply distrustful of the Yogi government, will now be even less forthcoming about their symptoms to health workers. 

Similarly, by now we have all heard of [how 5000 migrant workers were sprayed with bleach](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/india/india-migrant-workers-sprayed-intl/index.html) to ""disninfect"" them.

Thankfully the identities of none of our covid 19 cases (neither Hindu or Muslim) have been leaked. Also anyone who gets infected is a patient who needs treatment from a highly infectious fast-spreading non-discriminating virus, not a terrorist or anti-national. COVID19 has wrecked havoc across the world and everywhere governments are trying to find hospital beds, ventilators, and medicines for the ill, and here in India we are trying to find who to blame. This jamaat gives media the opportunity to steer away attention from the stranded migrants situation, so this won't stop. Jamaat guys infecting others is a better headline than the hungry crying migrant family pic coz it shows administration in bad light Agreed. It's genuinely worrying to think about the number of cases that might pop out once this lockdown is over since there are so many people who need to be tested but aren't. Putting fear in people is only doing worse. I'm sure a lot of these people are scared that if they do come forward and end up testing positive, hell will break over them.",2020-04-05 11:21:00

this sounds kind of dumb, but what exactly is the BJP's ""IT cell"" ? from context i've picked up that it seems to try to persuade people to vote for the party ^aka ^spread ^propaganda but afaik, it's kind of a constant thing going all year-round as opposed to picking up intensity during times of election.

my current view is that it's the party's own, separate PR campaign/group, not *technically* from the government's official mouthpiece (as an institution) but from the mouth of the BJP as a party that happens to be in power. if i'm incorrect though, i'd really appreciate someone letting me know! thank you!

That could literally reset the economy to the 1950s and then the supreme leader will show it should be done unlike Nehru. People who refuse to accept this new truth of our existence are living in denial. This is a life altering event. We will have to live with Corona virus everyday. Masks, gloves and hand sanitisers will become items of daily use.

Many businesses will have to shut down or change their operational practices. Movie halls, malls, gyms, educational institutes, salons and massage parlours and restaurants are just some places that will have to change. My local D-Mart has made masks and hand sanitisation mandatory.

Businesses that cram scores of workers into open plan layouts will have to change their layouts or risk turning into a hotspot and getting closed down completely. BTW, I see that as a positive side-effect. Nobody should have to work like an animal in a fattening pen.

Dharavi is huge and it's not all slums like a Hollywood film or Gully Boy. There is a sizable middle class living in gated societies too.

And when almost everyone belong  to a single group (Religion here) people get irrational hatred. That's what unfortunately happens in real world . Obviously doesnt make it right no one can help with that not even Govt. To be fair it isn't just that.

But this doesn't mean that you label the whole community. You can't use the worst part of a group to label the entirety of the group. That is sheer stupidity.

Let us take a moment to understand the brilliance of our beloved Prime Minister's newest strategy to defeat the menace of the Corona Virus.

As my scientist friend from NASA has informed, on April 5, 2020 the suns rays will be the most powerful & very intense. 

Also, the planet in our Solar System shall be in a very favourable position. 

By using this unique planetary alignment - we are shutting down light to maximize the cosmic setting and using natural light instead of our electricity.

Allowing this universal heat will automatically weaken the corona virus - since it has never experienced this phenomena ever before!

Twenty-one day lockdown - 4 hours. ‡§≠‡§æ‡§°‡§º ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§æ‡§è ‡§ú‡§®‡§§‡§æ, ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡§æ PR ‡§¨‡§®‡§§‡§æ‡•§ All you fuckers make sure to switch your external lights as well. Planning to set up my telescope. Electric lights help Corona spread. Supreme leader has found the cure. All praise Modiji Sooner or later, Corona virus will be blinded by the stupidity of Indians I am not a bhakt but I normally don't jump at every occasion to blame Modiji. But this is too much. I did clap on March 22, even though I thought it wasn't the need of the hour but just to show solidarity I did. But this time I refuse to participate.

Modiji needs to understand that we have enough challenges on Fb and whatsapp to keep us occupied. He doesn't have to create new entertainment for us. 

Corona garba was barely 10 days ago and he wants to test people again? High time he stopped acting like big boss and started acting like a responsible leader. Taiwan‚Äôs VP is an epidemiologist, German PM is a physical chemist. Singapore PM a computer scientist.  Hong Kong chief executive a social scientist. Our PM has a masters in entire political science from distance learning. 


Maybe there‚Äôs something to the quiet competence of professionals Thinking face Bro your post says 5 April 2014... Its 2020 currently Yaar sab log khali baithe h h. Kucch h nahi karne ko. Let them have this little moment of community and togetherness. Sabko pata h is se corona pe lauda farak nahi padna Fire fighters : *Sweating Intensifies* Earlier we tried sound. Now we will try light. If this doesn't work, we'll all collectively fart. Now people will conduct candle marches on the streets on 5th April. Like the wedding processions last time. He saw the Spanish and Italians clapping for the healthcare professionals and felt he should get India to do the same. And he saw earth hour recently and decided we should do something like this as well. I expect people to come out in full swing, burst crackers, chant BMKJ, JSR and accidentally burn something. He specifically made out to reason that it would strengthen us.

Bhai, kaise lawde log hain duniya m?

Diye jala ke Gareeb logon ki pet ki aag bujh jaayegi kya? Yes kis chutye ko prime Minister banaya Dude straight up telling you to get candles because shit is about to hit the fan! *True, but -* ***""Even a broken clock is right twice a day""****.  Well, it depends on the* [*clock*](https://i.imgur.com/YcHKNib.jpg) *you are speaking about!*

*Showing off is the fool's idea of glory -Bruce Lee*

*Sometimes glass glitters more than diamonds because it has more to prove- Terry Pratchett* i think if modi would say mitro apna lund 10 minut tak chusne se corona nahi hoga people wilk really break their ribs to do that. So are candles now essentials ? He's just fucking with us at this point I am glad he is spewing this nonsense. Even the dumbest of bhakts will soon have an epiphany and wake up from their stupor. Bhai Sunday ko light kaatne wale hai yeh log ffs i find it ridiculous beyond belief

But it also tells you how gullible our population is. No wonder they kept voting for Lalus, Mayawatis, DMKS/AIDMKS Gowdas etc etc and now Modi....

Though the big difference is so far i always felt that people who support such jokers are others, however since last 6 years i am appalled to see my very own friends/family/neighbours/community supporting this regime and such nonsense. Modi will next ask every Indian to strip naked and dance for 10min on April 10th at 10 PM and there will be another set of posts from WhatsApp university  explaining how that will get rid of Covid - 19 or fill the world with positive energy as per UNESCO or NASA or IIT or whatever other random organization or random ancient Indian text comes to mind and people will spread that around too.

Just like how the Janta Curfew was followed by people clapping and making all kind of noise, but harassing front line medical staff next day onward.

Dr. Ambedkar's apprehensions in 1949 about the hero worship mentality prevalent in India leading to its downfall were so right on the spot. They think loyalty and obedience to politicians or govt is love of the nation.

Our country filled with Sheeple. Even adding scientific temper and spirit of inquiry and reform as fundamental duties in the constitution of India was meaningless because even the literate people don't have an education or the ability  apply their brain and get educated. This is the perfect ""Andher nagari, Chaupat raja"" scenario. > Modi asks all citizens to switch off all lights for 9 minutes at 9 PM on 5 April 2020 to beat Coronavirus

It wasn't ""to beat Coronavirus"", but, as he said, it was for building up the morale of the people staying at homes (thinking that they alone can't win the fight) by an act that sends the message that we are all in this together.

He also mentioned that Social Distancing must not be abandoned while doing this, but you didn't mention that in your post.

This, for him, was to build the morale of the people, in other words, for the mental health of people. (We still have a little more than half of the period of lockdown ahead of us, and then some). Ab toh candle march niklenge Whats the problem with the electricity?   The requirements foe electricity is all time low due to all corporations are closed. Modi: ""Bhagwan ke bharose raho... mere bharose mat raho"" At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if this doofus comes out next week asking us to splash gaumutra from our balconies. Note that he switched from 8PM to 9AM because that time slot is the highest TRP rated timeslot currently due to Ramayana telecast.

Ramchandra Guha was right all along. This guy is continuously doing farce at the time of tragedy. 

Self obsessed narcissist. This is PR. > This man truly believes he is some Super Star Conjuror.
Those who plan to spend 9 mins on this utter stupidity need to seriously reflect on their priorities.

This will be the headline the next day. I dont think the point put across by the govt through Modi was that by lighting up flashlights we can defeat the pandemic. It's more of creating a feeling of unity and responsibility I guess. I mean we see videos of other communities doing similar things and crosspost in subs like mademesmile. Plus, I don't think all minute details need to be addressed by Modi himself. His message goes to millions of people in our country who connect emotionally rather than intellectualy to their environment. In that scenario, creating a common emotion goes a certain distance in overcoming this.                                                                                                           PS: Not a bhakt. Just a lil annoyed by the fact that most of the niche 'intellectual communities' like reddit or other social platforms cant help but find the grass always greener on the other side. Tackling a situation like this in a country like India is very much different from other countries. I don't think this is the time to blame and hate. Let's fight this shit together. It's basically to show solidarity during these difficult times. This has got to be a joke, right? I was waiting about the announcement and its fucking this? Although burning candles/diyas is unnecessary, Modi also reiterated that people shouldn't break social distancing under any circumstances which is an important message. 21 days lockdown is an ordeal and we would need constant reminder to stay at home. Kya dramaybaazi hai bc lol Whatever be this bullshit.. I'm ok as long as people are going to be quiet and not banging their plates.

And thankfully he specified people to not venture out and do it only from their balcony.

What beats me is he can give sufficient heads-up for such useless ""solidarity"" activities when the real measures like the 21-day lockdown are dropped like a bomb. Dear bhakts, next time you see a hopeless gareeb/bhuka just don't aid him financially, just don't feed him any food or just don't help him in any tangible way, just jump in front of him and simply blind him by flashing your phone's _fleshlight_ into his dooomed and hopeless eyes. Smh. If you have 1 minute to spare before lighting the lamp, take a look at [covidindiasupport.com](https://covidindiasupport.com) 

We are building India's crowd-sourced library of regional data, resources and support groups related to COVID-19 and are looking for volunteers. Modiji‚Äôs intellectualism:
I have hit a lot of rock bottoms only to discover a rockier bottom beneath. 
~ Bojack Horseman. It will be like ""taare zameen par"" come sunday.
Enjoy mitron. Here we go, [bullshit](https://i.imgur.com/yi1UDve.jpg) has started. He had to say balcony this time too. People who don‚Äôt have balconies will do same what they did last time. Hit the roads. 
And with fire. Damn Sometimes janta shows stupidity and sometimes this man What about people who don't have balcony or even a house?

Has anybody else also noticed that Modi addresses only middle class & rich, never the poor? Earth: finally able to breathe!

Modi: hold my beer

Seriously tho what good will this diya thing do except for polluting? Lighting up trains I think he is going to cut power, for the whole country, starting with a 9 minute drill Can we please shift the date to 9 April?

So it‚Äôs 9pm on 9th for 9 minute!!! **April 5th is Vamana Dwadashi**. 

On that day, the earth gets maximum light from Sun and this empowers disease causing viruses. The virus is a evil entity and it thrives in darkness. According to **Adiyogi Purana**, one way to destroy such evil entities is to focus light on it, like we do with magnifying glass and sun's rays. 

It's towards this that the Prime Minister has asked for us to switch off all lights in our house (too bright), and use a focused, small light to show our support. The small focus of all our candles, diyas etc will focus into a powerful beam and strike at the heart of the coronavirus.  

Unlike earlier attempts, this is not a **masterstroke** from our PM. This is a **masterbeam**! I think Modi ji forgot that besides absence of electricity in Ramrajya, there was an absence of hunger, poverty, corruption, injustice, violence and chaos. I mean I get it that Modi is trying to keep the spirits high, but what will really make happy if they broadcast a roadmap or some plan in the next couple of days. Did you hear Modi's brilliant speech on how he's handling the migrant workers, their deaths, the financial taskforce that he created, and how he'll provide PPE to all medical workers in India?

Me neither. Good thing this modi guy isn't a prime minister or anything. Chutiya gya h Modi. Budhapa aa gya h. F##ker wants us to beat thalli, light candles, torch. Seriously wtf this gadha smoked? Instead of giving us information about the PPE for doctors and medical workers, he is telling us to turn off lights. Idiot! The scientific reason is that after 9 pm, when there is dark outside, switch off all the lights at once so now there is Pitch black. Corona won't be able to see anyone, just use some of the Nala Gas Mitrogen to make him unconscious. Then take him to the clouds where radar can't detect him, beat the shit out of him. Keep asking him that in this formula  


( a + b )¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤ + 2ab  


How do we get an extra AB.  


He'll be scared & confused at the same time. The moment he runs away, It's party time Baby, take out your THALIS coz u have the rest of the night to bang it. Last few days have been all quiet on his front! With the lockdown and all. A definitive case of ADHD. He could've atleast explained the current state of the situation like how prepared are we and how the government is going to take care of the economy and the poor. Instead he went directly into his gimmick. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Doctors: can I has more equipment, labs, testing kits? 

Gobi ji: No. Hey but look at these blinking mobile flashlights bro, trippy af. I think his pr team is just screwing with him now Template for your next WhatsApp forward:

Modiji is so brilliant. 130 crores of diya and lights will create so much of [some assumed term here] energy that it will [write something stupid here, who cares]. Forward this message to other bhakts. I am waiting for the whatapp messages telling science behind it. 
Tanmay @sentiyapaa (twitter) 

> Masterstroke by PM Modi. One cannot stop admiring him. When billions of people will burn candles and diyas together, it'll release a huge amount of heat and light energy into the atmosphere. This will increase the atmospheric temperature and Coronavirus can't survive.
Modi Modi. Wonder what is next? 

On April 12th, at 12 noon, everyone will do a booty dance? LOL Indian citizens : testing kits needed, how bad is the situation people are dieing, no supplies in big cities, we need hospitals for covid, etc etc..

Modi: this Sunday let's do candle dinner..

Kaha milega itna content nobody:

absolutely nobody:

Modi ji: chaliye mitron, 9 baje bandar ban jaiye. I am seeing stupidity like this from many world leaders and public too.. They are also throwing us under the bus. I feel so scared. One way or other, I feel like like it's going to be really rough in the future. As if something very bad is going to happen. I feel so scared. 

Living in india and among the ignorance, superstition and naivety of Indian people, I feel really really scared.

Leaders are disappointing on another level now. ModiG announces Janta Curfew, then full curfew for 21 days followed.

ModiG asks you to switch off electricity and light candles, may be a power shut down is oncoming for 21 days. * Sound - Check
* Lights - Check
* Mic - >Asks all citizens to light up candles, oil lamps, etc on the threshold, in balconies.

What's the point when led/CFL lights already produce light? Do candles and diya produce any special kind of rays that kill coronavirus? Thaali thukayi ka kya result mila? UNESCO/RBI kab report degi? uske sathe ""hum honge kamyab ek din"" bhi ganna padega, to show our dedication and strength to the corona virus. take it bitchcorona. > Thanks to Modi ji I will now find out who are the intelligent people in my locality by looking at whether their lights are on.

bartan baja ne ke time nai samja tha? as you guys know the blackout is on 5th april at 9 pm, if you bring 5 and 9 together it is 59, 59 pronounced in Japanese is 'gokuh' which sounds like goku and as we know goku is super strong we will beat corona. this is nothing! see what my family group is forwarding!

EvErYtHiNg iS a cOnSpIrAcY Somewhere in a corner of a room, Modi might be thinking:
""Dekho in ch---yo ko, padh likh ke kya ukhaad liya. Mai bina padhe hi inse jo ch*---yapa karana chahun, kara sakta hun. Hahaha"" OP checking in, anybody got em candles, i went out to get em but got my ass whooped instead. üò≠ Modi is quickly becoming like India's own Mao Zedong.His cult personality exceeds BJP's popularity. Take my word for it, hospitals will be vandalized and doctors attacked for not switching off  power and gathering at the entrance for Mudiji's Hakuna Matata. Modiji has combined both his favourite activities for Sunday.  
Keeping people in the dark, and burning stuff. Hypocrisy is at the finest.
When Italians sing partisan songs,and y'all cheer them up for being United in the face of a pandemic, it's all goody goody.

But when Modi simply is saying everyone to bring their flashlights out, you're getting incensed?

Lol,talk about being so much indoctrinated with hate for the ruling government that y'all have lost your marbles. He is providing Instagram material so people dont feel bored at home. So are we like, officially, a cult now like North Korea? To keep people (Modi-tards) busy at night, so that they don't go out causing ruckus on the streets being little shits clearly disrespecting the lockdown
Modi gave them something to do

After all, khali dimaag Shaitan Ka Ghar hota hai >All this is meant to do is distract people

This man just wants excuses to get on TV. He‚Äôs acting as if he came up with the idea of clapping at 5pm, thats what pisses me off the most. Read it in his voice: Khel khelo, ek ke baadh ek khel khelo. 

Inb4 bhakts start claiming sound energy killed half the virus, now the smoke from diyas and the light energy from flashlights kill the rest of it. Duh diya lights kill the Corona virus. I'm surprised you guys didn't know this already Ab toh bhakt bhil bol rahe honge ‚ÄúPapa ji iss bar thoda jayda ho gaya.‚Äù Modi ne kuch kiya hai, matlab soch samajh kar kiya hoga. People like us will not understand that powerful all knowing brain. BC corona ke test na karana. Doctors ko saftey kits na provide karana. Migrant workers ki help na krna. Bs chutiyapanti krna. üôÇüëå The truth is he wants you all to act stupid on 5 April, so you all can gather in streets and spread the disease as much as possible skyrocketing the infected cases. Do you think he cares about poor people dying? Lol 

So in the end he can ask IMF, world bank and UN for billions and trillions of dollars donations and use them for BJP own purposes. Get lost i don't have any candles left, even if i had them I might need them if the lock-down is extended. i was blown away when Sri adarniyaPM Modi Ji said light diya, candles and switch of light.

Har Har Modi, Har Ghar Modi

PS: Maro mujhe Maro Koi Too many diyas will create cosmic heat that will be helpful in melting the virus Waiting for our artist to mock this artistically. No one is forcing you people to light a candle. This is just a way to unite people. I have my own issues with the speech because it was too vague and didn‚Äôt give a lot of information about the situation but you guys are just batshit crazy. I‚Äôm not into politics and I‚Äôm not on anyone‚Äôs side. Not a Modi supporter and not anti Modi either. But your anti Modi bullshit is making me cringe like hell. What is the problem with lighting a candle? It‚Äôs just symbolic of unity and solidarity in these times. Do it if you like and if you don‚Äôt want to, then don‚Äôt. No one is asking you to splash gaumutra from your balconies. He‚Äôs not trying to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù corona virus by lighting candles, DIMWITS. Crores collected through funds. No mention of fund utilization yet. New whatsapp messages on the way,claiming this 9pm thing to be a masterstroke. WhatsApp uni will be like 

‚ÄúAb tho  modiji sahi hai, you know the PhOtONS in the mobile torches will reflect on the virus in air and break it down and kill wah modiji wah to sahi hai ‚Äú Hopefully they'll not mess this up in their excitement and do something like on March 22nd Lets defeat darkness by switching off lights and lighting candles which doesn't glow as much as regular lights. THE FUCK. Time for me to mute my whatsapp group notifications. Yayy whenever i hear mudi speech my mind says: la\*\*\* ka sarkar hai. Motherfukeer wanks off to billions of people blindly following his commands. Lmao wtf is this guy doing hahaha I'm really excited now what he proposes next to fight the virus. lol,Did he explained how would this bring any help ? Corona virus be like: mai MC hun jo india mein aaya Waiting to see a whatsapp post about how this is a masterstroke as light would deatroy the darkness of conora because at that time conora is the weakest and modi kaka should be awarded with Noble Peace Prize for this Just wait for people to start lighting fires as if it‚Äôs Lohri. As long as you are not asking for money you are good in his books. Mention a relief package and see how bhakts term you deshdrohi. i cringed hard. wtf Candle aur diye lene bahar ja sakte h kya ab? Modiji bole h toh essential me Aa gya hoga Hopefully proprlw don‚Äôt come out of their house like the preivoud time they do for dance and selfir with friends which totally fail the curfew in first place. I'm afraid of indefinite power cut beginning a midnight soon. i am not doing that. Our PM is officially handling this worse than Trump, Johnson, and Rouhani.

This is Bolsonaro levels of bullshit. Don't write off all your neighbors .... it could be a forced powercut.  

Stay well. ‚ÄúBahut se tubelight aise hote hain‚Äù The message is to appreciate the work of healthcare providers, security force and social workers who are helping us in this COVID-19 fight. Why be so against somebody that everything is jhumla and not an actual appreciation act. Come on guys, don‚Äôt be that juvenile. Man I really don't understand why you people are spreading so much hate whenever Modi asks us to do something like this. The only thing he is trying to do is to spread more positivity. Something like this will give us a sense of community and a sense of belonging, which I'm sure a lot of people need right now. We get it, you hate Modi and everything he does, but why can't you be supportive for once? 

Also he never once said that lighting a diya will magically beat coronavirus, now you're just plainly lying. >will now find out who are the intelligent people in my locality

That's 150 km away in line of sight. Incredible! 

> The Jalandhar residents woke up to a phenomenon, which most people said, that they saw it for the first time in their lives. Wish I could see the same from Delhi Due to lockdown so many positive news about nature and environment is coming now. It is like we just forgot earlier how beautiful our country is and there lies so many beautiful vistas in every city.

If any of the grid trips, we are definitely doomed, people might be on ventilator and it will be major chaos for law and order. Conspiracy theory: the whole point of the exercise is to identify the anti-Modi households. This buffoon really doesn't think through the idiocies he wants his disciples to do for him. This 9 minute power off is definitely going to burn down some transformers and other equipment in the country. [removed] folks, let us not confuse switching off lights to turning the electricity off. no matter how dumb the entire batti bujhao exercise is.

we turn the lights off every morning. this is a mountain being made of a molehill. lets just skip this whole tamasha. in fact those who switch off tomorrow are the ones who would be anti-national. I really wish it fucks up the grids for 24 hrs in BJP ruled states. Just to show everyone the results of his stupidity.

Let them do the rest of the work. Here are the arguments I used to convince mine:

1. If one person gets it and brings the virus home, everyone is at risk, specially the elders. The person breaking the isolation will be solely responsible for everyone's health and any bad situation that arises.
2. The virus has caused deaths and complications even amongst healthy young people. Even pets are at risk.
3. They'll literally feel like drowning and out of breath if the symptoms become worse.
4. In case of a wide outbreak, there won't be enough ventilators and beds in hospitals, and of course no visitations. The situation will be extremely grim in that case. 
5. This isolation also means no guests, casual roaming outside, gossiping with neighbors up close etc.
6. They should use the time to educate themselves, learn new skills, and spend quality family time. Not on WhatsApp groups, reading crap forwards.

You can find sources to support most of the arguments. Tell them if anyone gets infected, will be taken to hospital and there will be no visitations and eventually (god forbid) that person will die lonely... www.nymag.com/intelligencer/amp/2020/03/the-story-of-a-coronavirus-infection.html Uhh try using statistics and reddit.",2020-04-03 21:22:47

Coronavirus,Quora is full of hate !!,17,fvwclb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvwclb/quora_is_full_of_hate/,11,"Quora used to be my favorite platform back in 2014, mainly because there was so much new to learn and only those people were answering who actually had knowledge regarding the topic ( Professors, Scientists, Military Historians )

Now, it's full of hate speech, low-quality answers and cringeworthy questions like - ""What are some destruction level 100 tweets"" or ""What are some badass tweets during Covid-19"". It's filled with young Indians who have zero knowledge about the topic but don't hesitate to write their senseless opinions and comment hate. 

What's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. There are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  Civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-Hindus and Liberals in almost every problem. 

My personal experience : 1) A guy literally wrote an answer saying Italians are victims of Coronavirus because they are liberals. A commentor on same answer even wrote that Italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". Both of them were Indians.

2) Many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. Then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) One guy literally posted tweets from BJP Trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'. 

4)  Multiple answers ""completely"" blaming Muslims for Coronavirus ( Tablighi Jamaat should be blamed 100% but not the whole religion )  

Then not to forget some quorans who think of themselves as some sort of celebrity. Quora is still fine if you read posts from non-Indian writers although it's sad that the quality of it has declined greatly.",jags1611," Quora is noxious. Full of bhakts and paid content. 

It can be useful sometimes if you have a specific question in some niche, but you shouldnt ever go there *looking* for good content Quora got infested by Indians like a virus and has never ever been the same again. My Canadian friend told me back in 2017 he is leaving the site because its infested by ""your countrymen"" who ask the most absurd questions, and somehow reply with the most bizzare replies that shove India even when the question has nothing to do with india.

I have been banned maybe 30 to 40 times in the past 2 years, sometimes for even offending some right wing Indians sentiments. I got banned last week for an answer to a question: why are most of left journalists biased against India. This is my response copy paste:

They're not. Indians are so conservative, so obsessed with culture and heritage that anything that even goes slightly against their traditions or establishment becomes left wing propoganda.

The most left leaning journalist in India would be considered right leaning in the western nations, and left journalists that you take for granted in Europe or America would get shot or stabbed in India within a week of publishing their articles or stating their opinion.


I challenged the ban and they responded by saying: Thank you for your appeal but we stand by our statement.

All these western companies will one day be run to the ground by Indians when they realize these Indians will not pay nor support them when the time comes. I mean a right wing party is in power in Italy but sure they are leftists Why Quora when you've got reddit. 
Common theme on quora : 


- Quorans are better because they are not wasting away their time on fb/insta/WhatsApp 
- A person blaming all his problems on reservations. 
- Some men want to support gender equality but can't because ""why extra coach for women in metro and bus seats""
- Men giving befitting replies to pseudo feminists
- Some women writing their answers because they are different (better) than other women
- IITians writing eroticas
- what are some epic replies to......
- what are some epic tweeta.....
- what are your favourite memes...
- some ePic insults The worst thing about Quora is that it's high on Google search rankings. Reddit>Quora",2020-04-06 18:24:31

This divide will only further deepen if we allow the endless flow of misinformation and fake news through whatsapp and other social media sites.

With the coronavirus further slowing down an already relatively slow economy and increasing an already high unemployment rate, such misinformation will definitely cause more riots (or worse, a civil war).

The ones who will be affected the most by this are the poor. During the Delhi riots, most of the people who died and suffered were either poor or of the lower middle class and the ones who are suffering now due to the virus are also the poor. They will only further suffer if such misinformation that causes communal tensions are spread.

To the people who have read this post till now, if you see anybody in WhatsApp or any other social media site posting any misinformation or fake news, I implore you to call them out for spreading such misinformation and tell them that it is ILLEGAL AND PUNISHABLE if they further do so. Whether you are respectful to them or not is at your own discretion. If they still don't stop then report them to the concerned authority.

Coronavirus,"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ‚Çπ17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why",386,fv9ifd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/,61,"Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ‚Çπ17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ‚Çπ17,000 crore, ‚Çπ11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new ‚Äúdisaster mitigation and response fund‚Äù üí∞ at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. üòé 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*‚Äù

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 üìù. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court üë®‚Äç‚öñ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (üôÑ) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court‚Äôs got no business in the executive üíº working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter üö´

Similarly, the approximately ‚Çπ6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union‚Äôs devolution under the XV-FC‚Äôs recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I‚Äôve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi‚Äôs SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",ringtring," I would especially like to emphasize page 99 onwards where the methodology for calculating state share of SDRMF is given. Some people were complaining that why Kerala has been allocated so less amount compared to Maharashtra. There were several speculations and baseless theories (eg- north-south discrimination) but none of the critical comments, in my knowledge, mentioned about the finance commission recommendations, which is the actual reason. None of them bothered to critique the recommendations.

I think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by XV-FC in allocation of state share of SDRMF funds. People critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards. This will help them base their criticism on actual facts, rather than their imagination. You can give all the justification and 'due process' you want. We all know the *real* reason why Delhi got 0. >The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is  because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi  in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state.

Yes so Delhi must get money then directly from centres funds right? like NDRF or the PM relief fund. I'm sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with Delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco Leave all technicalities. Can someone tell me how is Delhi supposed to operate without this fund? Basically the question is why were these alternate mechanisms not used? Great post u/ringtring. Kejriwal has been moaning about not receiving funding to combat the crisis and this is a great post explaining why Delhi was not allocated funds.

Either Kejriwal does not know the reason (mentioned in the post) or is willingly not mentioning it to create a sense of bias against AAP by the centre. Either way, he needs to get his facts right. Nice research with Finance commission recommendations.

But the recommendations of the FC is ADVISORY and hence NOT BINDING on the govt. . So nothing like constitutional obligations. 

Also PM Cares has a lot of fund now so it can be used straight away ... so I feel the ball is in Central govt. court now to get funds for Delhi and put the end to this issue and not politicise by playing around. I think Kejriwal is all in his rights to ask for funds.

http://www.arthapedia.in/index.php?title=Finance_commission This just sounds like bullshit based on limited understanding on so many levels. Let me tell you a few reasons why this simply cannot be true:

1) Let's say the disaster was limited to Delhi. Would they still give money to everyone - all states but Delhi? Of course not, they would have given money only to Delhi in that case. It's truly absurd to think that the centre is restricted from handing out funds to Delhi government in case of an emergency.

2) The money may not come out of SDMF but could come out of any number of places including but definitely not limited to the PMNRF or PM CARES fund. If you are saying that it is simply not possible for centre to hand out money to Delhi government to deal with COVID-19, that's simply absurd.

3) Delhi is going to get money sooner or later of this doesn't get better. It's only a matter of time. And the question would be why were they not given the money sooner, like the other states. 

4) At the end of the day what matters is that money that comes to the Delhi government, not the  route that it follows. It's a job of the centre to figure out the route and they are definitely not ""helpless"" in not giving money to Delhi. If they wanted to, Delhi would have had the money by now. Thanks for research. What nonsense. Let me get the timeline straight.

BJP 2014: Elect us Delhi, we will give you statehood.

BJP 2015: Elect us Delhi, we will give you statehood.

AAP 2015-2019: Give us statehood.

BJP: No.

AAP 2020: Give us money for tackling a pandemic like every other state.

BJP: Sorry, you are not a state.

Fuck off! We are going through a freaking pandemic right now....To hell with all the bureaucracy and politics about delhi not being a state..we all know the real reason why delhi didnt receive aid. So it is more like. We will make sure everyone suffers as we did not win the election? Your accusation of judicial activism is severely misplaced.

> It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis

I wonder why the SC saw issues with how it has been setup.

The job of SC is to make sure than every citizen of the union gets treated equally. It is also to reign in on power excesses. The executive branch is already the most powerful branch of the three and we need SC to balance the structure. Do we know how much of that money did they allocate to each state?",2020-04-05 14:49:55
Coronavirus,India lags in Coronavirus testing.,75,ftmk8x,https://i.redd.it/e0v9b6g8seq41.jpg,28,,sudden_dust," india ka to dhakkan bhi nahi dikh raha hai. This should get more attention. Everyone is losing their minds about the recent spike. They were identified only because contact tracing for the Jamaat attendees was done. There may be 50 other such events from early March where attendees haven't been identified and tested.

Pending more testing, it should be assumed that there is a community spread of the virus. Guess that's what led the govt to announce the lockdown. Design critique: They should adjust the amount of liquid in the tubes to show data, changing the size of the test tubes doesnt make any sense We don't need tests. We need religious ceremonies. Thankfully, almost 8000 tests were done yesterday alone; That's almost 1/5 of total tests done till now.

I mean publishing such reports [Source ](https://mobile.twitter.com/IndiaToday/status/1245696300160434179) Do we have any idea what the plan for testing is? Are we ramping up significantly?

Looking at countries all around the world, this is the most important question - and I have no idea why there's no clear answer for this from our leaders. I understand it won't be perfect and it might take a long time for a nation of our size and capabilities, but NO recovery or 'end of crisis' can be declared without testing.

We really have to stop getting distracted by all the other issues and consequences for now (as important as they are), and focus on fixing testing first. I would like to see the testing data for India, after taking out Kerala.",2020-04-02 21:43:55

Coronavirus,Get ready for a huge surge of Muslimophobia and Hindu nationalism after/during this lockdown,23,fvdta1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvdta1/get_ready_for_a_huge_surge_of_muslimophobia_and/,5,"I'll be straighforward: our country already has a lot of Muslimophobia (I am not gonna say Islamophobia because hating Islam as in ideology shouldn't be treated as a bad thing. Treating Muslims badly because you hate Islam, on the other hand, should be bad) and Hindu nationalism is evidently on the rise. Even though at first thought, it might seem that coronavirus may not affect the rate at which these two are growing, it is going to affect it in a huge way. 

The biggest blunder has to be the Tablighi Jamat. Out of 3000+ cases, 1000+ cases (more than 33% of the cases) has been linked to the Jamat. Among the rest, if you just see the initial list of dead people from corona, you will see a lot of them (if not most) had visited Saudi Arabia or other Muslim countries. As you might know, Muslims are already blamed for almost every historic and bad events. There is a huge chance that the entire coronavirus epidemic in India maybe said to be 'brought by Muslims to harm Hindus'. The number of fake news which tries to show that Muslims are deliberately trying to harm Hindus is already bad.

Unfortunately for Muslims, during this crisis when they were already being alienated by CAA-NRC, Jamat has been responsible for the steep rise in cases. Not that Hindus or other religions did not do something like that - Hindus got together in Vaishno Devi, they got together in many festivals, they got together during gaumutra party, they got together for 'thali bajaa'ing. But there has been no cases linked to any of those events. It might be that there are coronavirus carriers and cases among them, but since it isn't testable and observable, we cannot make any definite statement, it won't be scientific.

To make things worse, if we somehow get through this nightmarish pandemic, remember Modi will get all the credit. People will say that ""Modi handled the pandemic in India well"". This might even increase his approval rate among common people. Not to mention that if the apparent growth rate of cases in India remains slower than other countries, as it currently is, it might increase people's faith in the  superiority of India. People might say ""Look at those immoral westerners. They have been punished for their immoral lifestyle by karma. That is why India, such a holy land, hasn't been greatly affected by it apart from those Muslims and Chinese who brought that disease to India!"". This narrative might gain a lot of attention.

Coronavirus,We might have entered the exponential growth stage of infection in India that is characteristic of the spread of Covid-19. Here's how.,43,fvajor,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvajor/we_might_have_entered_the_exponential_growth/,19,"The number of cases in India has risen exponentially in the last few days. [Going from 150 cases daily to now 500-600 cases daily.](https://i.imgur.com/zjRoSAJ.png) 3730 total cases in the country as of today, a week earlier, there were 1180 cases.

Seeing the [growth trajectory of the confirmed cases country by country](https://i.imgur.com/noXGCYY.png), it can be seen that India is still on an upward trajectory AND has not yet reached the peak, one essential thing that shows the slowing down of infection in a country. With other countries, you can see they've started to curve in the graph. So the worst is still yet to come, and we won't know how much the rate of infection has been until testing capacity is increased multifold. The infection spread rate however have slowed because of the lockdown.

The country needs to be prepared with the worst that is yet to come, with PPE, Ventilators and all other necessary equipment.

2. https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#all-charts-preview",pizzafapper," People act in such denial. Like there‚Äôs absolutely no reason why India won‚Äôt follow the same curve as other countries. And if it doesn‚Äôt, it means we aren‚Äôt testing enough people/recording enough deaths. 

Stop acting in denial and stay home. simple calculus.

exponential growth happens according to an elementary differential eqn. that dictates - ""increase in patients at any time is dependent on the absolute number of patients at that time"". it means that if there are more patients at a time, the increase in patients at that time will be larger because more patients ( actually their counterparts who are not yet detected, assumed to be large if admitted people are more ) have much pronounced effect on increase than a smaller pool.

exponential curve is just a solution to this differential eqn. 

so to get a different solution ( exponetial decay or some decreasing function, which is ultimately required ), you will have to change yhe differential eqn itself. or in other words, remove dependence of increase on the patients themselves. This is why lockdown helps. if someone is infected, he can spread if lockdown is not imposed but can be averted if it is.

BUT hear me out. this is important.

even after imposing nationwide lockdown, this eqn appears. it means it is not fulfilling its purpose. it reflects inner loopholes. 

#and this is the reason why any lockdown will never work in this country.

- reasons

- 1) people are idiots. they feel as if govt is against them. its not.
- 2) govt releasing good news makes people play this virus very weak. people feel themselves at a lesser risk because they see good news and will be willing to venture out when police isnt patrolling, will never follow social distancing when shopping etc.
- 3) govt does not think before acting. simple. they are bunch of beta males who dont know what to do when doom strikes. this is evident in every casualty we have had. every indian who has died, dies because it was transmitted to them from ones who came from outside AND YET stupid govt let everybody in without strong checks. its as if coronavirus itself beat govt. k",2020-04-05 16:29:08

Well that‚Äôs funny isn‚Äôt it? In my personal opinion this moment is just used to distract people coz in recent 3 to 4 days the daily new COVOD19 cases are more than 500+.

Coronavirus,Coronavirus Exposes India‚Äôs Official Callousness,19,ftgfv9,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-01/india-s-government-should-have-expected-coronavirus-migration,1,,silentr3b31," //The largest lockdown in history is not, to put it mildly, going as planned. Within a few days of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing on national television that the country was being shut down for three weeks, hundreds of thousands took to the country‚Äôs highways, marching long distances back to their home towns and villages. Others thronged bus stations‚Äîthe trains are not running‚Äîhoping for a bus back home. At least 22 people have reportedly died in the mass migration, exhausted and hungry.

The point of India‚Äôs lockdown, as elsewhere, is to prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus. But, if anything, this vast movement of people likely means the virus will find its way to the poorer rural parts of India where it could do the most damage. There‚Äôs certainly little social distancing in evidence in the photos of thousands of people jostling each other waiting for buses.


All this could‚Äîand should‚Äîhave been avoided. There was no need for the government in Delhi not to prepare citizens for what a lockdown would entail. Nor was the government itself anywhere near prepared for what the crisis would ask of its own resources.


It can make no excuses for this failure. Given how minimal quarantining and testing has been, it‚Äôs been obvious for weeks now that some kind of Wuhan-style shutdown was inevitable in the world‚Äôs second-biggest country. And yet the government seems to have worked harder on its own public-relations battle than on figuring out how the lockdown would affect India‚Äôs poorest people.

This reflects something deeply callous about the Indian state. The government should have recognized that those who earn a daily wage, who might not be able to make rent or even eat, would need to leave cities for their homes in the countryside. Part of the reason it didn‚Äôt is that these people have always been invisible to the Indian state. Successive governments have sought to set up welfare systems targeting farmers, or workers in the formal factory sector, or rural women. And, when this administration‚Äôs relief package was announced, it was precisely those groups who received aid.

Yet those who have taken to India‚Äôs highways are the urban poor and recent migrants, who receive very little welfare because they made the mistake of moving away from the villages where they vote and receive their food ration. By relying in this crisis on the same welfare system that pretends they don‚Äôt exist, the government left them with no other option but to pack up and leave.

Officials probably didn‚Äôt want to get adventurous about their relief package and push out more money, quickly, through the channels that already exist. But, as I argued last week, any such shutdown requires the government to move beyond its comfort zone and do things it hasn‚Äôt before. At the very least, Modi himself should have had words of reassurance for those most at risk when he announced the shutdown. Part of the Modi mystique is that he himself emerged from relative poverty, making his government‚Äôs blindness to the poor at this moment that much more depressing.

The scenes that played out after the lockdown‚Äîpolicemen beating up grocery shoppers and deliverymen, exhausted 90-year-old ladies walking 400 kilometers, migrants being hosed down by a chlorine solution‚Äîhave exposed the cruelty that too often infects India‚Äôs dysfunctional state machinery. This is awful at any time but it‚Äôs particularly dangerous now, when the lockdown‚Äôs success as a public health measure depends upon public cooperation and trust in the government.

This deafness to the needs of its own citizens is, in fact, part of why the Indian state struggles to respond to emergencies. Yes, India is a democracy and its leaders are accountable to citizens. But the state itself does not always behave like a democracy should. Democracies do well when every level of the state machinery works to anticipate what people need. Here in India we have authoritarian instincts combined with democratic liberties. It makes for an ineffective combination‚Äîand one that is particularly ill-suited to fighting a pandemic or minimizing human suffering.//

Imposition of Financial emergency need to be passed in both the houses of parliament.  

SC may not  direct the parliament  to push the bill. The Supreme Court has no business in this. It is a political decision, and they know well that it is a political decision. They ought not to have admitted this petition in the first place.

But the Supreme Court judges just *love* being in the limelight. They can't say no to such a juicy matter. So they have admitted it, they will conduct a hearing on it (when all other matters are suspended due to the Coronavirus). The judges love their space on the front page of the newspapers. If we are lucky, they will pass an order saying it is not their place to direct the govt to impose an emergency. If we are not, they will kneel before Modi and request him to impose an emergency for the welfare of the country.

The Constitution is very poorly drafted when it comes to the Supreme Court, and gives them way too many powers without oversight. The writers of the Constitution thought that the judiciary will behave with restraint and dignity, so they didn't feel the need to be prescriptive. Big mistake.

>Homeopathy or homoeopathy is a pseudoscientific[1][2][3][4] system of alternative medicine. It was created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann. Its practitioners, called homeopaths, believe that a substance that causes symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people; this doctrine is called similia similibus curentur, or ""like cures like"".

>Homeopathic preparations are termed remedies and are made using homeopathic dilution. In this process, a chosen substance is repeatedly and thoroughly diluted. The final product is chemically indistinguishable from the diluent, which is usually either distilled water, ethanol or sugar; often, not even a single molecule of the original substance can be expected to remain in the product.[6] Between the dilution iterations homeopaths practice hitting and/or violently shaking the product, and claim that it makes the diluent remember the original substance after its removal. Practitioners claim that such preparations, upon oral intake, can treat or cure disease.

Edit: Added original article link that is going viral.",amzed_can," Have you posted this on Facebook? I want to share this Great work on the replies and the links! I would suggest adding more, and as many as possible (we can help!) so this becomes a sort of mega post with sources that we can share with whoever encourages stupidity and blind worship of the govt. I see that the original article has no links or sources where as you provided sources. That's what these people do they rely on their flimsy opinion as whatsapp needs no sources but to prove them even to people that don't support them they need sources. Anyway great work. The fuck the target post reads like my 6th standard school essay. What shitty level of sycophantic behaviour is this. Isn't this the same article that was posted on rediff ? Who even believes this is written by someone who is not a BJP supporter? I don't even bother getting into an argument with people who post these (which rather sadly was done by atleast 5 people on my timeline who went to premier institutions in the country - all were priveleged upper class Hindus even before I met them during my post grad). I feel like it's impossible to change someone who is well read and still blindly supports everything the government does. The chance that they will turn on BJP at some point of time is the same as me voting for BJP anytime in the future. I wasn't a big fan of Modi (2002 riots) but was hopeful of a sea change in India's development and corruption with the majority they had. 5 years of Modi has all but buried that hope forever. In a country of 1.3 billion people it's a miracle we have a PM that an overwhelming majority would listen to and I would love to be proved wrong about him by the way he leads us through this crisis. Our economy is going to take a while to recover with the US economy already crashing but if we come out of this with competitively less human casualty I would he appreciative of Modi for doing so This is my take from it.

Coronavirus,"Coronavirus update- TB vaccine in childhood may offer Covid-19 protection: Researchers | India started BCG vaccination of children in 1949, and currently 97% of 26 million children born in India receive the BCG vaccine free.",35,fsw1fo,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/childhood-tb-vaccine-may-offer-covid-19-protection-researchers/story-nCeO65fOBQbvLIylXUAhlI.html,7,,AlternativeDrop6," BIG, if true. But lot of Chinese people died, the official number is not even close to reality. Unfortunately this isn't a scientific inference. It's based off map data. It appears that countries that hadn't discontinued the vaccine report lower infection rates.

The key word is ""reported"". It could just be that it's a wrong correlation because a bunch of BCG countries happen to be underreporting. Seems unreal..

&#x200B;

Still hoping for the best.. This study has been published in a journal which is not peer reviewed ie. people can publish almost anything they want without appropriate verification. There is no credibility to this whatsoever, and the association seems tenuous at best. 
It's a shame that several credible media outlets are publishing this without any expert analysis.

Coronavirus,Your annual reminder that India's AYUSH Minister promised in 2016 that we would have a 'yoga-based' cure for cancer within a year.,391,fu1ly8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu1ly8/your_annual_reminder_that_indias_ayush_minister/,43,"Spoiler: We don't. 

Please note, he said ' prevention and cure' and not 'treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'palliative treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'help reverse the effects'. 

> ""There is an institute in Bengaluru. They have found a yoga technique for prevention and cure of cancer. We have collected all documentation and the process is going on,"" Naik told reporters.

Please note that he said the 'cure' is already in the testing phase and will be approved within the year. Please note he said this is 2016. Please note that he said that the cure had been 'proved' - in 2016. 

> Mr. Naik said a technique for such cure developed by Bengaluru-based Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA) is just about a year away from endorsement from his Ministry.

Please note that the media mocked him and he never said it again, but he didn't apologise for giving India's 14 lakh cancer patients false hope. Remember this when you listen to his and his ministry's comments on coronavirus.

Not related to Ayush. But since focus on psuedo science, actual science failing.AIIMS aren't getting enough funds or not in making That ministry is a joke. They are the real cancer. I dare you to post this in the chaddi subs :p Similarly, some time back, I had seen a  video where Subramaniam Swamy claimed that the original Sanskrit texts are being properly translated and we will soon have a ""vimana"" that flies using mercury as its fuel. 

If anyone has any news of the progress (if any) in this direction, I would be glad to hear about it. For a normal human 1 year= 365 days. But for a yogi, 1 normal human year is nothing. I yogi year= at least a millennia of normal human years.

Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, told a news agency - ""Around 1800 people from different districts of Gujarat were stranded in Haridwar. With the special efforts of Union Minister Mansukhbhai Mandaviya and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.‚Äù As a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport reached Ahmedabad from Haridwar. Interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of Uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.

An order issued on March 27 shows that these vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport were sent directly to Gujarat *under the instructions of the Chief Minister's Office*. Their purpose was to bring the people of Gujarat trapped in Haridwar to their homes. **While returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of Uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the Uttarakhand government.**

Workers from Uttarakhand (working in Ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home.

Mukesh Kumar says- ""The next morning, on March 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home.

It is being said that all these people from Gujarat had reached Haridwar to participate in some religious ritual. These people are supposedly close to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. **It is also clear from the official statement of Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in Haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the Home Minister directly.**

Well it smells like hypocrisy, isn't it. Sahi pakde hain. Bhakts have been grabbed by the balls now. On a serious note, feel sad how those who wanted to return back to Uttarakhand were dealt with. > It is also clear from the official statement of Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in Haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the Home Minister directly.

This should be investigated against the Home Minster, as these people are potential threat vectors to others and this is an abuse of power by Home Minister. And, this is a scenario where rich and connected get taken care of but ordinary people don't.

> The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh. We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. But that didn't happen either. '

This should be investigated, but my guess is since the driver didn't take these people to Uttarakhand, it might have been the driver scamming them. Well why was this done during lockdown for these people? Any special reason ? And if an exception was made for these people surely the same can be made for others too. Religion, wealth, skin color or caste does not make you superior - only your acts do. The day we understand this, India will progress. If Congress had any intelligence, they would have made an issue out of it. Is there any English media covering this?

Coronavirus,"PM CARES Fund better suited to deal with coronavirus crisis, say legal experts",32,fsrqbo,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/pm-cares-fund-better-suited-tto-deal-with-coronavirus-crisis-say-legal-experts/story/399670.html,43,,Crocbro_8DN," So, can't PMNRF release funds to PMCARES? In general donation to a Government agency is a bad idea as they are massively inefficient in deploying the funds and a large part will go to administrative expenses (as Rajiv Gandhi famously pointed out). Also many State Governments are out of cash as their GST portions havent been released in a timely way from the Center. Much of the expenditures are coming out of State Budgets.

At any rate many state Governments are commandeering private hospitals and even asking NGO hospitals to purchase the quarantining materials.

Some NGOs are organizing food for poor people and animals. If we can seek out such NGOs and donate it would be best bang for the buck. God damn, that article just stopped short of cradling PM's balls in their mouth.

What pathetic business journalism is this. Flawed arguments in every paragraph. Better suited to whom? >The contribution towards PMNRF is 100 percent tax deductible under Section 80 G of the Income Tax Act. Though contribution towards PM CARES Fund will also get Section 80 G tax benefits, it is not clear if there 100 per cent deduction will be allowed. Not all donations under Section 80 G are eligible for 100 per cent tax deductions.

After so many days since the fund was opened, and is recieving donations, neither the government has clarified this point, nor the journalists were able to clarify it from the government officials. Though the government was prompt in announcing that the donations to this fund can be considered as CSR expenses of corporations. EVERYONE - CARES. Why does everything this government do massively shady? 5 mins attention nahi milta modiji ki ko aur chalu hojate hai. PM won‚Äôt let Coronavirus upstage him. Period. TLDR:

People have been asking why a separate fund was created when the PMNRF already exists, here's how they're different

*  Any spending from the consolidated fund of India required legislative approval. Therefore, a donation based fund takes care of that legislative hurdle (PMNRF is also donation based)

* PMNRF does not allow micro donations. While the new fund allows donations as little as 10 rs. 

Regarding auditing, many people had raised concerns that this fund would escape audit:

Whether it be registered or unregistered, auditing of a public charitable trust is compulsory. PMcares will fall under section 11-13 of income tax act  for which if receipt is over 2 lakhs (which obviously it is), auditing is mandatory. NDRF and SDRF are better choices to deal with situation. PM Cares fund as a PR stunt or otherwise is kind of unnecessary in its entirety.",2020-04-01 11:27:21

Coronavirus,Coronavirus lockdown: Tipplers in Kerala with withdrawal symptoms to get special passes to buy liquor,28,fsppes,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsppes/coronavirus_lockdown_tipplers_in_kerala_with/,1,"Special passes will be issued for tipplers in Kerala to buy liquor but on doctor's prescription that they are showing withdrawal symptoms due to non-availability of alcohol in view of lockdown over novel coronavirus spread.

A decision allowing the purchase of liquor from the Excise department in a ""controlled manner"" was taken by the state government to ""resolve"" what it called many social issues including suicidal tendencies and frustration among people who consumed alcohol regularly.

However, the medical fraternity was up in arms on Tuesday against the government order.

The Kerala Government Medical Officer's Association (KGMOA) has decided to observe April 1 as 'black day' in protest against the order issued late on Monday night.

Dr Vijayakrishnan G S, General Secretary of the KGMOA, called the decision a medical blunder.

The Indian Medical Association(IMA) also flayed the Left government's plan to supply liquor to addicts based on prescription, saying it was not ""scientific"".

Three men in Kerala have committed suicide after allegedly showing alcohol withdrawal symptoms within days after liquor stores shut the doors following the 21-day national lockdown that came into force last Wednesday to try halt the spread of COVID-19. Similar incidents have been reported in other parts of the country including in neighbouring Telangana and Karnataka.

Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country. The sale of liquor in the state has continued on an upward spiral despite the prohibitive tax on legal alcohol and the many dry days.

The state had a record Rs 14,508 crore liquor sales in 2018-19 sold through the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco), the state-owned liquor retail monopoly, compared to around Rs 11,000 crore in the previous year, according to official data.

Maybe they should put a statue in front to protect themselves.

Its only a matter of time, everyone involved will either get sick or they'll stop because it risks their own life and their families life. I'm just so terribly disappointed at how ill-prepared and unresponsive we still are. The healthcare system is already strained. Extra attention should be given to medical staffs so that they don't fall sick and so that they can continue to treat the sick. But they are deployed at the frontline unarmed.

 He forced everyone into reactive action rather than proactive action which resulted in the failure of lock down and now he and BJP has started to shift the blame to state governments and officers for failing to ensure lock down.


This is way worse than demonetization.29 people have died because of lockdown alone, which is as much as the virus has killed.


Reality is if we survive this crisis, he would only emerge with more power , for him corona was a blessing in disguise. Why should he consult as now everyone in the country knows only PM Cares. Rest of us just donate. /s How dare you question the wisdom of our great leader and Demi god modiji???!

Consultanting all state governments for a decision like this needs to be done weeks ahead of time, it requires foresight and a great deal of planning.

This was more of a haphazard decision. PM cares, he has been working day and night without taking a leave. These CM must have deliberately not met the PM. Sounds good, Doesn't Work.

which is why i had opined that the govt really should've talked to all the religious leaders regarding the spread of this virus way back in march itself but we were reeling in the aftermath of delhi riots and playing politics But how do they figure out if they were the one who spread the disease or got it from someone else?

Coronavirus,Why the Tablighi jamaat has less to blame and the Indian state more to blame for the spurt in coronavirus cases due to the congregation than you think,0,fsztrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsztrm/why_the_tablighi_jamaat_has_less_to_blame_and_the/,28,"The event took place from March 13th to 16th. As of March 13th, there was no information about coronavirus cases being detected from the congregration that took place earlier in Malaysia's Selangor. 

(Source: Google search for ""tablighi+jamaat+coronavirus"" for articles that appeared before March 13th [[link](https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus+tablighi+jamaat&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A3%2F16%2F2020)])

It was only by March 16th that information about the cases in Malaysia started pouring in and it was on March 16th that Delhi announced a ban on religious congregations. But by this time, these 3000 odd people had already been assembled in Delhi and come in contact with the international attendees, who presumably had brought the coronavirus. So, it was not criminal negligence or stupidity that made these people have this congregation but, simply, lack of information.

Which now brings me to the second point I want to make. After March 16th, the primary response of Indian state was to enforce the Delhi government's order by getting this congregation to dissipate, which given the information coming from Malaysia was absolutely the incorrect call. All of these people should have been tested for coronavirus and quarantined immediately. Instead, they were forced to return to wherever they came from and two weeks later we are spending our efforts tracing the tracks of all the people who had attended the congregation and all the tens of thousands of people they may have come in contact with during all this time after they left. The bureaucratic inertia of the Indian state took a relatively localized problem and made it much, much worse than it needed to be.",bhiliyam," https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-outbreak-delhi-govt-to-ban-sports-activities-in-wake-of-covid-19-threat-says-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia/story-889ss25ZqbJoG1eUoWn7aJ.html

So they had 10 days give or take to go to their respective residence, self isolate, report their travel history, and yet they did nothing. Not to mention the organizers should've cancelled the event on 13th itself when the order was first issued.

Yet they went on as planned. Care tell how is it justified? Didn't after all this, Tableeghi still have 2000 odd people staying together in closed confines which took the Delhi government 36 hours to relocate?",2020-04-01 21:31:11
Coronavirus,Coronavirus: Assam Doctor Dies Allegedly After Taking Anti-Malarial Drug As COVID-19 Prevention,91,fsbqwj,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-assam-doctor-dies-allegedly-after-consuming-anti-malarial-drug-2203271?pfrom=home-coronavirus-lateststories_live,14,,k3times," I think both Trump and the ICMR here jumped the gun and advised using hydroxychloroquine plus azithro for prophylaxis. The evidence to support these are from small studies so far and more are in the pipeline. While the results are promising, taken together they can cause sudden cardiac arrest due to arrhythmia. Getting an ECG, liver, renal function and electrolytes to rule out underlying cardiac and other conditions is a prerequisite before taking this combination. Repeating the ECG after starting the drug is also essential to look for changes. The ICMR has put out the drugs and its dose schedule in public domain without thinking about the consequences. This combination should be prescribed by an infectious disease or COVID 19 expert and monitored by a cardiologist. Are you sure he was a doctor? Did he take the fish tank one? Any doctors here who could explain why this may have happened? Overdose? One often meets his destiny in the road he takes to avoid it (from the movie Kung Fu Panda) ü§¶ The doctor took Hydroxychloroquine, which is generally safe and very useful in fighting against Covid19 in combination with azithromycin.

Coronavirus,Congress questions setting up of PM CARES Fund to deal with coronavirus,308,fs6odw,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-questions-setting-up-of-pm-cares-fund-to-deal-with-coronavirus/article31210904.ece?homepage=true,39,,naveen_reloaded," The PM is taking the pandemic as his PR opportunity and the irony is that he kept the name ""PM Cares"" as if he allocated a massive budget but the reality is that he is asking for donations. 

Another thing I noticed was that no celebrity donated until PM announced his personal fund. Once he started, everyone is flocking to donate and share that on Twitter. Guys do not donate to PM Cares fund.

Donate locally or at least to the CM fund.

So it reaches the needy faster.

Who knows when the PM Cares fund will reach the poor.

Or if it ever will. Also, just read this on twitter. PMCAREs fund will get only 50% tax rebate. The other funds get 100% rebate.

EDIT 1: I just learnt that there is going to be a ""mandatory voluntary"" 2 day salary deduction for this fund for all public sector bank employees. It goes without saying that this PM do all the right things the incorrect way possible and tbh it is hard for me to trust this man.

PMCares is another stupid move because you are not really sure if the money is reaching to the needy or in politician's dirty pockets. People are bragging about this like it's some kind of heroic move... it's not. If they can donate thousands of rupees to even their nearest hospital, it'll be helpful and will surely give peace of mind the donor that his money went to a noble cause.

History has it, a politician is never a middleman without his own benefits in place. This needs more coverage. Perhaps they've already spent it all on holidays and luxury apartments!

We have to remember that we are in this situation because the governments of the world, the people we elected to represent us as citizens and look after us, have completely failed to do so. They failed to plan and prepare for this kind of a scenario despite countless warnings over many years. Swine flu was just a couple of years back but apparently that wasn't warning enough. 

If a parent abuses it's child through negligence, what happens? The parent is incarcerated and the child taken away. Why doesn't the same apply here? Instead we have a delusion prime minister on a power trip asking civilians to empty their pockets in a time of crisis. That seems fair! Although this question is right, Now is not the right time to ask it.  Ask these questions when epidemic is under control.

The danger is getting closer and our cases will start increasing from now onwards. Congress has got  state governments. It should be a role model and show BJP its own management capabilities. 

I live in Punjab (congress state) and preparations till now are abysmal. Doctors haven't received proper PPE yet",2020-03-31 12:51:21

Coronavirus,Is there any way out of this?,64,fu89th,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu89th/is_there_any_way_out_of_this/,37,"I am from a family that is not full of hardcore bhatks per se but of people who believe strongly in the Whatsapp forwards that do the rounds. Recently, I was in my family Whatsapp group, which said something about how awesome the 9 AM 9 minute announcement thing is because of astrology and shit. I replied in the group with a funny Arnab gif and everyone dismissed it. To make things worse, another unkill sent another video about some doctor explaining scientifically how this astrologically thought out move will help drive away the coronavirus in our country. If you ask me, by believing in messages like these instead of our Medical and Security personnel, who are putting their bodies on the line to fight COVID-19 for us, is utterly disrespectful and stupid. Plain idiotic. Because of all this, my anxiety levels increase and I feel pathetic to be a part of such people who believe in this bull crap of 9 AM, 9 times = mangal and all this shit.   
How do you guys deal with this seriously? I mean it hurts me a lot and I get really sad at times. How do I cope with this?",naigonlassun," I never talk politics with my bhakt relatives and friends. Talk about anything other than politics and current affairs with them and your mind will be in peace, that is if you value the relationship. I have gradually cut the hardcore bhakts from my life because they contribute absolutely nothing to my life. Play Hamlet. When they talk Corona, post regarding badminton. When NAMO, post about otters mating. Do your own thang. üòà Many like you.
Just mute that group and ignore them. You cannot argue with people who do not value facts. That's it. Just learn to avoid them. Mock the idiots. You have to engage them in a conversation.

For this, first you have to educate yourself about the modern scientific and rational tradition. This goes beyond merely mugging up scientific facts! Also, understand our own native philosophical traditions. You should read up on the history and philosophy of modern science, and also on our own classical modes of looking at reality. Why or why not are these two incompatible? Where is the actual difficulty here?

You must also learn the basics of presenting our arguments clearly and rationally. This works best when we approach people not with a snobbish attitude, but with a genuine desire to understand why they believe the things they do. Once we understand clearly how they justify their beliefs, we can better attack their positions.

Finally, note that we ourselves could be wrong. ""Reality is not only stranger than what we suppose, but it is stranger than what we can suppose"". Who knows, maybe astrology etc. will turn out to have some substance in ways that we cannot today foresee. So a bit of intellectual humility helps. Join them, blast them with stupid facts make them realise how stupid they all really are I think this is a phase we are going through as a result of poor democratic decisions. India, in hindsight will realize this maybe 10-20 years later. You or me cannot change these people. They will be like this until they die. What we can do is to try to raise a generation who are sensible enough. Better times will come. By getting depressed, keeping myself occupied with whatever I can, losing it occasionally, make myself and others miserable. Rinse, repeat. There is absolutely nothing to be done. You and I are trained to use logic as a tool to discern truth from untruth. They aren't. That's why no amount of logic will make sense to them.

It's because they speak a different language than us. To them, it's all about emotion. Not logic. All that 9 times 9 mangal bullshit, is what they've been trained since childhood to recognise.

The only way to get through to them is through the emotional shock of people they care about dying around them. Till then, nothing will get through. Increasingly, your family is not your family


It's whatsapp influenced- you cant be there all the time, while the phone can. 

India is very family focused, but I expect people will be switching allegiances to their echo chambers over family. ignorance is bliss, trust me. Tbh these are the people I respect generally apart from their political opinions.  So I just ignore them. Emigrate^TM Whatever the stupids say, if they follow this and stay at home then am fine with it. This is what I think works. If you can't impress them with facts baffle them with bullshit. 

If they says 9PM= 9 planets tell them that's incorrect it is actually 9 spikes of coronavirus virus are weak turning this hour in India. With the heat and shear will of people United together the virus will struggle to exists. Jai Hind. Jai Maharashtra Nahi. I've actually low-key severed ties with a few of them. And I have these bursts where I rant about how their thinking is damaging the country. And say things like how by not voting for the bjp I will die with a sound conscience. There is a silence that persists. This is all in person tho. Nothing on whatsapp, I've quit those groups. Thankfully my mother doesn't think like a lot of them. share videos of the work being done in hospitals around the world. pick countries that are a couple weeks ahead of what is happening in india. you can pic my country, usa. we have hospitals that are short on resources and the honest videos that the doctors and nurses are filming will put a little reality into anyone who views them.

Coronavirus,About the Tablighi Jamat situation,0,fup0z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fup0z6/about_the_tablighi_jamat_situation/,26,"I saw this hit piece on Aaj Tak, about how the Jamat members in Ghaziabad allegedly passed lewd remarks at female nurses, sang vulgar songs and dropped their pants, which is absolutely hilarious to me. Of course, you can't put anything past anyone these days, but I highly doubt that the people who spend most of their lives, away from civilization, locked in mosques around the world, praying, and talking about praying when they're not actually praying, would do anything like that. That is literally the mission of the Tablighi Jamat, they're basically Muslim sanyasis. Seriously, it's a matter of pride for them that they have nothing to do with the ""material world"", as they call it. They're literally oblivious, which exactly why they didn't pay heed to the coronavirus situation. Granted, that was extremely dangerous and wrong, but I still very much doubt that these people even know any vulgar songs, much less that they can muster the courage to sing any in unison to harass the nurses. 

Obviously, there is zero proof of any such occurrence. Aaj Tak basically hovered over a letter from the hospital staff for a few seconds, which said that these patients were being uncooperative with no mention of lewd behaviour, while yelling about ""jamatiyon ki kaali kartoot"". Sure, maybe they have been uncooperative because they're stubborn fools, but I doubt the other stuff about them dropping their pants is real lmfao. 

Of course, this is my opinion, based on my knowledge and experiences, and everyone is free to believe what they want, but I'd encourage you to exercise a healthy amount of skepticism while watching news these days. More so when you're sitting with your family, watching channels like Aaj Tak or Zee News (I know boomers love sensationalized news stories). Don't believe any of it until you see absolutely concrete proof. Most people here know this, but these channels are trying to push a narrative (with support from certain people), and they'll go to any lengths to do so. Facts and consequences don't matter to these people, as long as they get more viewers. It's a win-win for them, their overseers get to disseminate propaganda and stay happy with them, while they get TRP. Then they can say things like ""Aaj Tak ne sabko pacchada, no. 1 since the beginning of time"" and rub it in your faces.",Brokenteethequalcaps," Do you try to search something before going on a rant?

It has the letter linked. The claim is from CMO Ghaziabad. Aaj Tak and Zee News concentrating on blaming Muslims rather than talking about issues isn't new, but the letter they hovered over does mention those things. Now, how much is true and how much is exaggeration can be found only after proper investigation, it just a allegation from CMO at this point and 2 days old today. I find it hard to believe that they were spitting going nude and harassing nurses and staff without any evidence....i mean didn't anyone there try to record it....today even the most mild thing gets recorded and not one of them did Wait till you hear about Christian Pastors fucking young Boys, and like Asaram bapu wasn't a bloody rapist as well.

Religious Criminals are still criminals,  only a moron would say that just because one is religious one can not be a criminal. They do seem to be the perfect scapegoats for the narrative - practising muslims clearly identifiable in the way they dress.

**50% restaurants to shut if lockdown extends; Zomato, Swiggy business down 10% :** Only 5-6 restaurant chains have enough cash reserves to sustain more than a month, the sector will need government's help if there's no improvement after May.

Well, their is always a brighter side of the story! and this lockdown period can well utilized for all the research and development for the new market. Yes! you read it correct, it is going to be a fresh and new market, for you and your current restaurant too. So what does a new comer in the market does? What pre-launch preparation he does ? What he wants to boast about before and after the launch?¬†

Lemme tell you if you want to survive in this new market once this Covid-19 lockdown in India is over, you have to work upon one and only ONE thing and it is your RE-BRANDING & MARKETING! Yes, people must NOT forget your name from the market! and people must know what you are going to offer after the market is open. Obviously you are going to bank upon takeaway orders initially for few weeks or can be a month or two! Now when you know about this right now, then you can always cut short your staffing according to the needs of a take-away joint. Service guys can be asked to work on stipends for a month or can be motivated for the salary in coming month in part payments. Good ones will stay with you! Don't worry.¬†

DO NOT worry about staffing for next few months at-least, because their will be plenty of manpower available, filtered out from those restaurants who did not survived the impact. A great possibility of salary negotiation too.¬†

Work upon the ZERO waste menu. Do some research, ZERO waste menu is something where the only food waste is the stuff which once cannot digest or is toxic/not recommended to eat. For planned ZERO waste menu you may contact here and you might get some professional help if needed.¬†

Get a nice air purifier and alkaline water purifier if possible. Why? well apart from the health benefits, this thing is going to help you a lot in your re-launch event, how? We gonna talk in points mentioned below in a while. Their are hotel grades version for kitchen and guest area as cheap as 40k .¬†

Try to arrange your in-house delivery guy, so that you can save upon the commissions from Swiggy & Zomato, as their will be good number of delivery orders, saving upon the commission can save you your one month electricity bill for sure! Will tell you the ways to promote your own contact .

NOW: All is set you have done all of the above mentioned points, asked your landlord to waive off your rent and luckily he agreed! :)¬†

Its 10 days left now before lockdown gets over, what next?¬†

BOOST YOUR INTERNET / INSTAGRAM / YOUTUBE / FACEBOOK WITH ALL THE ENERGY YOU GOT!¬†

Now its time to hit hard with a well planned hospitality grade digital marketing campaign which is going to make your customers and as well as the potentially new customers about the things you have got for them once the market is open.

Its time to showcase your new ZERO waste menu with cool offers, you are going to shout about the healthy environment your outlet is going to offer to your staff as well as the people who walk in, you are going to boast about the alkaline way of cooking meals, you are going to boast about all the reasons you have for your existing customers as well as new customers to visit.¬†

A WELL PLANNED DIGITAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TAILORED FOR HOTEL AND RESTAURANT NEEDS IS AN ONLY WAY WHICH CAN HELP YOU GET OUT OF THIS MESS AND HELP YOU SURVIVE THE CRASH. ¬†

WHEN HIRING ANY DIGITAL MEDIA EXPERT, ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF HOTEL/RESTAURANT OR F&B SECTOR. Why? Because if they know the 01s of F&B industry then they will be able to target your clients, menu promotions, promotions of your other food services easily. You just need to tell them WHAT YOU WANT. Rest you can leave all upon them, the deals, promo etc too, remember the points mentioned above, and don't worry! Situation is all fine, what is required ? a bit of creativity and vision.¬†

Coronavirus,Potential Layoffs and Downsizing in IT industry post Coronavirus Lockdowns,16,fsa49t,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsa49t/potential_layoffs_and_downsizing_in_it_industry/,5,"Is there a potential layoffs threat to workers in IT industry when this Coronavirus Lockdown ends. What will be the impact of this Lockdown around the globe and the looming recession to the IT industry, including the startups?. Would we see waves of layoffs and unemployment in Tech sector?",azemda," One friends employment is  ""paused"" and another is put on bench. I could be something we'd hear more. It all depends on how soon the US bounces back or else we will have major unemployment among the techies. Yes, one should expect layoffs and downsizing, no business is immune to this crisis, if businesses retrench, then they will start cutting back on expenses, first on chopping board are new venture and expansions, second is cutting current operations costs, which IT is a part of.

I am also worried that as a result of this crisis, the world will become less globalized, I am fearful, that if a policy in US is passed to encourage local hiring and ""locals first"" will mean more protectionism not just in IT, but across all sectors. Only time will tell, but these are real possibilities.

If on the other hand you are talking about India, there was a lot of supply of talent in the market even before this crisis, and things will get worse. I am not hopeful of the current government to have any sort of policy intervention to help, in fact they tend to make things worse.

Best be prepared and cut down on any discretionary spends.",2020-03-31 17:48:31

Not only that, their was more guidelines which contradicted the previous ones and according to these you simply cannot test a person for COVID-19 if he/she does not have foreign travel history. (these were only changed few days ago)

Coronavirus,[SERIOUS] My girlfriend just missed her period amid this coronavirus. What to do? Someone advice please.,29,fs4h8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fs4h8o/serious_my_girlfriend_just_missed_her_period_amid/,54,"Please don't be judgemental.   


We used pullout method right after her last period so that she wasn't ovulating at the time and I pulled out well before ejaculation. Her period due date was yesterday and she has missed it. Now we are really really scared. Everything is in a lockdown. And she is staying with her family right now. Her family won't allow her to go outside. We are waiting for 1 more day and then we will go for the pregnancy test. Fingers crossed on that one.  


If the test turns out positive, what are my options? How do we go for MTP amid this lockdown?  


Thank you.",Throwaway88091," Get Home Pregancy kit from any medical shop, it‚Äôs 99% accurate. You can do it today Sometimes stress causes delayed period. Unless she is like 20-25 days late I think you gotta wait this one out.

More stress is bad in this scenario. >Please don't be judgemental. 
>
>We used pullout method

lol All pharmacy stores are open and honestly if you're that concerned you can go to a hospital as well or schedule a home call as well uses pullout method and says dont be judgemental, kaun hai ye log kahan se aate hai? Badhaai ho You can perform MTP safely till 8 weeks in India, the lockdown shall end by then. 

All the best üëç It's been only one day, I guess that's okay. Wait for some days. Because, as you mentioned that she is living with her family getting Pregnancy test is going to be difficult.  [You should wait to take a pregnancy test until the week after your missed period for the most accurate result. ](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/five-signs-to-take-pregnancy-test) Bhai medical shops kule hai , condoms karid lete , aise samasya me nahi hotel the. Ab Jake pregnency kit karid ke check karlo Sach Mei baap banney Wala ya nahi. The first thing you gotta do as everyone has pointed out is get a pregnancy test and check.

here's what you should do:

1. If the test is positive Consult a doctor over the phone, it's extremely likely on this situation that you can get a prescription over the phone, just be honest with the doctor. And kindly consult the right one and don't fucking Google up and get meds on your own it's irresponsible.

2. If her parents are really really restrictive of her to get out of home then coming out clean is an option ik you don't want this

3. Wait, sometimes periods are delayed and sometimes girls can miss a whole cycle (I'm a witness to that)

4. kindly be responsible and let this be an eye opener, pullout isn't a method it's just playing on your luck something like this is bound to happen


Nonetheless I hope you come out of this situation. Update me congratulations Besan ke laddu Ka order dedo. Congratulations! Aap baap banne wale hain! Dude. Never ever rely on the pullout method. There's something called precum that comes out before you ejaculate. Women can get pregnant with it. Remember this next time no matter what the scenario always wear a condom even when she's on a birth control pill. Pullout method is risky as fuck bro! Even condoms don't say that they are 100% safe. I hope the both of you don't have to resort to an abortion because of your carelessness. there can be other factors apart from sperm-ovum fusion that may cause the date to move by 4-5 days + or -. so don't worry and wait for some time before taking any step.

Lesson for you: use a fucking condom! Go to the chemist and get Pregasure... it costs ‚Çπ50/ bucks.... tell her to set an alarm and take it around 4:30 -5:00 am , (that‚Äôs when the urine is most concentrated, she is likely to get the most accurate result) and also more privacy since family will be sleeping.
After the result , tell her to wrap the test kit and cover in paper and chuck it in the trash. And then chuck some other random trash on it. Breathe and dont panic. One day late is ok. Wait for five more days. In this time  plan to get her pregnancy kit to her. Use friends to deliver it to her, should that be needed. Get two kits and ask her to test over 5 days. So maybe one a week from now and the second two or three days later. If the results are positive, MTP can be done till 8 weeks. I believe the lockdown will relax post 14 apr. use this time to go to a proper doctor. Be honest, and you and your girlfriend should be fine. Good luck. Bro, pre-cum has sperms and can cause pregnancy...

Get a home test. just wait for a few days, its okay for periods to get displaced by a few days especially in stress, and given the current situation it is stressed, hope your test does come negative, and take this as a lesson to use a condom - and this line from the ad would seem much wiser now

> jara si savdhani jindagi bhar aasani Wait sometime, most probably she's not pregnant. ask her to buy a home pregnancy test while shopping for groceries. they are quite effective you should have used protection at first placeüòí Contrary to what people here will say, Pull out method works. Aise hi koi pregnant nahi hota hai. 

Secondly, if you pulled out in time which you say you did. There is absolutely no chance that she is pregnant. Tell her that a doctor told you this. 

She will get her period soon. Sometimes after sex after a long time, period timing re-adjusts. A few days here and there can also happen for a variety of reasons. Nothing at all to be alarmed about.",2020-03-31 10:16:53
Coronavirus,Will lighting a candle matter?,2,fudp5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fudp5g/will_lighting_a_candle_matter/,4,"It was the 10th day of the Nationwide Lockdown imposed by the government to control the spread of Coronavirus which began on 25th March. It was announced a day earlier that our honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation through a short video message. Everyone started anticipating what the message could be considering that when Prime Minister last addressed the nation he called for a nationwide lockdown.

But when the Prime minister addressed the nation he urged on 5th April at¬†9PM¬†for all of us to stand on our doorway or balconies switch off the lights and for¬†nine minutes¬†light a candle, Diya, torch or your mobiles with an aim to fight the darkness spread by coronavirus with light. He further said If everyone lights one diya each, then we will realise the power of that light. we will be able to highlight the objective for which we all are fighting together. He also requested everyone not to assemble in roads and maintain social distancing. He also appreciated people for setting an example of discipline and service. Prime Minister also said that when millions of people are enclosed inside their homes, there must be some who must be asking how can they alone fight this battle against covid-19? We are not alone. This is the power of 130 crore people. This awareness gives us motivation, gives us a goal and gives us the energy to achieve them, it further clears our path. Friends, amidst this darkness caused by coronavirus epidemic we need to constantly pursue to reach towards the light.

This was undoubtedly one of the shortest messages of Prime minister barely lasting 11 minutes and It surprised many when they expected a more action-oriented announcement rather than a symbolic gesture as lighting a candle. We must recall the earlier symbolic call for people to thank everyone involved in fighting the coronavirus on 22nd of March by clapping for them.

When the Prime minister clearly mentioned that the reason for the call for this symbolic gesture was solely to dispel the darkness caused by the epidemic. This was not enough for most of us to find alternative reasons behind this.

We, humans, have a high tendency to fill in the blanks when there is not much information available regarding an issue. Many Linked numerology behind 9Pm and 9 Minutes assuming that the Prime Minister chose the date and time after considering all the astrological logic behind it. Numerous social media posts were immediately created and shared widely and at the same time, there were sceptics to voice their views saying that instead of gimmicks government must concentrate on practical ways to fight the pandemic.

Also, some people who always believed that the Prime minister imposed his religious beliefs reasoned that he stressed the number 9 which holds its very own religious significance and asked not to step out of the house for the so-called demonic exercise. Below is one such social media post which was widely circulated among the certain community.

Be it Navaratri or Navagrahas, 9 is a significant part of Hinduism. They also believe that the mother goddess waged a war for 9 days against the rakshasas for deliverance. Hence the number 9 and the belief that by lighting diyaa, candles for 9 mins everything will go away. Mr Modi has earlier too asked all Indians to bang their plates n glasses in appreciation for the medical professionals which again had a Hindu belief attached to it, to ward off evil. He is a religious leader for many but we have a spiritual author n perfector in Christ Jesus and hence church pls do not fall prey and step out of your homes for this demonic exercise. Be wise and learn to read between the lines. Stay in your homes, let your lights be on and have a good time of family prayer from 9pm on 5th April and make sure you exceed 9 mins

There is no denying the fact the government and health care workers ought to do the practical things necessary to fight the spread of coronavirus and moreover, the government must support the people impacted by the hardships due to the Lockdown.

However, it is also true that we must not forget that a person can be killed not only by the virus but also due to the negativity that we are surrounded by. With the way, the information that comes their way about the havoc caused by the coronavirus there are many people who get very depressed. People die being depressed and their numbers are often not counted the way the people that are dying due to coronavirus.

It is Said that your State of Mind changes when you change your physiology. There are many physical ways to do the same as exercise, Declaration/Incantation/Affirmation, music and lighting a candle, dia is no doubt one such way to change our state of mind. Many of us would be constrained to do any other activity right now and there is no doubt that this symbolic gesture is a simple thing that we can do along with our countrymen showing solidarity against the challenge that we are fighting against.

It is your own choice whether to do it or not and you can also fill the gap by saying that it is not in sync with your religious beliefs. Whatever be the reason and even if the prime minister called for this exercise after considering various factors as being alleged I don`t see any harm in doing what he asked us to do. What harm will it have if you light a candle? I cannot digest any messages of conspiracy theories in this regard. The only harm I can foresee is if you have too much hand sanitizer in your hand while lighting the candle or dia.

Most of us would have stayed in their homes for the past 10 days and it is quite natural for people to feel depressed and uncertain about what the future has in store for them. The most anyone can do to fight the coronavirus is do nothing and stay in the house.

Let us Kill the virus called Negativity at the same time when we fight Coronavirus.

Stay Home Stay Safe!",avilsalins," I don't think the problem is with lighting a candle or diya or flashing torch light. It has its own merit and message behind it which is pretty good gesture - to show solidarity. 

But what has happened is, the PM is just asking us to do such things, whereas not communicating anything about the action plan, the status updates on corona, the testing scenario, have we tried enough to procure PPE and make for our doctors, where and how it the PM cares fund being utilised and so on. 

As a result of not communicating about the ""action plan on how to make the current situation better"" and just asking us to clap, bang thalis and flash torchlight, has created a negative perception about the PM, has raised questions on his and his teams credibility. When you don't talk about the issue in hand but talk about lighting diyas, personally I don't think it's the right approach, it makes you question what the leadership is actually doing? why are they shying away from talkin about the issues in hand? 

In times of crisis, it is very very crucial to be transparent and communicate more than usual, which I don't think we as Indians are seeing and hence all that remains is clap, bang thalis, and flas torchlight. I agree, I don't see any reason to criticize it. It's intended to spread positivity, nothing wrong in that. Lighting a candle, clapping,balcony concerts etc., as we've seen around the world are absolutely lovely and human and sure are great for mental health. 

But people themselves should organise it like everybody did in other countries.

 The pathetic thing is that a PM is instigating it instead of concentrating on real work, it's just smoke and mirrors from his part. Social media pr gag. Nice story bro.",2020-04-04 02:30:36

Coronavirus,Meerut: Family attacks ASHA worker for Corona survey; 4 held,28,fti641,https://m.timesofindia.com/city/meerut/family-attacks-asha-worker-for-corona-survey-4-held/articleshow/74920599.cms,5,,BobLoblawLawBombb," MEERUT: At a time when all-out efforts are being made to stop the coronavirus from spreading, city residents here allegedly attacked a health team that had gone for a coronavirus survey in¬†Kankerkhera¬†area‚Äôs Dayampur village on Tuesday. Four people have been arrested.

The incident took place after an¬†Accredited Social Health Activist¬†(ASHA) worker of the two-member team - who also belongs to the same village - inquired about two members of a family who had returned from Noida and Ghaziabad a few days ago.
Protesting why they should reveal the whereabouts of the two, the family allegedly slapped the ASHA worker. They also allegedly attacked her husband and brother-in-law when they intervened.
Four people have been booked and sent to jail.
Anita Verma, the ASHA worker, claimed, ‚ÄúI had gone for coronavirus survey at the home of one Daata Ram. According to norms, we were asked to note down names and phone numbers of those who had returned from any other district to Meerut in the past few days and get them to undergo a routine check-up from a doctor. However, when I asked for details of the two youngsters who had returned from Noida and Ghaziabad, their slapped me and abused me.""


Anita said Daata Ram's family allegedly also attacked her husband and brother-in-law, injuring them on the head.
Vijender Rana, station house officer, Kankerkhera police station, said, ‚ÄúAnita's husband and brother-in-law sustained major injuries on the head after which they were sent for a medical. A case has been filed against Daata Ram, Rohit, Saurabh and Gaurav under various IPC sections, including attempt to murder.

Coronavirus,Asking for potential ideas we can implement together virtually to support everyone fighting COVID-19 at the front lines in India.,6,fu3zap,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu3zap/asking_for_potential_ideas_we_can_implement/,5,"Hey everyone! I hope you're all doing well.

So, I am not sure if this is the right place for me to post this but I'll go on. 

With the increase in uncertainty and the harassment that the medical staff working at front-lines are receiving off-late, I was wondering if we could do/create something to convey our support, appreciation and gratitude to them?

I think it's heroic what they're doing and that they're not backing down or giving up on us despite the different forms of torments they're being subjected to. 
They definitely need all the support they can get, and since it cannot be done physically, I think we could do it virtually. The same can be extended to everyone who's working to keep us safe. 
Additionally, we could also spread some positivity during these trying times since it's just deaths, cases and false info. being blared on TVs and whatsapp messages.

So, if anyone has any ideas on how we can go about this, please suggest. 
I can draw and create digital illustrations and I am 100% ready to put these or whatever skills I can offer to support this cause. 

Also, I was wondering if we could create a subreddit similar to r/CoronavirusSupport but for India? 

Thank you for reading this huge wall of text. I appreciate any feedback, suggestions and discussions. Take care, stay safe and healthy. 

Tl;dr Can we collectively do something virtually to showcase our support and gratitude to all the people working at the frontlines during this pandemic? If yes, please suggest.",Hijikata_san_mayo13, I was thinking of producing PPE items via 3D printers. Or maybe fund the Doctors directly.

Coronavirus,Today's Modi Mantra pe Vichaar,5,fu557i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu557i/todays_modi_mantra_pe_vichaar/,0,"Many of you might have seen today's news where our prime minister urged us to stand on our doorway or balconies and for nine minutes light a candle, diya, torch etc with an aim to fight the darkness spread by coronavirus with light and highlight the objective for which we all are fighting together on April 5. Even though I understand that to a certain degree action such as this might help in bringing a feeling of unity or showcasing solidarity in the fight of this pandemic among the common people but I believe that a better and perhaps a more sensible course of action could have been suggested by him. Many of us who watch these news are from middle-class family and know that many others are worse off than us presently. How about requesting people to leave some food-items at their doorsteps or society gates. You don't have to donate a lot - you can give enough for one man's meal for a time or maybe even a single fruit and even if you can't there is no problem. Just like the municipal corporation collects the garbage nowadays they can collect this too, maybe the police patrolling cars can do so.

It's just my personal opinion and there might be many better ideas. What do you guys think?",Shwetanshu07,,2020-04-03 17:15:34
Coronavirus,"Sandesh, roshogolla: Bengal sweet shops to open from Tuesday amid coronavirus lockdown",16,fs23jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fs23jo/sandesh_roshogolla_bengal_sweet_shops_to_open/,10,"A  dessert or a sweet dish is a must after a Bengali meal. Keeping in mind the sweet-tooth of the people of state, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has decided to relax the lockdown rules for the sweets industry.

From Today onwards, sweet shops will remain open between 12 pm to 4 pm to cater to the cravings for something sweet --- maybe a cottage cheese sandesh or syrupy roshogolla -- after a hearty meal.

But why was the chief minister keen on opening the sweet shops?

Apart from her understanding of the Bengali taste buds and the fetish for sweets, Mamata Banerjee is trying to help milkmen and people involved in dairy businesses.

Mamata Banerjee received information that cottage cheese (chhena/paneer) was going to waste after the lockdown and that milkmen were throwing away milk in drains.

With sweet shops being affected by the lockdown, the cottage cheese and milk industry are suffering losses. Hence, Mamata Banerjee's move could be an initiative to help these people carry on their trade.

However, according to political pundits, this initiative will go a long way politically too as it showcases her love for the people of her state and everything that matters to them.

It is not fair to have people with low incomes suffer such financial burden at this time. Anything that can get incomes of people unstuck in this lockdown is good. Oof finally.

Infected person will still spread it! Unless their plan is to kill them instantly üò≤ NDTV reported it's pesticide :/ this not a fucking sanitiser, they used a pesticide , this is criminal and it shows the mental attitude in this country towards the poor. Heartbroken and angry to see them being treated so inhumanly. Other countries have also setup spraying of disinfectant directly on clothes but nothing like this. Why weren't the planeload of NRIs treated the same way if this is the best they can do with large group of people

E: typo I simply wonder why these UP people don't start an uprising like Bolshevik or something against those who rule UP like monarchs ... I mean never seen such inhuman treatments given to its citizens by any state... If only the ones who flew back from abroad and brought the virus to India were 'disinfected' at the airports. But no, they were not. Why? Because the mentality behind such actions by the UP authorities is that poor are 'inferior' and therefore dirty. Whereas the ones coming from abroad are 'superior' and therefore 'cleaner'. It may be pesticides or maybe a sanitary solution they use in other countries

You have to show humanity
Not spray over them like there are  cattles 

If you want to disinfect them then do It in a humane way If they are already infected how will dousing them in pesticides solve the issue? UP folks, you need to have a revolution and overthrow this government that treats you like cattle. This is absolutely medieval and inhuman Pic and headline looks straight out of some dystopian, sci-fi story.

It looks like 
Its a common practice to disinfect groups from unknown origin.

Edit: Not on the road , there should be a facility allocated to this. 
But spraying disinfect is a common practice Looks like India suffers from poorophobia, along with many other phobias :( Hypothermia is not a thing for poor :-( This is just plain stupid. Can you pls change the title ? It's bleach. What the fuck. As if they were objects?? Someone tell them what a disinfectant is-. 

Disinfectants are antimicrobial agents designed to inactivate or destroy microorganisms on inert surfaces. so, they will now die of cancer instead of covid ~~Sanitizer~~
Bleach I saw this video on sky news lol.... Is there evidence this actually works Better to be a cow than human in  UP's ram rajya.Better die and get reincarnated as a cow in UP./s

DM said that orders were  from CM's office.

Remember there were children in crowd too. Kerela did the same at their borders. And people saying it's pesticide-- well, how do you know? Media have their own propoganda. 

A lot of countries did this btw. Let's hope they are all okay. Same thing happened in KERALA
That too in **WAYANAD** 
But no meltdown by these commies and liberals, and NDTV doesn't even report it,
And its a disinfectant and not a pesticide...!
Just because ruling govt is doesn't share same ideology, these guys are running a Big propaganda factory.

You can contribute to CM funds. Also, ensuring that maids, the delivery guy from the local grocery store, plumbers, electricians- if you know any- may need assistance. Reach out to them directly, you wont get a IT benefit though. Or your CM's relief find. If you  don't trust modi no problem.
Just collect money from all non - modi believer in your locality . 
Then buy some rations and try to donate to needy one.

1. Make direct payments to informal workers like maids, drivers, cooks, watchmen, vegetable vendor, etc. There are studies to prove that direct infusion of cash at the bottom of the pyramid helps not only the individual bit also the economy.

2. Make direct payments to healthcare organizations to help them procure masks, ventilators, gloves, personal protective equipment's. Alternatively you can buy some and donate it to nearby hospitals, nursing homes, etc.

3. Donate to CM Relief Fund. They are the ones dolling out relief packages to local economy, pensions, food supply, etc. You can refer to Kerala and Delhi government initiatives to have a better understanding of the work state governments are doing.

4. Also, based on my understanding, the responsibility of healthcare lies with state government and your donations to CM Relief Fund can help pay the extra wages, procurement of medical supplies, etc. can be covered.

I hope this helps brother! Take care and I really appreciate your efforts. 

Also you can point your friends to already existing PM National Relief Fund website (https://pmnrf.gov.in/en/) which has a graph showing year on year income and expenditure and anyone can understand that PMNRF is already sitting on a surplus income from previous years and therefore there was no need to create an additional charitable trust. The income in PMNRF is meant for situations that we are facing today. I showed this graph to my friends to make them understand that at this moment donations to CM Relief Fund is more important than PM ""CARES"". They agreed. Why don't u trust modi?

I found this in a post yesterday. But I'm on mobile and can't find the link to the post. Central government doesn't require money, period! In case of acute shortage they can print money from thin air, thanks to RBI.

State government on the other hand is dependent on central government to release funds and donations it get. **I would recommend donating to state governments especially non-BJP ruled** (BJP one can get from central easily) due to the political scenario. 

It is sad BUT the politicians would be fine seeing more deaths in other states and use it as opportunity.

In case you don't trust any government, go to private organisations, in which I can recommend [Feeding India](https://www.feedingindia.org/). During Kerala floods, there was option via Amazon to select the products (biscuits etc) and donate the quantity.
Is there any similar option for PPE donation etc? Serve humanity around you. Give to reliable NGO rather than giving to distrustful government. What's wrong with PM CARES? Kerala CM or Arvind Kejriwal",2020-03-30 21:52:54

You're misquoting the statement. He said that ""vegetables go through multiple hands before reaching you and thus have higher chances of carrying the virus."" There's a reason most places are constantly being sanitized.

This is also done to impose heavy restrictions so that people don't venture out of their homes in the name of getting vegetables. I can relate. Same situation in Goa. It is yesterday some deliveries started but still shops are shut. Essential scarcity. And they were the ones who were banging plates on the streets Inodori log alag hi level ke chutiye hote hai

You can survive 3 minutes without air.

You can survive 3 hours without shelter.

You can survive 3 days without water.

You can go on 3 weeks without food.

Fortunately, water, shelter and air are in no shortage yet. People are making a fuss about the least important necessity. Just collect whatever you have and ration it into equal portions for a few days. It won't be easy, but the other choice is going out and risking infection.",2020-03-30 12:49:07
Coronavirus,Do you feel coronavirus saga will define a generation?,20,frrt2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frrt2r/do_you_feel_coronavirus_saga_will_define_a/,8,"All the questions and topics here have been practical and related to politics. So I have a query which is rather philosophical in its approach:

This virus has had a traumatic effect on us as a species the likes of which I doubt have ever been seen. Bigger than even WW2 in my opinion. It is ironic since just two months ago I got obsessed with world war 2 and read and researched everything I Could find. The great war changed human psyche in most parts of the world. There are some amazing books--especially ones that tacked the battle of Berlin(random suggestion- lib. gen. rus Cornelius Ryan and Anthony Beevor's books on the final battle which ended with Hitlers death). When the battle finally arrived many berliners were stunned to do anything. Walking around corpses who they talked to a day before, everything was a daze and just breathing was a priveledge that made them smile. It changed the psyche on an individual and collective level. 

This Convid came out of nowhere and left us stunned. The world is locked in and there is palpable fear. What makes it shocking is how just 2 weeks ago evryrthing was so routine. Last month this time I was chilling with my joint pondering which game to play on my PS4. And now it looks like the apocalypse. My house looks different the same locations look surreal. It's like I am in a daze. 

what do you guys think the future is gonna be like? 
Just imagine the day lockdown ends. Taking the bus and trains again. Going to the saloon. Talking to colleagues at work. I can sense it will be surreal on a collective level for all of us. This is collective trauma that the berliners felt when the war reached home but magnified several times for the enemy is the same for all of us. 

What will be the future once (hoping) things resume? Will there be a renewed kindling of all people or we will revert back to the same baloney we were used to?

Surely globalization as a concept will take a hit. The economic recurpussions will be immense. But on an individual level will things be the same as they were pre corona? The frailty of our existence is looking at us squarely in the face.",rishifilmmaker," No I don't think so. 12 million to 18 million (\~5% of population) died in India from the Spanish flu in 1918. But nobody remembers it, there are no novels or poems or personal stories about it either in folklore or in written literature, the independence movement didn't particularly address it in any way. More people today know about jallianwala bagh deaths or WW2 deaths than either the flu deaths or the famine deaths of the 40s or even the more recent 2001 earthquake deaths or the 16K deaths and half a million displaced in 2004 tsunami. For some reason, natural disasters don't seem to dwell for long in social memory. It will... It will change the way we look at our lives and define our lives after this crisis I believe. If it comes back for a second wave after 6-8 months then definitely I think people will be a lot more cautious in transitioning back to how things were before, especially for the first few months after things die down a little. 

But I don't know how much it will affect people. It again will depend on how much you let these things weigh on you. If someone chooses to be ignorant to the whole scenario (however remote something like that may seem), I don't think it would really affect them that much. Only time will tell. Saga?

Coronavirus,Tablighi Jamaat & Covid,23,ftltyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftltyk/tablighi_jamaat_covid/,5,"It was extremely irresponsible for the members of the Tablighi Jamaat to have gathered in light of the covid pandemic. An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they've violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  


Let's look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  


1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  
And this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).
2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat's 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *""all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people"".*   
\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    
\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *""all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people""* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  
\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. 
3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  
In this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don't even have all the facts in the public domain.   
For instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.
4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as ""social distancing"" & ""self-quarantining"" weren't popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   
For instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) 
5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  


While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself.",CuteFaithlessness6," > While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good.

I don't think it is practical to continue a complete lock down post 21 days. It should not be completely lifted as well, but we should have a middle ground.

Say, limited public transport allowed, with a restriction on the number of passengers a bus, train or flight can take. Some non-essential businesses allowed to operate, but work from home wherever possible. Reopening of heavy industries like construction, infrastructure, petrochems, mining & steel etc with only minimum required manning. Continued lockdown of social events and gatherings like cinemas, sporting events etc. Anyone stranded (internationally or within the country) allowed to return home with strict checks in place.

If we don't have some modicum of normalcy returning soon, then the economy is going to fall so far back, that it will take years to get back to where we are. Also, any further lock down and we will see a spike in mental health issues.

All of the above needs to be considered. But then again, it depends on what the situation is after 21 days. If it keeps spiraling out of control, then I fully expect the lock down to continue. 21 days should be fine if every one stays where they are.",2020-03-30 15:06:28

General Facts: 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.

The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.

How it spreads? 
Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.

For Covid-19 [get more info here (Indian Govt.)](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/)

Be safe!

Do the five: 


HANDS Wash them often



ELBOW Cough into it



FACE Don't touch it



SPACE Keep safe distance

Coronavirus,Don't prove social media and messaging platforms to be the next deadly thing during coronavirus crisis!,10,frl7ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frl7ob/dont_prove_social_media_and_messaging_platforms/,0,"Don't prove social media and messaging platforms to be the next deadly thing during coronavirus crisis. I've witnessed a lot of misinformation about the crisis since the last 72 hours, instead of pointing fingers at each other, let's talk some sense here! 

Rumors and misinformation are causing a lot of unnecessary chaos, misunderstanding and unwanted fear amongst already panicking general public! Our healthcare and emergency services are already getting burnt out and these rumors make them lot harder to work for you! Sharing wrongful information and videos can make it go viral across platforms, manipulate the algorithms and direction of the news. Furthermore, these rumors may start to outperform the real news.

If you really want to share some information or videos about coronavirus, it's a humble request to follow these simple steps:

- It's important to know the facts first, but also understand how those around you get the information. Be patient, kind and fact-based.
- If you are the original source of information, think logically if it's the right thing to do and check for facts if you're not sure! Provide all exhaustive details as possible which includes day, date and time, location, names with valid and genuine reasoning. And for god's sake PLEASE STOP politicizing the posts and cause religious outrage, and I'm looking right at you keyboard warriors, just stop ranting let's put science ahead of that nonsense!
- Before you share something on any platform, ask yourself if it‚Äôs constructive for everyone who might see or hear it. Even if you intend to share something with only your friends and family, they might share it as well, and their followers might share it too, then again, can possibly change the direction of the news! 
- Check the source and the source's source for their authenticity, because regardless of whether the information came from your family member, friend, a public official, a celebrity, take the time to analyze it before passing it on or accepting it as fact.
- And even if you think their heart is in the right place, be sure that their information is coming from sources that have a track record of honesty.

The reality of the situation gives us a deep insight into how the majority think with a lack of thought and introspection.
We're all in this together. It's our basic duty to ensure we're all making the sensible decisions and not allowing rumors to take the seed, everyone‚Äôs lives depend on it, thanks!",sagarpachorkar,,2020-03-30 13:48:18

> Yeh aurat Vishkanya ban gayi hai Year 2070- Kanika Kapoor tested positive after 30000th test. first -> necessary. second -> verification

but why would someone retest upto 4 times after having been confirmed? Also, what treatments are available to a covid19 infected? I want to understand the testing policy. 
1. They say we have less tests. Last i heard was some 30 lakhs. 
2. They are testing one person again and again. Shouldn't they wait for the symptoms to subside to check? Like if the symptoms are persisting then isn't it obvious that the person is still positive? >family member says ‚Äòit seems she is not responding to treatment‚Äô

Well, she doesn't have a good track record of responding Ek saal coaching le lo. Phir test lena. If she is still testing positive does that mean she caught the virus after coming back to india? IIRC she came back before holi (10th March) Why is she getting tested again and again? Wasting capacity That's a brittle spirit. Baby doll Corona di! Press ctrl+alt+del...... She will start responding. There are cases that have tested positive for 50 days. Somebody call Ja Rule to make sense in all this! There is no fixed medicine for coronovirus ( the reason for all the issue in the first place). So doctors normally try different combinations of medicines on patients. But what worked for one may not work for another. So as per protocol, after administering medicines you are supposed to check thrice to be 100% sure its gone from the body. Why the fuck is she getting tested again and again? Are every COVID positive patient getting tested again and again like this? Even the treatment knows a chutiya person when they see one. It's not gonna work. Throw her in solitary confinement so she doesn't infect anyone People do realise this is part of every patient's protocol right? It's not like she left the hospital, came back and got tested again. They test every patient at regular intervals to figure out how they're responding to medication. so desperately want to prove its anything but covid-19.

Pull out is not 100% foolproof you imbecile! iss bhosadiwaali ko test karne se accha un migrant workers ko test karo yaar jo delhi se waapis laut rahe hain You need to wait at least 3 weeks before testing again.

If symptoms improve, no need to worry. Testing repeatedly won't solve anything.

Coronavirus,Hard and Swift actions are not the way,6,ftgtxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftgtxy/hard_and_swift_actions_are_not_the_way/,4,"**November 2016**

Modi announced demonitization. There is a panic among people as they rush to ATM and banks to get Rs. 100 notes.

At my hometown my 50 year old mom goes to the bank and spends 3 days in the sun sitting outside the bank to exchange notes so that she can buy groceries. I call her everyday to check on her. I am helpless because no one in my town has ever heard of online transfer.

I defended Modi and his actions. I say people shouldn't panic, Modi government has said there are enough notes and everyone will have their chance.

&#x200B;

**August 2017**

Modi announces GST. Chaos ensues because state and local level VAT/Sales Tax employees are under-trained.

Me and my mom run around the local VAT office pleading officers to exchange our existing compounding VAT license to GST compounding license. But the local babus are unsure. They have been told to show good GST numbers. They wont allow us to ""downgrade"" to compounding even though the limits on compounding is now higher than existing state taxes.

10 days later, exhausted we go to a tax lawyer, pay him hefty fees to go with us to meet the big Tax Babu. He relents and gives us the GSTIN (it was implied that the hefty fees went to pay some bribes).

I defend Modi's action. GST is good for the country. One tax for all. People should support it. State authorities should work with him, not against him.

&#x200B;

**March 2020**

Modi announces full lockdown. Chaos ensues. Our naivety and belief in Modi has cost us. We no longer can find groceries. Every where we find ""organic"" items which are 2-3 times the normal price. Some vegetables cost 3 times more. Drinking water cans costs are up by 10%.

I have lost my job (not due to coronavirus but due to cost cutting). So I spent most of my time at home applying for jobs. Mon-Fri I step out to nearly empty malls/supermarkets to buy stuff. Even then I prefer online groceries because I can't pick up stuff like 8 kgs atta and rice at once. And weekends only to meet friends. My people contact is limited.

I try online groceries for non-organic normal rice and atta. Some are not functional and others cancel my order and take my money. 15k of my money is stuck in such wallets.

I hear rumors of this kirana having stocks of non-organic items. I go there and see people pushing each other. Fear of having nothing to eat means I have to join in. My risk of being infected goes from very less to defcon-1.

I see migrant workers walking 100s of kms back to home and can't help but see the repeat of demonitisation. 

I see businesses (local and ecom) and I can't help but see a repeat of GST. 

It just seems 3 years the government has not learned anything. 

And I can no longer defend Modi's ""swift and heavy handed"" actions.

&#x200B;

Some might say - It is people who are causing panic. I agree. But what has Modi's government learned from the chaos and panic during demontization? They should have anticipated this rush and talked with the state authorities, ask them to train local authorities and formulate a plan. 

Some might say - It is state government's fault because they are responsible for local level jurisdiction. I agree. But the last minute rush at kirana stores show that local authorities had no warning at all. Also, why did they think an apparatus which failed to implement a smallish GST (comparative numbers) rollout can handle a big change like this?

Some might say - Well state government had initiated lockdowns way before Modi. That is also true. Though the fact is each government was handling as they saw it. In many states, mostly malls were closed. With time states would've realized what to do and slowly locked down. Shutting down all at once has created confusion as the local police doesn't know the difference between this lockdown and 144 curfew because they are obviously ill-equipped to handle it. 

It seems Modi's government rides on the fact that if majority of people believe their actions are just and swift:

""Demontization is good because it removes black money""

""GST is good because it creates uniform taxation""

""Lockdown is necessary because it will slowdown coronavirus""

they don't need to plan anything. They can appeal to people's conscious and get away with it.

Planning  is not in their dictionary. While this kind of behavior might have worked for past 2 times, this time it is going to hurt lakhs of people. 

And lastly, while I think this is mostly due to government's ineptitude, us Indians have a role to play in too. We for some inexplicable reason believe in ""swift and heavy handed"" action forgetting that any such action has serious unintended consequence. 

You cannot browbeat something into existence. 

All of us - who support such heavy handed actions have migrant workers blood on our hands. We need to look inside and ask ourselves - Do we really have any compassion left? And no, donating to PM CARES doesn't show your compassion. 

Start by saying no to any ""swift and heavy handed"" action.",truindian-follower," About Sweden, it's really bad Worst part is we believe those so called swift and ""heavy action'' which actually is blatant abuse of power is only way out and is actually good for us.
Anyone going out to buy food is criminal.
People walking homes after having lost their lives are criminals.

What happened to that value based cultural system which was best in the world.
When did we start justifying abuse.
We did public apathy to such practices became too main stream.
When did we forgot to question the government.
Why are we too blind to see that the ones  who actually are hurt in this are common people.

And also, NO. Donating food or money to someone who earns it isn't humanity. People who earned their meals with their sweat and blood  would loose a part of their soul eating that food out of hunger.

We never treated them right or respected them.
Never provided them proper wages and fair prices.

Servitude is ingrained in majority.
We are the biggest bunch of hypocrites.

I know lockdown was necessary to buy time for our medical infrastructure but it had to be planned by those secretaries (UPSC passed are considered smartest lot here)  and government.
