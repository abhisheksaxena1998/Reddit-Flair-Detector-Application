Politics,Pitting a community against a political party is fucking stupid.,194,futac9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/futac9/pitting_a_community_against_a_political_party_is/,73,"First of all let me start by saying it was stupid whatever some muslims did at nizamuddin and still are doing by staying hidden and not letting the authorities do their work efficiently. 

But this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. No BJP does not represent Hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. Bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. Regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. What part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. Everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

Had to get this off my chest, sorry, and thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

If you have any objections to what i have said, i can conversate or debate sanely but please stop the craziness, use your brains i don't care what your parents, uncle aunties believe in, use your own brains otherwise India is not gonna stay a democratic country, and this is not even a baseless fact anymore, it's all around us, we just close our eyes to look around.",chillinvillain122," Our country is just too far in at the moment and there's no turning back now, our best hope is to believe that we make it to the other side without taking too much damage.

Something much worse than the 2002 riots is ahead of us, it always was but now with the Covid-19 situation acting as a catalyst we are going to reach there sooner. A couple of points

1. I think India is inherently fragile. BJP has not invented something, they are just leveraging the pre existing fault lines. Another thing is that there are so many people who vote for BJP because they are so fed up with the opposition. 

I don’t know exactly but Rahul Gandhi wouldn’t get a lot of crowd in my tiny village. 

2. A substantial part of this country do not care about democracy. People don’t like having to make difficult decisions.

Don’t consider this as a debate to your points, just my PoV. BJP stands for divisive politics. In a state where the minority is a majority they play the outsider insider politics. A place where the majority is the majority the play the caste wala card. BJP is being run like an efficient political business so i don't see when and how it can be stopped. If you kill in the name of religion, your God has already forsaken you.           
- Unknown Though I appreciate what you are saying, Majority of the people are just too naive and uneducated to understand what you are saying.
Lack of Education and awareness is the root cause of divisive politics based off of religion. Your actions show your real motives, not your words. going by your logic, there is no real reason Muslim women should vote for congress as they were the ones opposing triple talaq and it was bjp who made it into law In the US, you say ""Chinese Virus"" and people will call your a racist. 

In India, you say ""Corona Jihad"" you're a nationalist. 

And people say India will soon become a superpower. My ass. If you pay attention, India is becoming the next Pakistan. The only Job of a political party is to stay in power no matter what they have to do for it.
I don't think BJP is at fault, the people of India are at fault. Fuck BJP. Fuck Religious people. Dalits dream of becoming a mainstream Hindu someday where they are treated equally, so they will do what they are told. They forget that they will never be accepted as equal. They are in for a rude awakening >  and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes

Because they don't understand how Hinduism promotes Brahminical supremacism, which implies oppression of people like them. That's why they are, and their ancestors before them were, and their descendants will be, dalits!

You can't expect everyone to be as woke as Ambedkar who understood how Hinduism is oppressive to Hindu lower castes. The same people conveniently ignore the numerous Hindu Festivals The reason dalits support bjp is because the rss recruit them at a very young age. Rss targets the vulnerable as in the poor. The poor mostly consists of sc/st. And as such the rss sink their claws into them at a very young age. They're brainwashed by the age they can make decisions on their own they are set in their own ways. This isn't the case for all sc/st some do luckily get away.

>The coronavirus is waging a war of attrition against health care workers throughout the world, but nowhere is it winning more battles at the moment than in Italy and in Spain, where protective equipment and tests have been in severely short supply for weeks.

>**On Wednesday, the number of medical personnel infected was nearly 6,500 nationally**, health authorities said, representing 13.6% of the country's 47,600 total cases and about 1% of the health system's workforce. At least three health care workers have died.

>**In Italy, where nearly one-tenth of more than 74,000 infections are among medical workers, doctors and nurses have been begging the government daily to provide more masks, gloves and goggles**.

Remember China created new production lines for wuhan, and most of China is coming out of total quarantine while we are going into one. 5 baje thaliyan bajao I don't understand the people of this country at all. They're the same ones that beat the shit out of doctors when something happens because of a lack of supplies. While also using them as scapegoats for thali bhajao bla bla. It's the same with the army. Use them whenever you want to further some sympathy argument but treat them like shit. Wait, so was the complaint legitimate or not? The article isn't clear on this. According to other tweets, the first doctor apparently posted some sort of retraction as well to her claim. Was this under coercion or a misunderstanding from her?

Alt News should probably do an investigation on this topic, as their fact-checking seems to be more rigorous. everyone is silenced.... only JenocideJumlaman speaks. Chutiyon ki kami nahi We respect doctors by endangering their lives.Government should provide ample PPEs to doctors and people should understand that these people are not just endangering their own lives by fighting this epidemic, but their loved ones too and still they are choosing to fight.

Imagine if we send our soldiers in a war without armor or weapons, will we win the war or lose it.This is the same situation that we are in right now.Doctors neither have the weapon or the armor to wage this war for long and this is going to be a long drawn fight.
Also, doctors would be jailed and their license revoked if they refuse to work under these unsafe conditions. We do not need to piss off our medical health services personnel - that should be the rule in best of times, but more so in current circumstances. We are cheap knockoff of China now I would say so what , Doctors go thorugh quite a ragging still . Have the thick skin , thse chutiya social media trolls won't save your life infact it's the other way round. 

Ideally all students/Docs across state should request the CM to procure it . This is the time Or maybe they were spreading fake news and on being called out, they deleted their accounts.

People who have truth on their side and are literally fighting a war with their lives at stake, got cowered by a few trolls?

And PPE is in short supply as the global demand shop up like crazy.",2020-03-26 20:17:25
Politics,A new political party gave a full front page ad in a popular newspaper today in Bihar,728,ff8sth,https://i.redd.it/yjo9wpy38el41.jpg,146,,aaluinsonaout," This looks like an IIPM ad 1. Where did they get funds for such full page ads? 
2. What is the use of English ads in such demographic (Not implying that Biharis cannot read English, but for masses Hindi would have been much better) A party with the name 'plurals' claiming to be progressive with a symbol of a ~~unicorn~~  pegasus In BIHAR. It ticks all the boxes for a ridiculous defeat. [deleted] Looks like some scientology type shit Lol. This is hilarious. Being a Bihari, I totally appreciate the humour in this. Plulols! Kaun jaat ki hai ye?

*Baaki sab dhua hai dhua* Political party Kam koi obnoxious cult jaisa LG rhi hai What a fucking joke. That's not how elections are won. Look at kanhaiya kumar that guy is continuously addressing the masses. Been in top 20 most influencal men on Times. The crowd gathered is humongous and he's not even a mla. That's how you win an election. First of all no use of ad in English in bihar. Even people who know English won't see you as an alpha male/female if you act all high and mighty in such demographic. Bhihar needs someone who can bow down rub dirt on his cut and carry on. Not I join you or I fight along with you. 

But 

You join me  in my fight ... cool.

Looks like 

One more rich kid on the block with illusions of bringing change with top to bottom approach. 

I dont have much info on her. Please correct me if im wrong. CV mein badiya lagega yeh. Looks like a well funded research project. felt cute, opened a party, might get few urban votes later Prashant Kishore planning to release independent parties just like this in every state https://www.pushpampc.com/home.aspx

Alright, which one of you is Pushpam? Chaudary ki chori chunav lad rahi hai. Kuch angrezi ka naam hai party ka. Udne wale ghode ka button daba dena bus. There is a website, smartphone app, big mission statements and demands for donations.

And yet, just lists current problems & their (her) plan to 'challenge' the system.
That's it. No real plan of action or agenda for change.

Just another fresh political science graduate with freshly read ideas from a Karl Marx book. Props to the guy who came up with the Unicorn/Pegasus thing. A little humour in politics is always appreciated. People who are mocking her, should not forget who our PM is and how he became PM. A whole lot of educated mass became ""zombie bhakt""

This party needed attention and look like she is getting a lot of attention with this advertisement. 1) people are shitting on this add by saying that they'll never win. Why ? This is a democracy, people complain about dynasty politics but when people try to break there's hue and cry. 

2) people are not really talking about this persons qualifications or the qualifications of the members of the party ? Are they the iipm of politics or do they really mean it ? What are their promises in the manifesto ? Red & Black. Nice Wow......
That's a new take for any political party......
Won't succeed though unless they reach the ground massess......
Otherwise it is absolutely nothing...... Is this anime party with that unicorn? This is cringy as fuck and the party sounds like a fucking cult More power to her!!! Lol... Looks like it is just her from reading the website.  Where do they get the funding for this? There was a Mahila Empowerment Party that sprung up during the Karnataka election also. 'Plurals' is kinda tongue twister word. Slightly difficult to pronounce for even folks who are comfortable with English. Baqi logon ki baat door ki hai. optimism? The symbol of the party looks like a freaking Wine Company's symbol lmao... This is what happens when you watch a few seasons of House of Cards and decide to start your own political party. ..and she even declared herself a CM candidate already lol r/im14andthisisdeep r/iamabadass r/madlads Strong Mahila empowerment party vibes Woah! Everything about this is weird as fuck. Plus that stare screams evil and makes me uncomfortable. I like their Hindi font. Did some digging, its apparently [Poppings](https://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/poppins) Chutiya Samaj party would still be a better political party name then plurals Sasti Bloomberg Ad looks too progressive for Bihar demographic.

Not insulting Biharis can't be progressive, just saying about general demographic Looks like am low budget TV series poster.

Also the name is dumb. You want to win in India's most backward state with Plurals as party name? Seriously? Okay you got our attention...can we have her for AMA ? Is the party symbol unicorn? LMAO! Wtf....Bihar is one of the top illiterate states aur inki audicity ki CM candidate bhi declare kr Diya.
Bhala kisko samajh aayega There's one main issue with this ad. If you Google plurals you don't get anything about this party . As a digital marketer I'm baffled by their strategy of choosing such a poor name for the party On women's day.. Very apt This rooks like a ""The Room"" remake with female lead instead of Tommy Wissieu I rather place my bet on seeing pig with wings. I'm skeptical of any political party and corporation. Don't think this party has any chance of winning anything in Bihar. Doesn't ring any bells with the voters. Though I appreciate the effort.

Visited the place recently. It's literally like traveling back in time. The people are conservative af. Women are expected to behave in a certain manner, do everything for all the members of the family, eat last and what not.

And as far as the political part goes, I got the feel that it's more about the change in the attitude of the people than just the ruling party. The places are super duper polluted. Like the whole city was a dumpyard. Litter everywhere. Dusty air. No wonder two of the major cities of Bihar featured in the top 15 most polluted cities of the world. 
The roads were bad, yes but there was literally no road sense. People drove on both sides of road, no regard for any traffic rules. And the honking was directly proportional to the acceleration. Literally blow your brains out noise on the road. Yeah... no... ""Plurals"" won't resonate with the masses in *any* state. If you have waste time explaining what your party's name even means... then you've lost half the campaign battle already. Shieeeet. Saw this in the morning but didn’t care to read anything and flipped the page thinking it’s a soap opera/news channel ad. (Not that they are different ) Why does this looks like a cult? This is weird. She's a London based daughter of Binod Chaudhary, a JDU leader. 

Answers a lot of questions regarding funding. This is basically like what OnePlus is to Vivo/Oppo. Looks Promising... She is JD(U) leader Vinod Chaudhary's daughter. No wonder why she came into politics. 

Link: https://shrts.in/bJV9 Saw her educational qualification, atleast she has credibility to become a CM unlike the remaining bozos. Even though i know her laptop promise is 100% fake, i would still vote for her. The chances of her making rash and stupid decisions are really less compared to the other bozos. Also, the chances of her making calculated and logical decisions for the benefit of people is really high. Hope she improves her marketing though. No offense but she looks like a snake,that smile atleast! Eeeeee plurarls kaa hota hai ??? Is it April 1st already? This colour scheme is not working. She looks she's back after having sold her soul to the devil. Yeah right, you are going to win Bihar with a english language ad.


1st step to form a political party in Bihar is to pick a caste (or few aligned castes)

2nd step, is to rope in some bahubalis.

3rd step, is to use whatever leverage your party gets, to make money. C'mon Bihar give us the experience of being a Super Power's Neighbour . From Nepal . I'll let her deal with my snake. Pehle caste bataiye
Phir ideology bataiye
Phir ye bataiye ki opening propaganda kya hoga

Aap chronology ko samajhiye In Russia Putin pays for certain opposition campaigns to run .  Gives him opportunity to claim they are all sorts of things.  Will have to see how this plays out but looks like her Jdu votebabk isn’t very important for all parties Plurals HAVE arrived. Sounds as apolitical and sanghi as AAP.",2020-03-08 14:36:11

He did great work while he was at Ajmer. Made history as the only non-Muslim candidate to win a majority from Tonk Rajasthan against a muslim candidate.

There are a few administrative officers in Bangalore who are doing a good job as well Late Manohar Parrikar.
The guy was the reason my entire village supported BJP in 2014 election. He had his own views and he never compromised with that. Even at the time of rafel he was the one from BJP to oppose modi-shaha. That's why he was transferred to Goa again. He is the best BJP CM any indian state ever got. He backed beef traders. He restricted spread of Christianity  behind social service mask. But maintained good relationship with people .

Politics,"In this trying time, let's try to be a little less nationalist/political/racist and a bit more human.",213,flm79b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/flm79b/in_this_trying_time_lets_try_to_be_a_little_less/,56,"I had a shocking interaction this morning. A bunch of us (various nationalities) were sitting around discussing the news, and one of my fellow indian girls was telling us about a video she saw. A young Pakistani student in China had posted it saying that air India had evacuated the Indian students in his Chinese university and that no one was coming for him. 

There was apparently an overwhelming amount of support from fellow students asking air India to evacuate all students irrespective of race. 

I mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. And the girl said ""Pakistan isn't equipped to deal with this virus. They aren't equipped to deal with a viral fever. They could all die.. and it would be a good thing if they were all wiped out."" 
I have never felt more shocked. 

Irrespective of historical politics between our nations, hoping for an entire country to die out is horrible. This is a global pandemic and the best time to set aside all our biases and support everyone. Everyone has loved ones who we're worried about. We are all susceptible to the virus just as much as every other race. 

Let's put aside religion and take care of each other.

I'm probably going to get some hateful comments about this post anyway. But I don't care. This is me imploring that we all stand together (at a social distance, no touchy) and try to keep ourselves and our neighbors safe. Thanks for coming to my TED talk",ThatRedScooter," What an incredibly narrow minded person. Our great grandfathers were from the same nation. People in Pakistan are humans too. I personally hate both Pakistani and Indian governments but that hate shouldn’t be transferred to the people under them. Meanwhile in the Zee News Cinematic Universe:-

She said this in front of people from other nations too ? She is living abroad, did she never shop in a Pakistani shop (half the so called ""Indian shops"" are run by Pakistanis, at least here in Europe) or interact with Pakistanis abroad?

I would understand if someone within India says that, because lets face it, with the current political atmosphere in India, that would not be surprising at all. But living abroad and saying shit like this is... she is a horrible person. [deleted] [Here ya go, another thread. It is a lost cause.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/flmmps/man_riding_motorcycle_beaten_up_in_maharashtras/) I am in two minds about this.

I do feel that we shouldn't in general dehumanize people. It *seems* grossly unfair. The wars and games between our ruling classes shouldn't destroy our humanity as individuals.

But there's also this angle: the members of a tribe (religion, nation, race, caste, ethnicity, etc.) need to be aware that the tribe's harmful actions towards others will exact a toll on them individually. For instance, if members of caste A are especially casteist and/or communal, then individuals from that group should feel the heat for it from others, even if the individual himself or herself may not be casteist or communal. Otherwise they will have that much less incentive ""fix"" their tribespeople.

I have used this principle with respect to myself. If I am hated because members of my ""tribe"" exhibit certain undesirable behaviors, then while I may not ""deserve"" it, I certainly should realize that the reaction is expected, natural, and even healthy, in a way. It gives me an incentive to fix the harmful actions of my fellow tribespeople. Hating or punishing the members for the transgressions of their tribe is a normal strategy used in tribal calculus. It may not be healthy individually or collectively to suppress this ancient instinct. Just like our instincts for revenge and sexual jealousy, it might exist for a reason. r/ABCDesis If the government allow us :). > and that no one was coming for him.

ha he'd most likely be better off staying in China Is that what they call trying Humanism? Brother you are preaching to the wrong crowd. You need to post this to other hateful subs. >	I mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. 

The problem with these things is that they're usually expected to only go one way. It's only Indians who are expected to bend over backwards and consider humanity and finer human values, Pakistanis are never expected to return the gesture. 

Support for fellow men would also require the Pakistanis to stop sponsoring the terrorists who kill Indian civilians. At this point terrorists have killed more Indians than covid-19 has (though I expect that equation may change in a few weeks) and yet Pakistan continues to actively support terrorists.

Things have gotten to a point where despite being on the FATF grey list, which hurts their economy, they continue to support it. They're willing to let their country burn if it means Indians will die. When you have that kind of hatred emanating from that side, you can expect it to be reciprocated.

FWIW, I'd prefer for India to evacuate all students as long as the logistics allow it. What do we do after that though is an open question. Will Pakistan take back these students or simply dump them on India to treat/quarantine? Remember this is a nation that refused to accept the bodies of its own army men during Kargil, and the army is basically the organization that runs the country. It's still morally the better option and so we should have done it, but let's not bring in all these ideas of support for fellow men which only ever go one way. Nice virtue signaling Wrong sub my man. I mean there is always this one dickwad in convos like these. > Pakistan isn't equipped to deal with this virus. They aren't equipped to deal with a viral fever. They could all die.. and it would be a good thing if they were all wiped out.

Politics,AAP’s woeful response to the Delhi communal violence reflects the limit of its welfare politics,211,fd7q3z,https://scroll.in/article/954991/aaps-woeful-response-to-the-delhi-communal-violence-reflects-the-limit-of-its-welfare-politics,45,,Dumma1729," So the argument is that the DMs could have commanded the police or the armed forces but didn't. The DMs didn't do that or that's what's being said. Also, there was no formal request from AAP. 

What does AAP have to say about it? I'm sure someone would have asked it of them. That's not it. What he did was deliberate. His silence on genocide and granting permission to police against Kanhayia.

He was expected to be on ground to protest against the genocide, he didn't even held a press conference against it.

This all was a message to gain more votes, he want's to expand and don't want to lose any votes he can score on, even if people who support bhagwa terrorism. He made it clear that he is not against muslim genocide so that he can be more popular.

He is a **snake**

His primary motive is his political carrier, not what he projects, the idea of being anti-corruption and righteous. 

If not criticized he had no problem playing the caste politics, *mai baniya hu mujhe vote do*. His rajya sabha nomination are also shady It was pretty clear he sold RS seat for money like BSP does , Also they both share same caste as Kejriwal.

[OPINION | Arvind Kejriwal Sold Rajya Sabha Seats for Money: Mayank Gandhi](https://www.news18.com/news/opinion/opinion-arvind-kejriwal-sold-rajya-sabha-seats-for-money-mayank-gandhi-1621639.html)

[In AAP Settling For 2 Guptas For Rajya Sabha, A Debt And Thank You Note](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-aap-settling-for-2-guptas-for-rajya-sabha-a-debt-and-thank-you-note-1796021)

And above all we should not forget why people left AAP on first place : There is no AAP it's AK, the party itself is pretty anti-democratic,  Arvind Kejriwal does not allow anyone to come forward other than him, their is no ideology just AK himself.

But my problem is something bigger than that, my problem is the fact that indians no matter their political inclination they all tend to be **Bhakts** Just like sanghies blindly support Narendra/BJP we have their counter part here too who are blind bhakts of AK. We should be neutral and chose whatever is best, even if you vote for them you should not become bhakt for them. 

Throughout the history of india indians have done this and it always result into disaster, we should follow our own moral compass not our *führer.* At the end of the day, their priority is keeping the power and money. Everything else is secondary or for the show. >""woeful response to the Delhi communal violence reflects the limit of its welfare politics""

The reason ""communal violence"" is propagated on the population by a political party is primary due to lack of proper education.....AAP is focusing on providing proper education. 

The only thing AAP could of had done differently was AAP MLA's going to the streets and sitting right in the middle of the road where the riots was happening. 

And you know what would of had happened to them if they did that; they would of been killed on the spot. The reason for this is that the riots were started by men brought in from UP. BJP learned from the Gujarat riots not to use locals. 

They would of been killed the same way Congress EX MP Ehsan Jafri was murdered in 2002 Gujarat riots 

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/The-five-men-who-killed-Ehsan-Jafri/article14427953.ece

*The five accused who have been convicted for lynching the former MP are Yogendrasinh Shekhawat, Jayesh Jingar, Krishnakumar, Jayesh Parmar and Naran Tank. All of them were sentenced to life impriosnment for 14 years.* True, AK didn't show courage during the riots, but I don't think he could have controlled them without the police. The most he could have done is some noise. AAP has 62 MLAs.
We know the police are not under their control, but all of those 62 have got at least 10 security guards.
If they all would have gone together with their protection force on the day of events, at least those 620 would have protected few lives. Assuming the police guards feel ashamed in front of the minister to act.

But all of those 62 chose to sit and enjoy Twitter. Mob of both the sides was out their in numbers..its was communal frenzy. What can AAP will do. If riots continued for 3 days in a national capital means police stand downed. Lets be honest kapil mishra is not a big leader to go this far unless he had the blessings of amit shah. More and more anti CAA protests are taking place and riots is to instill fear in em that's why all that happened and police dont have the orders to stop it What has happened is that BJP, by crying about identity politics the loudest, has made sure all other parties are now shy to be seen as engaging in identity politics. In this way they have made sure that all parties have ceded ground to them and they can now play identity politics themselves to their heart's content. If a party can win 54% of the votes in a city, it has the political capital to intervene. Who knows, maybe a big supporter backed intervention and a ""call for peace"" movement could have become a launchpad for kejri on the national scene again. One possibility is that AAP was not prepared how to handle this. They have learnt to suppress their natural instincts and now they do things while keeping the brand imagery in mind. Due to that, they couldn't decide in time on what their next step should be branding wise and by then the ship had already sailed. [deleted]",2020-03-04 12:36:24

After the first Delhi shootings, Arnab Goswami and Republic TV were trying to spin it as the act of a simple, 'provoked' Indian with the hashtag #StopProvokingIndia. If a peaceful protest is apparently deserving of a violent response, then why bother with politeness? Call a spade a spade and a fascist a fascist. Where would you draw the line? Completely agree with her. The rules of the game have changed. As long as we are NOT provoking or encouraging violence, these tactics are fine to counter hate mongers like Arnab and others. cue the RW now bemoaning ""hawwww Liberal Bollywoodiya bAdDd!!!""

edit: the responses on the ""other discussions"" sub are pure gold, as expected. I agree. In a state where situation is so bad that 'journalists' berate the people of an entire state for making their choice (which he doesn't agree with) in an election, on national TV, politeness has no role to play.

Being ""impolite"" to BJP supporters isn't going to change their minds. It will infact further polarize them to the right.

We are supposed to come up with a strong national level alternative to BJP/Modi, simply abusing them and their supporters isn't going to cut it. we need to be careful in speaking about politics in our country. Why do I feel like these people are playing straight into the BJP's hands and dividing people further. We need better people representing leftist ideologies.

Edit: sorry I meant liberal ideologies. Not leftist. Just imagine a Muslim person saying this and adding allah ho akbar to it lol Well said. Every individual with conscience should speak up. Enough of hatred spread. Agreed I don't agree with this, if you talk about Gandhi on one side and do this on another. Quite hypocritical and disrespectful to Gandhi https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/supreme-court-shaheen-bagh-protest-public-road-block-1644938-2020-02-10 This will cause nothing but further divide. Ah yes.... The great political analyst, economist, environmentalist, tech mogul, Swara Bhasker is always right. attention crazy , deprived of work, career at stake,  politics as career in mind, All this has already been said and done by leftists. The fundamental problem is that they are always enraged and never patient or calm. I pity on you, I really do. Rightists are no gods. They are idiots too. Downvote, report, do whatever the hell you want. This left vs right drama needs to stop. This has come down to people's ego now. While the poor in the interiors of the country suffer, these protests do no good to them. Be it Modi, Shah, Kamra or Swara, everyone just needs to shut up now. Why she a thing on Reddit? This is not Twitter or your family group. r/India needs better standards. What next? Kartik Aryan on economy? Karan Johar on space-tech? [removed] Aww Swara baby got no chills In my opinion she is a failed actor and she needs to fuck right off  she has no work in her hand . I don't like the way she incites listeners to engage in arguments with our elders. 

I want to improvise that if you think there will be tangible benefits to it, only then do it, otherwise don't let her cause ideological divides within your family.

Also, hate the way she's shaking her head, my intuition is that she is trying to cash in on the heated sentiments she is rousing and this is not something heartfelt. Swara is a fame craving bitch irrespective to whichever side you lean to.",2020-02-10 12:51:10

Politicians back then had a teeny weeny bit of morality and shame. 

If you did something bad you were chastised and made to resign from your post in fear of the public but these days, even if you openly call for discrimination and violence of a community you will not only be rewarded with a Y-level security but also the public approval. 

Hindutva/ communal polarization is one helluva drug. To be honest, while Nehru was open to criticism, and he supported Shanker over his cartoons, it was Indira's Emergency that shut down Shanker's Weekly. 

I saw the final issue of the magazine and they had a fun cartoon showing Nehru and Indira with the subtle inclination of start and end Your question assumes that these cartoonists worked under similar political and social conditions as today. Because 40 years ago, such a question wouldn’t even come up. It just didn’t occur to us then. Discounting the brief period of the Emergency, society and the political discourse was far freer and a lot more tolerant. The political class had a sense of humour, and even laughed at themselves now and then at cartoons that lampooned them. 

Times have changed, my friend. Regardless of whether some may feel insulted, it’s the sad truth that society and the political class today are a LOT more intolerant.

I don't doubt they will get votes. Indian voters are getting tired of BJP too. But we don't have a real alternative. Congress is spineless, the same MPs that were in Congress jumped ship to BJP when given the chance, and they will come back to Congress if BJP doesn't do good. He is not very mature and has made a lot of mistakes and unnecessary enemies along the way and hence losing credibility. 

However, he has shown an impressive amount of learning and improvement. It will take time for him to build credibility at national level and hopefully he gets better with time. I dont live in Delhi but hear from my friends stories of good governance by him. As for freebies, socialist programs from a surplus government don't hurt anyone and are good for everyone in long run. Telling from personal experience. /r/enlightenedcentrism, but unironically. AAP is the same, Kejriwal has grown

He isn't the same idiot who complained 24 hrs about BJP and Modi

That's what they should do. Keep up the good work and not fall in the traps of Hindutva. I am sure AAP will and should return to run Delhi going forward. I honestly have faced no difference but whenever I interact with maids, security guards, Uber drivers, etc., it feels like their welfare schemes have genuinely helped them. I don't think I am in any position to criticise any of them.

AAP has surely improved the quality of education in Government schools bringing in better infrastructure, more engaging parent interactions, etc.

They should not align with INC, BJP, BSP, SP, etc., because all these parties have had a history, at some point or the other, of corruption. It will take years for AAP to gain the footing of even SP or BSP but I don't see that as a bad thing. And support the abrogation of Article-370 and abolishing the statehood of Kashmir while demanding the same for Delhi. Nice touch AAP please bring French secularism to India. i love kejriwal ❤️ I don't think Kejriwal's ideology is issue for any voter. It will take some skills and a control on ego to spread beyond Delhi. Till now AAP hasn't managed to build presence in any other metro which would happily accept his brand of politics. They are literally just Congress that can implement schemes.

They pander to the times with no real ideology. It works as long as you keep delivering.

They are center right not center He is a populist. Today i'll take him over anyone in the country because he is way better than others however i don't think his policies of distributing freebies will work in long term. This is perfect centrism- enabling fascism. 🔔

He is as opportunistic as one politician can get, its just he is going one extra mile on development that's why he bit bearable!

He asked for proof on Balakot air strike. He stayed away from JNU & CAA protests cause Delhi elections were near and he didn't wanted any controversy. He is still 'anti-national' liberal and opportunistic politician. Indian Bernie Sanders.",2020-02-03 13:59:53

My boyfriend is from India and I am American.
He’s told me that in India, it’s rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

How can I politely refuse food if I am full? Is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? Thanks!",keylimepie1123," ""Aaj mera upwas hain""

Just learn this phrase Feel free to refuse. A lot of Indians don’t understand boundaries and therefore it’s upto you to have one.  It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I understand what you're trying to express, I used to be in a similar state by being an overeater/emotional overeater. Especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required. You could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them.

1. You could express yourself, and open yourself to them, so they wouldn't push you any further 
2. Pretend to be ""full"" before you actually are, so when they do stuff your plate with more foods, you don't feel sick. 
Or. 
3. As soon as you're done, you run to the kitchen to leave your plate. (Wouldn't really just that, but the idea was somewhat funny.)

Hope it helps! Besides, if they care for you, (as we try to show our affection by feeding others), they'd understand what you're going through and wouldn't be offended. 

Hope this helps! Tell them you are allergic to  carbs and vegetable oil. 

big chunk of options  will be taken off the shelf . One trick that works for me is: say you are full well before you are. They will push to eat some more, refuse it a couple of times and then have it :) Things not to do in life:

>Visit India when you are recovering from an eating disorder.

None of the advice people giving you on this sub will work when you are gonna see so much Delicious stuff and you would want to try each and every one of those. 

> How can I politely refuse food if I am full? 

You start saying ""I'm full"" when you have eaten 50% of what you want to eat! Just say ""Ewww"" at hit the hand holding the plate. ^/s Just say that you are stuffed and mentioned that you loved it. Usually works. I don’t smoke so whenever somebody offers or forces me a cigarette, I say “I just had one before coming here” haha Simple and short. Stay drama free. Put your foot down and say ""No, THANK YOU!""

Stay drama free and simple. Repeat
Say ""No, Thank You"" Arre nahi aunty pet bhar gaya aur nahi kha sakhti 

Sach main aunty pet full ho gaya. 


Isse teen chaar bar bol dijye. Tell them you or on a fast. Simple as that  just ask for a glass of water when they offer food

It works out for me Just say 'pehle aap lijiye'. Just say that you had a very late previous meal. For eg, if you're invited over dinner, tell them that you had a very late lunch. nahi chahiye ji. any karl rock fans up in this bitch?",2020-03-29 12:45:42
Politics,Comic about current political scenario,184,fgufeq,https://i.redd.it/fejjkle4i0m41.jpg,21,,dlisfyn," If Mahatma Gandhi would have been alive he would beat the shit out of these people with his walking stick. First of all, an Indian with half a brain would not utter pro Pakistan slogans on a stage. Whatever she was trying  to say there was an obvious miscommunication from her side. Didn't Owaisi and co stop her too in the stage. Why glorify that What is ""AADAB""? Tbh, she shouldn’t have uttered Pakistan word. It always leads to messy consequences, rightly so or otherwise IMO the people who actually make statements like ""Jinnah Waali Aazadi"" or ""Alag desh"" or ""Tukde-tukde"" should be the ones prosecuted first. Such statements deeply malign all the struggle and hardships our freedom fighters had to endure. The very same struggle, which has now, near 74-years later, enabled us to live on with our lives with much more independence and freedom than available back during the days of war.

As for ""Pakistan Zindabaad"", I'd say it's a dumb and a pointless statement to say the least. Dare I say it, in almost every aspect; geopolitical, social, economical- we've excelled over them. So there's no point in spreading half-truths like these. We should first concern ourselves over the issues plaguing *our* society, and later fret about how better/ worse we are compared to other states.

And no, such people shouldn't certainly be jailed- can't comment about sedition charges, but whenever we've to talk about development or progress as such, we give comparisons to first world countries. Does that insinuate us becoming ""pro-first"" world-ism? Why doesn't anybody say, ""Go to Sweeden"" or similar things then?

This entire narrative of Nationalist/ Urban Naxal being manipulated is rendering immense harm to our country, Let supreme, high and session courts shut themselves down and tadipar gang start khap panchayet in every block. Why waste tax payer's money on sinking titanic.

Some are ambiguous -

I'm unsure if I'm supposed to comment on whether billionaires should exist or whether I think billionaires earned money by working hard.

Some questions have an inherent bias -

Can you please help me understand why isn't this test one such scheme with the added benefit that you even get the data about peoples political leanings. I get it that you're giving the option to people to enter the fake IDs and have results DMed to them.

Convenient activism It amazes me that no one is even willing to entertain the idea that these goons were actually sent by the Congress/opposition. Given the corruption and lack of morals on both sides of the aisle, this needs to at least be considered as an explanation for who these goons were. What does the government in power have to gain by doing this? They already have the police to do their dirty work for them.

If congress want to come back to power. They have to let go of the family thinking and choose a strong leader and a great speaker. Apparently people in India do not go after education and qualifications in a leader. Majority just want a leader who can give long buttery and dreams speeches. Nice :) Frankly speaking, we never gave Rahul Gandhi a chance. We always ridiculed him because of his errors while speaking. And soon, everybody started thinking of him as a joke. I'm not saying he would have been a good or a bad leader, but we never even saw him as one. I cam to this realisation a while ago of how many people don't clear their interviews because of their  communication skills. Same thing happened with this guy, but at a massive level. The smooth talker got the job, but doesn't know what to do XD

PS: Not a congress supporter, just my observation. To survive in politics one need to be ruthless. Rahul is lacking that. That is a flaw with the existing political set up. But unfortunately political commentators are considering that as a negative trait. Because most of them expect a leader to be a dictatorial monarch.

I oppose Congress's policies. Not a big fan of Rahul. But somehow I have a soft corner for him and believe that he is a honest person. What a good man.. might not be a good politician, but definitely a good man India doesn't deserve a Prime Minister like Rahul.

India deserves Modi.

We have so badly ruined our politics that it seems 'unnatural' to us when a politician shows decency and kindness. Everyone here is like 'He is too good of a human being to be a good politician'. 

Take a moment to see just how messed up that is. RG lost his closest family members at a young age. He never tried to gain emotional sympathy or attention out of it. Unlike Modi who still gets attention and sympathy out of having been a tea maker in the past. It's not surprising to me that he did this kind act. I'm gonna be the 'that guy' here.

Nobody would say such a thing about modi, not even his mother. Says about the character of a man....i have always believed him to be a nice person and preferred him over the two goons we got....my friends say that he is stupid but i reply that ""i would rather take a stupid man over murderous lunatics not that he is stupid"" Bhakt nahi maanenge Good people aren't really cut out for politics...agar modi ji hotay to roz ek tweet kartay family kay saath What's wrong with this dude?like I don't see a flaw on this guy Empathy isn't dead Cant believe the people of India chose a rioter,chaiwala,unsecular leader instead of this guy Check out the articles comment section! Politics need to change from when politicians say who is the worst party, don't vote for them to look at the improvements we have done and vote for us. And frankly at some places i I can see it changing. There is progress. It's slow but it's there. Read comments under the news source. Rahul, you are a good man. Thank you. Dayum BJP wasted their 4 fully qualified future election candidates and he thanks Rahul. I usually don't participate in political slugfests (!) but I wonder what his constituents have to say about that?

Especially victim's families who have had no communication with their decades-old MP! 

Again, nothing to take away from the ""humanitarian"" aspect of it, if at all it can be called that! *everyone liked that.* I'm not pro congress, that's what I think at least. but since so many of you say he's nice but not a good politician. why? what doesn't make him a good politician?  his inability to argue? are his plans bad? I'm just asking out of curiosity :) His character was assassinated by BJP. I was their strategy to gain popularity. Just like they did with Nehru, calling such a great man a “womaniser” and what not. Everyone saying he is not a good politician haven't seen RG transform from his younger days in politics when he used to make blunders in speaking. His 2014 campaign was absolute trash and this is the image of RG that most here have held on to. 

In the run up to 2019-LokSabha, RG went on a world tour, met and talked with people around the world, and established himself worldwide to an extent as India's potential PM. He also helped INC win 5 states (I know what happened in KA and what's happening in MP, but hey atleast they won then.) , 4 of them in the BJP's hindi heartland. 

Then he went around many universities and had open question-answer sessions with students where he brilliantly and confidently answered all of their questions. On the congress youtube channel, they had two episodes of 'Apni Baath Rahul Ke Saath' in which RG talked to youth in one episode and some people of the working class in another.

Come the Lok Sabha campaign. INC releases their manifesto which listed their promises in a great way and RG promised to carry out all of these. RG started campaigning in the south where his rallies were longer due to the translation required. Then he went on north where in every rally he would have approximately 20 minute speeches mainly speaking about unemployment, demonitization, and his NYAY. (Here is where he could have done it a little more aggressively as the fiercest statement would be Chowkidaar chor hai, never more than that.)

And lets not forget, he had several interviews with various tv channels, and he occasionally vlogged on his youtube channel. He also held regular press conferences. On the other hand, Narendra didn't have a single unscripted interview whilst also refraining from saying even a word in his press conference.

TL;DR: RG used to be an inept politician but he improved a lot in the run up to the 2019 election. He could have potentially been a competent PM. I think he reverse psychologyied them to not praise him so that they'll Here for the salt 🧂 😂 simp Excellent! Kudos to him Awesome!! Nice Incoming bhakt arguement

*arey bro tujhe pata nahi hai rahul gandhi kitna ganda aadmi hai usne ek ladki ka rape kiya tha apne dosto ke saath phir us ladki ka kabhi pata nahi chala* Guilt perhaps? I remember watching the December protests (after the rape) and noticing no one from Congress / UPA was responding to the outrage. In fact the protestors at Rashtrapati bhavan were dispersed using water cannons. Clearly the government understood mood of the nation and promptly shifted her to Singapore, knowing her death here would worsen the situation. 
Secondly, he was in a position of authority to bring in a legislation to treat minors as adult in heinous crimes. From all news reports it was clear that the juvenile was the most cruel and remorseless criminal, who actually pulled out her intestines... and due to legalities, he walked away without any penal consequences. Be a good man, but don't go around trying to prove it. Among all of this chaos, its nice to see that some mortality prevails even in the most challenging situation. This action, will speak louder than words—unless BJP comes with a mind-boggling narrative. If the Gandhi family leaves congress forever, I may one day vote for it.
But currently, Congress doesn't deserve to exist. how it came out now then? no more a secret??? just curious.. This seems quite suspicious. Why they all of a sudden decided to reveal it? I can understand the sentiment to keep it a secret but it's hard to believe a news story like this. Especially with all the false news spreading these days. Find it hard to trust any of these politicians. [removed] And you believe it ? Corrupt politician pays money to gain sympathy from voters . Never heard of this before.

This happened under congress rule. One of the accused committed suicide under congress establishment. There were delays in providing medical support to nirbhaya , that is also a failure of the government. 

Gangsters like Dawood, and terrorist like Hafiz also do a lot for their communities, are they nice people too? Pappu Ans his family have systematically looted the country and everybody knows that. He way more neech human being than nice guy. Papu Aaj Pass Hogaya ;) ! Then why is he saying it out and getting published in online articles. Sorry can't believe it wasn't intentional.

Politics,"Sena hails Arvind Kejriwal, says Delhi CM singlehandedly taking on BJP’s Hindu-Muslim politics",417,f0773x,https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/delhi-assembly-polls-2020/story/sena-arvind-kejriwal-delhi-cm-taking-bjp-politics-election-1644109-2020-02-07,46,,Budget-Independent," Look at frightened BJP. They have landed entire BJP Army for Delhi Elections - Modi, Shah, Goyal, Yogi, Jawdekar etc. against small party. Politics badalne aaye hain hum... Arvind Kejriwal.

Edit: ( We are here to change political discourse.. Arvind Kejriwal)

Guys he was not kidding. If your rivals respect you, you are doing great Shiv Sena? It's like Himmler praising the Brits for kicking Hitler's ass. What's happening? And for that reason only , hope Kejriwal Wins .. hope Delhities don't vote for those who try to divide us Indian's .. Don't forget that shiv sena stopped the mumbai arey shed tree cutting. 
   And paused the bullet train project because who the fuck would want to go to ahmedabad. It should have never been Mumbai -ahmedabad but
Mumbai-delhi these are most important routes.
  And because of modi not much ships dock at mumbai he moved them to gujrat motherfucker stelling our money by moving trade to his state.
     Many people complain of sena being a gunda sarkar how it has ties to don type people of mumbai. But then this has been past. But then it is far better then supporting bjp.
  Now the ruling gov is a 3 party of sena ,ncp and congress. This is far better then bjp whose CM used to say ME PUNHA YEIL ME PUNHA YEIL ( i will come back again) thank god he isnt cm now.
Because of bjp maharashtra is in its  highest debt in its entire history.

     Most of maharashtra people are in support of AAP wish even we get this much facilities and had a CM like him. lol yeah no still fuck you shiv sena >**Hindu-Muslim politics**

Before making new allies ShivSena used to be headmaster of school of Hindu-Muslim politics and BJP master in Maharashtra. Now headmaster has gone on leave and will return on duty after some time but at this time the whole school is in the hand of BJP.

ShivSena is in quagmire. It had to quit this kind of politics in pressure (of allies). I think this is not good for ShivSena. It's Hindutva votes would transfer to the BJP and BJP would become more powerful in Maharashtra.

EDIT: Biggest gainer in this game is NCP and then BJP and even after winning CM seat I would see ShivSena as a loser because they have lost ideology on which their party was based on. Looks who is talking.",2020-02-07 15:32:46
Politics,What ia preventing you from joining politics?,59,f0513f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f0513f/what_ia_preventing_you_from_joining_politics/,123,"Say you are disappointed with the state of affairs. You think the economy, the politics, the state, can be better managed and you have thoughts, theories and ideas on how.

So wise men and women of India, what's preventing you from taking matters into your own hands? 

Why do you allow yourself to be governed poorly (say)? Or, are you satisfied?",kammra," One, I don't want to go to jail. 

Two, a good proportion of dumb people means that my politics have to be dumb too, and something that will appeal to dumb minds. My dumb logic has to be right. This is very difficult, and only truly dumb politicians or truly smart politicians can pull this off. The acting level required is just too much.

Politics is too much of a commitment in a developing country. Real smart, committed idealistic people were once in politics. Most of us better educated, more intelligent people **today** are too practical to waste our lives in something where we are likely to fail. In our area there are a lot of educated middle class people who stood for elections, both local and national level. No one voted for them. These were people who are visible in local drives like trash cleaning, vaccination drives and other sundry matters. But no one votes for them. It is either BJP or Congress or some other established party. So its no use unless you have a lot of money to blow in deposit. I am not ready to sell my morality to the highest bidder yet. The IAS is an infinitely better option if you want the country to change. They are the ones who implement the policy in the first place rather than the politicians who are just there to sign. If anyone's name is Arnab please don't answer this question.

(Check out OPs username)

Edit: /s What is preventing you from joining politics? 
As for me, I'm just part of the pipeline that everyone goes through. A sheep, not a leader. I follow or remain ignorant. It's true that I am sorely disappointed by the state of affairs and want things to change. But that doesn't mean I would want to join politics. I can rather become an occasional activist and focus on my original passion. Joining politics needs a lot of commitment and thus time, which would just lead me to stray from my actual passion. So yeah, occasional activism works better for me. I am an introvert. I can't go around campaigning. Nor do I have funds it needs even give a decent fight. And I can't go around begging for funds too. But if I do get elected, say through RS, I would be willing to join politics and do the job. I think it's not a level field with all the goons currently present. Unless you have backing of some political group (which defeats the purpose), it is nearly impossible for a middle class guy to risk my life including the life of my family. While I know risks and can understand we need people who can work for common people and poor, it won't go unnoticed by the corrupt that I will be exposing a lot of their shit on the way. My political opinions are illegal. A few crores. The people of this country elected Modi twice. I can understand wanting to show congress that its hold on the nation is done for. But electing someone - who doesn't even have a degree, can't hold his own in unscripted interviews, believes in ancient Hendu Stronk bullshit etc - a *second time,* makes me not want to do *anything* for this country. [removed] I was a member and still support a small party called Loksatta. They contested MLA elections in 2013 and Bengaluru municipal elections in 2015. Our candidates always came third or lower (behind BJP and Congress). It was disheartening. We put in money from our own pockets. Campaigned on the issues that matter. And yet, I saw first hand, how the so-called educated voters still view elections with a communal mind (religion and caste). I saw BJP and Congress workers openly bribing families in slums. That's when I realized it's hard. Delhi and AAp's victory was an exception, not the norm. India will remain a third world country because much of its people vote based on all the wrong priorities. The day voters hold leaders accountable for real important matters will be the day parties like AAP or Loksatta gain nationwide acceptance. But sadly I do not see that happening anytime soon. 1. Most elections are determined by campaign expenditure 
2. People don't have the time, knowledge, awareness or critical thinking to assess their options 
3. Politics has always been dirty and there is a very real chance of losing life and limb if you flip off the local mafia which is often also the local politician's family

&#x200B;

You can still donate to the candidate you favour, if not in money you can volunteer, join their campaign and use your skills to help them win. Also, I am useless. I am honest and cannot dupe people. I like being alive I am some one who believe that an Individual has to think about his own development and making himself strong financially,mentally etc while not at all obstructing the development of fellow individuals . All these individuals make up the country and inturn mean that country will develop along with them . It is such a development where we no longer need any leader . Thus i stay away from politics . I know it sound unreal and cringy, but that is what i think . Have you joined politics?
If not, what prevents you from joining? Iam not a yes person, politics requires yes people I need a godfather to enter in politics Just because one is disappointed with something, it doesn't warrant participation. If you aren't happy with a meal, you don't try to become the chef. You can complain and try to set things right or you just go where you find better food. There are millions who are sick of this country, not all of them are going to join politics. And just joining politics will in no way give matters into your own hands. I'm not 'allowing' myself to be governed poorly because I exercised my right and voted for whom I believed in, the problem is that person/party didn't win which is beyond my control. But is it really feasible for a graduate to take politics as a career? Don't have public speaking skills [deleted] >So wise men and women of India, what's preventing you from taking matters into your own hands? 

Can you tell me (or point to some document) the path I should follow if I want to do this? Assuming that I am a nobody in politics or social/public work. I want a team of well determined persons...people whom I can trust...those who can go without bread for a day if needed...guess it's only me..plus I have no money...without money you cannot do anything substantial...if you go to the root of problems...maybe your brain will pop out of your head...if not you have underestimated the problem itself ....because individual capacities are only marginally different compared to the problems we are facing...  
People like Gandhiji can bring a change but they come once in many years...until large number of individuals are committed to become gandhi themselves (given only few succeed)...there is no hope even if you join politics...playing a moral game is a titanic task Joining politics, aahh, I used to think about this. But when I saw the ground reality i.e. the issues of each constituency differ on the basis of caste/religion and class issues + the very fundamental issues of roti kapda makaan which have existed right from independence. 

Most of our citizenry hasn't been provided with the bare basics i.e. Food security, employment opportunities, law and order, and education.

Most of us fight to fulfill all these needs.
Inme se, jo bhi populist politicians provide/promise karte hain, vote unhi ko milta hai. (basically violating election spending norms all the time, everywhere)

Fir votes milte hain religion and caste based - state sanctioned benefits k basis pe.  
So one needs resources, popularity, and good presence (on stage and in the news)

Plus if one talks sense like how farm loan waivers are bad for the economy (empirically proven), then they'll be shown the door by the voters as they fall for the narrative created by opportunist politicians.

Also, very few voters can visualize the long term effects of any policy pursued by a government. Jab tak uske positive effects dikhte hain, another government gets the credit for it and vice versa. Public memory is actually very short lived. 

So unless we improve the standard of education and thereby critical thinking, I believe, we, as a populace, deserve the politicians we get. After all, politicians are a mirror for our society.



So I'll rather watch the fall of Rome from the comfort of my home,on WiFi. :P Itna Ameer nahi hai Mera baap Come from middle class family, don't have much backup. Need to work to build backup Money, personality, and mainly money. My bad habit of telling the truth !",2020-02-07 12:10:35

Since they know, with their lobbying power, and virtual oligopolies in such markets where they have a stronghold, it would be very difficult to reverse such benefits

Little wonder the Govt is opening up to hot money like ODI via FPI (and prolly even p notes will enter the scene soon), gives billions in tax cuts to chutiyas who in turn feed the electoral bonds but is woefully nonchalant about the unemployed and the farmers. Modi is even stealing money from LIC and Bhakt have no problem with it. Raghuram Rajan was an honest man who refused to bow down to Modi's demand to extract money from RBI. In Modi's New India, if you don't dance to the tune of BJP you will be thrown out of any post you hold. Sensex is high, our economy is working just fine........Oh wait. The only positive which is working in this govts favor is lower crude prices.  If it hits $100 a barrel for a couple of quarters, these jokers will be clueless on what to do.

I've been saying this since 1999. Heck even Bollywood made movies on this same issue over and over again. We respected Army to the core but also kept them on pedestal for these crimes as well. We never were blind supporters of anybody. That's why we were free to question every institution without fear. Today people say ""you are crazy to question Army"" and institutions? Well very convenient, who gave you that message, the perpetrators and it's supporters I guess. Well a Rapist never likes to be called out for the crimes he did, why would he support the idea of questions?

Rest of the points, you described India in general since 2014. And these same people had problems when petrol prices were 5 rupees high. Now they don't question even when it is +50 rupees high. Vegetables and rest other commodities +100 high. Because their brain has been washed. The media, the it cell, the zero pressure govt and it's institution, the fear mongering, has made people fearful and weak. 

Don't even for a minute ever think that this attempt to shoot was to create fear among Shaheen Bagh protestors. No, they are fearless and are not afraid to die even though they are dying slowly by protesting.

 This Shooting, Kunal's Ban, Azad's arrest, Rohith's suicide, Kanhaiya's false allegation not amounting to police chargesheet, Kalburghi+Pansare+Dabholkar+Gauri Lankesh Murders, Akhlakh+Pehlu Khan's Murders, Child Asifa's Rape in Temple, Judge Loya's not so mysterious Death, Bhima Koregaon investigation pulled off, etc etc...everything has been done to show the people of India, DON'T REPEAT WHAT THEY DID OR YOU'LL FACE THE SAME FATE. My dad is an air force vet, and he himself questions the morality of soldiers who indulge in such heinous activities and soil the army's name. However, he never blames the army, he targets that specific group of soldiers who have done this.

We pay our taxes, if government misuses it then it's not fault. We are civilians. That doesn't mean I support human rights violations, but it is wrong to attack civilians. So what do I do if I don't believe what you believe in? Because you didn't say why you believe what you believe.

I get that the comedian is mocking him with his own words, but when someone is traveling and is on a flight, should their personal space not be respected? 
I hardly find this funny because it seems to me like a cheap jab at someone who does not wish to comment at a particular time when anything he could have said could be taken in a wrong light.
Personally, I am of the opinion that this anchor rarely speaks of relevant news and if he does it's hard for him to continuously say relevant information for a while and it's actually better that he's silent. I don't think I can take Kamra seriously any more, especially after [this](https://twitter.com/vivekagnihotri/status/1222371368920068096?s=19) expose of him. It really shows he has built an image by being anti-modi and is not in pursuit of a true political analysis but simply uses the ""Modi Bad"" jokes to build a core fan base.

“You’d sell suicide of a student to beat Modi? I asked.

Such is the situation.. Pax : “bhaiya, this left!”

Driver : “aao chalenge police station, anti-national!” You missed the turn!

_I know_ [removed] it is kind of amazing that driver has not been blocked on the platform. suspension was for a few days right while 'they investigated'?

there was no crime. it was not a citizen arrest. it was plain kidnapping. Fascism has always been attractive to the lowest common denominator in the population.

Politics,"Today, Congress has been greatly weakened or become politically irrelevant in 143 Lok sabha due to breakaway regional Congress parties led by former regional leaders",50,fge15y,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fge15y/today_congress_has_been_greatly_weakened_or/,12,"* West Bengal : 42 seats, breakaway party = All India Trinamool Congress

* United Andhra pradesh : 42 seats, breakaway party = YSR Congress

* maharashtra : 48 seats, breakaway party = National Congress party

* Chattisgarh : 11 seats, breakaway party = janta Congress Chattisgarh

In all these 143 seats, Congress was earlier a strong player. In fact, a strong performance in Andra pradesh in 2004 by Congress was the reason vajpayee lost power in 2004.

Congress needs to become more democratic where aspirations of regional leaders are allowed to flourish.

Not mentioned here, Himanta Biswa Sarma who left Congress in frustration due to lack of decision making and joined bjp. He is the primary reason behind BJP's rise to power in North East . Congress handling of him was a massive self goal

And why should we care?

Congress is responsible for its own downfall and we don't owe them anything. 

As far as defeating BJP is concerned, congress is the biggest roadblock. Whenever congress is the biggest opposition in a state, BJP ends up winning easy or forms govt afterwards anyways. Mamata is holding her fort in WB, Kejriwal maintained his status in Delhi and Sharad Pawar halted BJP in Maharashtra. The country will be much better without the carcass of congress. Congress has tried to decimate local leadership since Rajiv Gandhi time . Remember when He humiliated sitting Andra CM in an Airport which led to congress losing to NT Rama Rao in 1982.

And since then this has always been a time honoured tradition of Gandhi family clear out any regional leader who may challenge their in future. 

They never showed any respect any regional leaders and only ones mattered were if you in their inner circle.Afterall this is their property so who can complain. Congress have themselves to blame. In regards to the Telugu states; few policy decisions were being made at the central level and many politicians used the word ‘high command’. The word high command even permeated into pop culture where it was parodied and used in movies, and people used to joke about it. 

After YSR’s death, the word high command became commonplace. It was embarrassing. People hated being controlled by a person sitting 1500kms away. They became spineless. All that Congress wants at the moment is for things go to so so bad that people just end up voting for Congress and Rahul Gandhi can be the PM. 

Their insistence on not having a non-Gandhi PM candidate is crushing. They are proving everyone right in calling them a dynastic political party. Congress doesn't have anyone but itself to blame.

They actively refrained from campaigning in West Bengal and Odisha in 2019, and allied with wrong parties. For all practical purposes Congress is a relic of the past. 

Muslims used to vote for Congress. Now they have nowhere to go. They must organize their own Hindostan Party which would include every one except the Hindutva adherents. And they must do it fast.",2020-03-10 21:45:18

Jai Hind! > The arrest of a Muslim dairy farmer in West Bengal’s Hooghly district for selling cow urine and dung as an antidote to COVID-19 has sparked a political row, with the State BJP president Dilip Ghosh questioning the police’s justification in apprehending the man.
Police on Tuesday arrested Mamud Ali, alias Sheikh Mamud, in Hooghly district’s Dankuni, about 25 km from Kolkata, for attempting to “outrage religious feelings” and booked him under Sections 295A and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Well,  the  guy  definitely  deserves  arrest,  like  anyone  selling  quack  cures  at  a  time  of  pandemic. But  what  part  of  it  outrages  religious  feelings?

Politics,Why the Supreme Court’s verdict on SC/ST quotas has created a political storm | It has upheld the state’s powers to deny reservations to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities.,109,f1o839,https://scroll.in/article/952687/why-the-supreme-courts-verdict-on-sc-st-quotas-has-created-a-political-storm,47,,rahulthewall," Muslims and reservation are two distractions used by Indian elites to confuse people. These two are blamed for all of India's problems and people are stupid enough to believe it. 




Honestly, as a dalit I sometimes wish let them remove reservation. Then let them explain to masses how 1% Indians are getting 73% Indian wealth. Within decade there will be riots in streets and true people responsible for Indian poverty will be found out. Sizable dalit tribal population doesn't understand how system is rigged against them, they think reservation is making some difference. These guys can finally wake up. You have 22.5% reservation for 29% SC,ST in government jobs which are just 4% of total jobs. And people think this is useful or something. The main question we need to ask is where are the damn jobs ? I have said previously that Scheduled Castes and Tribes are next on the list after Muslims.

Looks like I was wrong. They're targeting everyone at the same time, just with a different approach. >The other problem is also the court’s selective affirmation of the state’s discretionary powers for providing reservations. When it comes to a decision not to provide reservations, the court feels the state has absolute discretion and need not collect data to justify this decision. But when the state wants to provide quotas, the court brings in the concept of equality and places several restrictions that dilute the discretionary power of the state. The 50% ceiling for quotas is an example of this restriction.


This alone is enough to show how the SUPREME COURT is disingenuous and biased as hell and their end goal isn't equality of any sorts. First they stopped making it compulsory for promotion in government jobs and now will give only lower level jobs to reservations.
Second they stopped compulsory arrest in SC/St act and will give pree arrest anticipatory bail to the accused.

This is the destruction of the act itself. 

Bc reservation is not the government spooge to give its a bloody constitutional right. Get that modi shah I wish the govt does try fucking around with the reservations. I truly pray that they somehow think that by making their stooges pass such judgements that they can alter the basic tenets of reservations and try curtailing it. It will be the end of this govt. Period. Come on BJP/RSS! Try messing with reservations. Please. You can do it!! Show us how tough you are. First Moslems , now SC/ST ; good job BJP judiciary /govt . Golly what is with this government? Talk to upper caste, and they believe BJP is shit and giving SC/ST everything. Talk to SC/ST, they say its upper caste party

Who the fuck voted for these mfs? I believe reservations  should be based on economic conditions and not on caste.
The reason is many sc's and st's have a high family income yet take advantage of reservation.
On the other hand there are many general candidates that have very low family income yet have no such advantage.

Reservations(if any) should be used to lift the distressed classes and not lift the already uplifted.",2020-02-10 18:00:46

As it turns out, there is United Nations genocide convention that defines the term, and what happened to the Sikhs, while likely a crime against humanity, does not meet that definition, says Frank Chalk, a Concordia University history professor and past president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars.
While the  victims were clearly targeted because of their religion, the killings were not part of a “long-term, sustained and systematic” effort, perpetrated by government, to wipe out the Sikhs, which is how genocide is described in the UN convention, he said.

Politics,Losing friends over politics.,117,emb3gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/emb3gi/losing_friends_over_politics/,67,"I've been critical about Modi from the start and a lot of my friends have been bjp supporters. I'm talking about 2014 LS elections. I used to share memes and all online, they saw it but the difference of opinion never affected our friendship. But last month since Jamia incident, it reached my saturation point and I'm just posting against the govt and all without any self censorship or considering about their feelings, posting photos and videos from protests I'm participating in and they've started losing their shit. I've lost so many friendships since then. I didn't care and have no regrets until recently, a really good friend of mine,a school friend, uploads demonstration he's participated in support of CAA. I would've blocked if it were any other person but I gave him benifit of doubt. Talked to him. We were having a productive discussion until the point he started justifying the actions taken by UP police and Delhi Police. UP police raiding homes was ""teaching them a lesson"" and ""maintain law and order"". I got so rattled with such a response. He never was like this. We have such wonderful school memories together. He's never been this venomous. I'm in a dilemma and don't know what to do next.",kingslayerz33," I have. I've ditched almost all my friends from school-time. To be honest, current political issues are much more than regular 'politics'. In this political climate, some people are showing disturbing shades of personalities. It is much more than just a difference in political opinions. It is about humanity. If a person shows something negative in this regard, try to fix it. If cannot be done...sayonara. [deleted] Circumstances like these are when people show their true colors. Use this as an opportunity to weed out shitty people from your life. Good riddance. Aisa kachra life mein na ho to behtar hai. Deleted a close friend from my friend list because of the constant propaganda he was sharing on my timeline. So much hatred for Muslims even though he himself was in a relationship with a Muslim girl I lost 3 friends, one being my throughout school friend. I think I still have no regrets standing for what’s correct :) This is the biggest crime that Modi & Shah are guilty of: destroying the social fabric of the country through the use of classic propaganda and brainwashing techniques, but using social media. No other politician has achieved this on such a scale.

The only people who escaped the spell of these two rogues are a small minority who are naturally sceptical about everything. Looks like your friend didn't escape the spell.

It is no coincidence that the growing opposition to ShahModi now is coming from young people, who have a better understanding of how media manipulation works and who possess a natural scepticism about things that their parents' generation blindly believes in. I haven't lost friends but I'm seriously reconsidering breaking up some friendships. A lot of people aren't really having a lot in their lives to talk about and it's easy to talk about politics. 
I have always been a centrist in my political views and it seems as few want me to join their ""team"". It's a dirty game, but you don't have to play it. I can be your friend OP :) Sad, but I went through this just the other day. I knew he was a bhakt, but not such a violent one with such low regard for human life. Long story short, it wasn't even a discussion, he outright started abusing me because I shared a post on my feed about keeping personal information safe, etc. Minutes later, a friendship of 13 odd years just disappeared. It's better to cut these kinds of people out, the sooner the better. They: don't lose friendship over politics, yaar


Me: Can't lose friendship over humanity, yaar. Goodbye. Why do you want to be friends with such a bigot? Welcome to my world buddy. You are in the same boat as I. My best friend has turned into a soft bhakt and justifies every action of the govt one way or the other. He is one of the kindest man I know and about 80% of his friends are Muslims and yet the cognitive dissonance persists. The only difference between our situations is we do not post memes and articles in our common group. We both know where the other stands politically and I call out on his bullshit if he open his mouth regarding the CAA or NRC debacle but we keep it respectful.

We don't name call each other. We have a mature conversation and usually never come to an agreement. The only thing I ever said that was harsh was that hope he doesn't stand on the pavement while his muslim friends are being hauled into an uncertainty and shouting that they should get into the vans because the govt said so. He kept quiet and never spoke about the CAA issue with me ever again. We meet now and talk about life in general. Keep politics minimal. There is a tacit understanding that we value the friendship more than our political differences. I remember a quote from a game which aptly describes your dilemma , it goes like this '' Friends, who want to remain friends, don't discuss religion or politics''.

But, we need to draw a line somewhere, if your friend starts justifying premeditated  violence on innocent citizens, then it's time to start evaluating your friendship. Kanhaiya Kumar actually raised this point in his recent speech at JNU. Modi is dividing families and friends. *First they ignore you, then they laugh at you,* ***then they fight you***, *then you win* Distance yourself from these venomous snakes. Indian people don't know about the term ""opinion"". They are stupid and have a mentality of if your opinion is not same as mine, fuck you! I was just saying today how this moment in time has brought out the true colours of so many people we know. On one hand it's shocking to see the hate and utter stupidity but on the other it's heartening to see the good. 

You need to decide whether you're okay being friends with these people. They aren't just people who have a difference in political opinions. They're straight up hate-mongering, blood-thirsty, bigoted pieces of filth. Recently I have lost my good friend too. He doesn't used to be like that, but he is acting differently. He started saying that most of the muslim doesn't know what actually CAA and started the crap. Then he said after explaining these thing to muslim dominated  community in bangalore everyone changed their mind and they are in support of CAA. A convenient story to dismiss ones view, I am sure he is using the WhatsApp forward messages. Then I argued with him that CAA itself is unconstitutional as you are discriminating on the basis of religion. Then he started saying this is very emotional matter to him, started crying about Hindus in other country. I said u could take the persecuted in your country regardless of religion or country. Then he said we cant take everyone as we have enough population so discarding few of them. I had enough explaining him about this but he is not listening and asking me to change my mind. If this is the case then they weren't WORTHY friends to begin with

I assume liberal Germans lost a lot of friends to Nazi politics

U know they stayed silent and what happened then?

SS killed all Liberal activists. U r speaking up and not submitting to authority that's why Modi is silent else he wud have impose 144 everywhere. Jab tum mehgayi berozgari or Mandi ki baat karoge to main tumhe Hindu muslim me uljha dunga

ache din aagaye Mitrooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnn >they saw it but the difference of opinion never affected our friendship.

that's because you're a privileged ""moderate"" who prefers negative peace to positive justice. politics always affects people you were just privileged enough to not care. See if he your true and old  friend, then you should not care about his political views at all, like seriosuly just don't discuss politics with everyone or scrutinize everyone's social media post. It is not worth it family and friends are made not of similarity of political views but on relations and experiences. .


Please don't consider doing a weeding out or something like that of friends over political views or stuff, it would just leave you friendless in an echo chamber of ""new friends"" with only common thing being politics. There is much more to life than modi or politics, just discuss that...there is like a 1000 issues to discuss which you guys might see exactly same, why fight over one thing you guys differ ????? People who support murderers and criminals are accomplices

I don't want to be friends with criminal accomplices Welcome to the boat! I am also trying to reason out with friends as much as I can. 

One question I got asked is ""Look at the situation of West Bengal, these immigrants are creating violence and chant anti national slogans. Why should we tolerate them?""  


I am not too aware of the realities in West Bengal though. Is it that only immigrant Muslims cause trouble there? Can someone please enlighten me about the above point. I feel like Social Media has a huge part in this. 10 years ago, no one would talk about politics in person with the kind of intensity we use on social media. How old are you? 


I had to cut off ties and leave my the WhatsApp groups for the same reason during the first week of strikes. It was appalling to see people who I have known for years to defend the violence/BJP. 

I’m at an age where I don’t want myself to be surrounded by enablers. Everything was “changa si” with labels and stuff but if one comes around and defends/justifies the kind of violence which happened on 15/12 and 05/01, then piss off, mate. This happens when we grow balls to talk about something we are invested or excited in. But honestly, given your description, it's just a difference of opinions. Maybe go to their place, spend time with them, but don't bring up this topic. Remember JNU came now, these are your old friends. Are you really open for discussion? No, because when you post something ""without censorship"" others should be OK but when someone else has contrary view to you start with a judgement (you mention you gave him benefit of doubt) that they are somehow wrong or misguided and you are not. Then you mention you talk to them (rather convince them to switch sides) and when they too present their uncensored opinion, you get rattled.

Bigots atleast are self-empowered in their expression of hateful ideologies and most start by wanting to fit in with their families.

If those who disagree dont grow some spine to oppose loved ones,youre not really going to make a dent in those you dont love. Youll just do what youve been taught to do by family members,at best. Run away.",BoozeCroc," We need to teach critical thinking and formulating proper arguments. And then begin asking questions to teachers and parents, who mostly don't like their authority to be questioned. Things follow from there. lol, gave me a chuckle. My uber-serious Indian girlfriend broke up with me because she couldn’t stand up to her Dad’s emotional brainwashing.
We were almost engaged 😅 Indian family structure is oppressive inherently. Schools, media, family, everything is geared at teaching a concept of respect that makes it difficult for Indians to counteract against families. Those who do are rubbished throughout the extended families as black sheep.

What needs to happen is a change in our system of education as well as the current generation being better parents to their children, enabling them an opportunity to be critical thinkers. Exactly! Though I believe that this had it's roots in our culture as well as the education system. From childhood itself, the idea of unquestioned adherence to our parents and teachers is instilled quite deeply, and the same people lose the ability to question any kind of authority and grow up to become obedient peons of the society. They have no idea that what is taught to them is not always the right thing, and that there's always a different perspective to look at things. As long as this doesn't change, no amount protests is going to make a difference. Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully teachers in school.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully managers in work places.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully relatives in their families.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully bigoted unkills spreading vitriol in whatsapp groups.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to the truth and accept it, and not be crying like a whining b*tch.

Also, Indians need to learn to call a piece of shit a piece of shit, a scumbag a scumbag, an arsonist an arsonist, a rapist a rapist and so on. I could not agree with you more. This is primarily one of the reasons why Indians are so docile and meek when it comes to defending their own ideas. It is primarily because since childhood, they are covered under the shroud of ""culture"" and ""riwaz"" and adults are these infallible and unerring beings who you should always listen to and never ever question their authority, even in a polite and civil fashion.  Not to mention that if you do veer off against the ideology of your parents, sometimes the consequences can be dire as you can be abused physically, mentally or be outright abandoned. 

This is the reason why we hesitate so much to speak out against corrupt politicians, abusive policemen or local netas; it is because the idea of blind respect is forcefully drilled into our brains from a very young age. Unlike western countries, we don't have child protection agencies who look out for the welfare of kids and parents can pretty much get away with anything they do to their children in the name of ""discipline"".

I wholeheartedly believe that if Indian parents did a proper job of raising kids, we'd have a better society overall which would question people in leadership, would be more confident and assertive, and would possess the ability to comprehend what is right and wrong on a larger level.  Unfortunately when you raise kids in the environment of fear, jealousy and hate, you have the contemporary India that we can all see. Dont give up guys. I have changed my parents outlook to somewhat extent. Hope you will also after trying. Indians do need to stand up to their parents whenever it is necessary, especially for life changing situations such as further education, marriage, life and so on. 
But, the problem is Indian kids are so fearful, that they hide even their basic relations with boyfriends/girlfriends for fear of being disowned. Indian kids depend on money from parents, at times upto even 25 years or even 30 years. Parents use these tools to control kids in their later life. 

Heck, in my family, my own sister who's a ""strong independent woman"" can't convince her boyfriend to elope because that dude is a complete mama's boy which makes me want to tell my sister to leave him because he's such a coward. The dude has a Master's degree and yet has never even heard of the Special Marriages Act. That's the society today, literate yet illiterate; educated yet fools; brazen yet cowards. My mother uses kundalis and religious teachings generously to keep us controlled, usually backfiring tremendously at the expense of the entire family. Almost always there is an unhealthy dose of arguments.

Why are there more than 2 lakh engineering students unemployed in India today? Why is there a lack of lawyers in India? Why is there a lack of legit thinkers in India? Why is dissent being shunned? All because elders are ""always right, and anyone below the age of 40 is a child, and children know nothing""! 

I believe in being rebellious all the time... This is to get answers to questions no one is ready to answer. Have a good day! :) A friend of mine told me how he stood up to his bigoted af uncle. When he started on his usual hate-filled rant about how Muslims are ruining this country, my friend started recording. The point was simple - if he has the conviction, and feel what he is saying is the truth, then he shouldn't be scared to air his views. Needless to say, he couldn't.


Edit : A word Ran away from my shit-hole of a home last year and moved to a brand new city thousands of kilometers down south. And I've never been back. Fuck Indian Parents and the toxic society that acts as an enabler to them.

Also, /r/AntiNatalism. We follow a feudal structure in India, along with strong patriarchy.

Even Hinduism is feudal in nature with its caste system.

Everything needs to broken to be remade.

*Sigh*
If only it were possible in our lifetime. Yeah when you don't rebel a bit, they never change. And a lot of people think they'll be disowned for the smallest of arguments. Remember they need you more than you need them after a few years.

I showed mine graphic videos of lynching and they finally disapproved what was happening. Agreed. Indian parents want the youth to emulate Bhagat Singh, only not their own spawn. saar, mummy khaana nahi pakayegi toh mar jaungaa Yesterday I had a heated argument with my dad, conservative, over the CAB and its protests. I can't believe an Engineer like him can be so illogical and blind to balance. Like, you're either supporting CAB because of emotional, irrational bias to BJP (Which is wtf, has the party sucked your cock off or what. Why the blind faith? Bhagwan thodi hai?) Or because of apathetic majoritarian mindset.

Either make me embarassed and disgusted at my father. Called him stupid and emotional for supporting the bill. F*ck this so called culture/traditions. Be free! be independent! But first move out of your parent's basement! the phrase ""mai baap sarkaar"" exists for a reason. Instead of the government serving the people, the default assumption in India seems to be that the government is doing you a favor  by ruling and telling you what to do (witness demonetization, upcoming NRC etc). Bhai this is so true... Yesterday I was out shopping with my mom and the shop had a TV telecasting this... The keeper and my mom started slurring about them, ""aur karo protest"" and smirking. I felt so guilty. I did that today. My father understood. But jokingly called me a communist. I did, multiple times. Got beaten up too, multiple times. What a shot, what a shot! Totally agree. Hahaha truer words have never been spoken... Most of my friends are still shocked by how chill my parents are and always when i give advice of talking to parents for their opinion i often get ridiculed about it. 

Folks are just afraid of their parents even after being 25 plus. Haha

\*cries in cowardice and dependence on them\* Bhai kya bola hai.. tere muh me ghee shakkar. I agree with most of what you say but here is the thing. Its not your parents faults. Simple as that. If we think we are better than them in terms of our 'forward' and 'open minded' thinking then we also need to realize that our parents were born and brought up in a completely different era. We have no idea what they have been through. Those times were rotten with fear and depression.

Take for example my grandparents who lived during the fearful war days around 1940's and almost escaped a burning train during the India Pakistan division. My mom and her family lived in fear and oppression her entire life. She wanted to get herself educated from an English medium school but my grand parents could not afford her education. These were the days. Truly dark times.

Disagree as much as you want with your loved ones. Try to change their thinking but don't force your opinions on anyone for that matter. Try to put yourself in their shoes and just try to understand the world that they have come from

We are moving in a forward direction. The only direction in future is forward. If you don't believe that then you need to open your mind and see where we have come in the last 20 years with the rise of internet and just being able to openly voice our opinions on public forums and social media.

We will change. We will get better. Its going to take time. Probably another 100 years or more but we will get there. Just relax and do your best without hating or offending your loved ones by realizing that they didn't have the same privilege as we do today. They didn't get the opportunities to shine like we have today. So instead of trying to fight them, work with them and try to instill positivity in whatever you do in life. This world is not perfect. No human is perfect and nothing in this world will ever be perfect. Learn to appreciate what you have

Peace and love Maybe it's because I was born in the States, but I leaned in college to just tell me parents what they wanted to hear and then do whatever I wanted anyway. It did not work right away, and led to many fights, but eventually they realized it was my life and I needed to be in control of that. I still solicited them for advice and help, but the final decision is always mine. I don't think it really worked until a decade later when I proved I could make good money without having to be a doctor though. Since then I've advised Indian friends to do the same, but it's had mixed results. I guess it depends on your situation. I agree that it is important to stand up to your family for the things that you believe in. But I don't think any reason why we can't do the both at the same time. Changing people's attitudes is a process and it takes time, especially when you're dealing with your parents. Most of the time they dismiss you as being childish and suffering from the 'idealism of the youth,' and they can do that because they're your parents. 

But I do agree with you, we have to start the process at our home and extend it to wider society. Man, all these stories are making me so grateful for my parents. I'm gonna go now and hug my mom. [deleted] Sorry guys, but misinformed people are a greater threat to this country than any bad politician(Tadipaar and/or Jumlebaaz) Wow that hit right in the sanskar Reminds me of the Russell peters sketch, you have 15 minutes to call the police...tbh your problem is not a problem just in India, it's in other countries If you don't stand for anything you will fall for anything Sometimes standing up to the government is way easier than standing up to parents. It’s natural. Our parents have raised us, and our future is intertwined with them. Very often we are financially dependent on them till we are adults. The level of emotional blackmail possible is very high. Unless we are willing to be cut out of wills and ruin the relationships our children will have with our parents, standing up to parents will always be more difficult than protesting on the street. I would argue the former often needs more courage. Summed up exactlymy feelings..!Change starts from your home. This is so true. I am glad to know many people are thinking about this. hope is kinda lost for this generation's parents, hopefully it would be better from the Millenials onwards. Respect elders and respect teachers mentality needs to go, if I ever have childrens, I will teach them respect only the one's they deem it worthy of it Gold worthy Be financially independent then you can take your own decisions. First young Indians need to smash that bigoted uncle who keeps coming around your house spewing nonsense about poor people and other religious minorities. I’m sure you guys know who I’m talking about. Yaar, I've been standing up to my parents for years now. Pehle it was still better, they did listen. But modia has taken the better of them. It's so much worse now, they speak the modia speak, any evidence, any counter and any argument is fake news to them. It ends up in serious yelling matches no matter how we start it. Earlier there was doubt and suppressed belief that Muslims are bad, now it's a loud and proud truth for them that they want to oppress minorities. Talking politics has become a pain and a constant frustration in the family. My understanding is that Indian boomers lack any empathy, are submissive to the system, fear backlash and have only succumbed to capitalist consumerist materialistic lifestyles. Good luck with that. I gave up trying to reason with my mother. Being the only atheist in a family is difficult. My mother trying to convince me and me trying to convince her. It's a dead end. Not gonna work. I stood up to my parents when I was in my teenage years and they have given me space every since which has made me more confident. 

I was also very anti-establishment when I was younger but it has been clear for some time that both sides are shit including the JNU students, BJP, RSS, Congress and even those protesters in Assam. 

This subreddit is a great example of people not doing much research and going with anything anti-establishment. 

Twitter/Whatsapp is a great example of people not doing any research and going with anything supporting BJP/RSS.

Politics,My fears about how the current political situation would affect the Republic Day celebrations turned out to be true.,233,eu36ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eu36ic/my_fears_about_how_the_current_political/,36,"I've been attending the flag hoisting at our colony's association building for years now. Our colony has always been a lot diverse in terms of religion. Everything was normal after the flag hoisting ceremony, members of the association gave speeches about our constitutional rights, fundamental rights and duties as well as secularism but it soon went downhill from that.

Another man from the colony started his speech about how our constitution and laws need amendments time after time and we should support them, and then he yelled that no matter what we believe we are must respect the national flag and national anthem and those who didn't do that or didn't return the cheer of ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" are of no use to this colony or nation. An odd 4-5 people clapped at his statement after which he proceeded to yell ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" and specifically pointed out this Old Muslim Man who wore a skull cap and came with his grandchildren of about 6-7 years of age that he wasn't cheering the same and he shouldn't stay here. When the old man started to leave, all the 10-12 association members and the president consoled him to stay while he was pulling away, his grandchildren started crying and the 20-25 odd schoolchildren who were there looked perplexed.

The old man decided to stay albeit being a lot sadder and angrier, yelling that he's been here longer than he has and is more patriotic than he ever will be. This incident was followed by the Association President's message that ""No person was supposed to force his beliefs and practices. Everyone has the right to cheer or not cheer for whatever they want"". He proceeded to apologise to the man for the speaker's words and invited him specifically to the function after this. The members of the association then proceeded to apologise and console him. 

Meanwhile, the man who gave the statement was being confronted by a single person for his words and was also being supported by one other man. He shook his hand and praised him for his words.

Ironically, the man who supported his words had stuck his paper flag on his heart turned upside down. 

This incident had me fuming but I calmed down after reminding myself that it was one guy (and the 4-5 odd people who clapped for him) against the 10-12 members and elders of the association who consoled the old man.

[Image from the incident](http://imgur.com/a/a4JA2Qb)

The man in the blue shirt and the red circle was the one who gave the speech, the man in the brown shirt and the blue circle was the man who supported him. The other man in white confronted him and counselled him for his words. I could add a voice record that I recorded out of fear and anticipation that something of this sort would happen.

TL;DR : Muslim man was told to leave the flag hoisting event by a person for not cheering ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" infront of  association members and children from the colony. Association apologizes and condemns his words.",XeroXeroIchi," What a shit-show. Hope the grandchildren remember the other members of the society who stood for their grandfather and not the bokachoda who thought it was appropriate to single out people and display his bigotry. Fucking morons everywhere. Fascist uncles always existed, the only difference now is that they're no longer afraid to speak or even feel obliged to make their racists views known in the name of ""nationalism"". As sad as this sounds, the beautiful thing is that people stood up for the Muslim man. In many cases that would not have happened. The current protests are clear evidence of the pushback and I'm glad it's finally happening. Hopefully it gets better. The muslim answer to such behavior is usually to settle in ""muslim areas"". hindus who can't stand non vegetarian muslims also create their own colonies.

Mist of mumbai is like this. Ghettoism starts this way. Hardly places where multi communities stay.Then theres a lot you'll hear from hindu communities about muslims and vice versa usually bad things and children believe them since they have never lived together with each other.

They'll probably go to different schools and meet each other during college but by that time be so stuck to their ideology that they'll completely ignore each other or be part of a radical group against each others communities.

Each group will have offenses by members of the other group to demean each other I don't know why some people associate chanting ""bharat mata ki jai"" with patriotism. Muslims never refused to sing National Anthem and ""Jai Hind"" and patriotism is not something which we can summed into a single slogan.Muslims do not chant ""bharat mata ki jai "" because it is conflicting with their religion they considered Allah the greatest of all ,that is why a muslim chanting "" bharat mata ki jai"" conflicting the greatness of their Allah.

It is the same way Hindus can not say ""Allahu Akbar(Allah is the Greatest)"" because saying it would be   putting Allah above other Hindus deities.
There are alot of miss understanding in our country regarding Muslims and Madarsas and Islam .Sacchar committee broke those myths but sadly government never took the report seriously.

India Is a Secular country ,and it was Secular before the 42nd amendment in which secular word added in the preamble.

Secularism is one the basic feature of the Constitution and Secularism can not be scrapped unless you scrap the Constitution. You should do a stand up at these things Same. My family decided not to go for this exact reason. Instead we went to family brunch. 

Drama isn't really worth it.

All minority members individually decided to go to separate family events. This brings back memories of my own colony. Good memories. We had people from all over India peacefully living side by side. That's why we can't give up idea of secular India. Rather than chanting bharat mata ki jai people should keep the country clean and become better people. When he originally yelled ""Bharat mata ki Jai"" everyone should have shouted ""Jai Bhim"". Why people organise Republic Day/Independence day , in colonies where illiterates live ? Sad. By the way what is the reason for Muslims to not say Bharat mata ki jai? This is just one of the many examples of how society has sadly been divided on religion. Nobody is saying that there were no issues before, but the way they have multiplied through fake, biased news and WhatsApp is sad.

BJP has enough money to buy MLAs in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh etc., but they want common people to contribute to this PM Cares fund.  


They (Modi Govt. / BJP) have money for running their IT cell, and for supporting massive PR campaigns for Modi, but they don't have money for investing in basic healthcare infrastructure in the country. They want (taxpaying) people to donate to pay for the sins of the govrnment. I would rather help my neighbours and my community than donate to these morons. Let all the Bhakts contribute now.",ErDrProf," For the same reason they build that statue. PUBLICITY. Don't forget new parliament and central vista redevelopment project. To build more statues.

So you can die happily by seeing big statues. Because ""PM Cares"" /s I wonder why government has no money. 
Oh wait..what did Shashikant Das ,the new RBI governor do  1st thing he joined the office.? Oh yeah..empty the RBI Treasury saved for national emergency. The government doesn't care about serving the people, all they care about is staying in power for that they are ready to spend millions on statues Also, this PMcares is a new trust setup outside the ambit of the CAG right? The funds cannot be audited for how they were used I assume? They are essentially setting up a fund without parliamentary oversight if that is true, correct?

Arrgh, I have too many questions and I just cant seem to trust this government.

EDIT #1: It looks like others are asking the same question online. Also, it seems contributions to this fund are only 50% eligible for tax rebate whereas the PM relief fund (the older fund) is 100% tax rebate eligible. This is mysterious. Why the fuck would you want to contribute to the fund when you dont even get 100% tax rebate for what you donated? Also Bhakts are going on a rampage against those asking a valid question on twitter.

more discussion and *bhakt randi rona*: https://twitter.com/sardesairajdeep/status/1244573608015429638

EDIT #2: This is getting mukier. As of now, I hear public sector bank employees are being asked to give up two days of salary **MANDATORILY VOLUNTARILY** for this fund. Someone needs to dig into this to understand how this can be imposed on people mandatorily and that too for a shady trust fund that probably has no oversight. We must not forget that everything and everyone is used only for PR by this regime.once one understands that, other pieces automatically fall into place. Bro you don't understand it's another masterstroke... You know how Nehru is the source of all things evil? Well guess who introduced the PM's Relief Fund??

How the hell do you expect Nehru money to be good?? So our great great prime minister started the PMCARES because he cares about us!! Our great great modiji has been planning all along.... Not just to help covid19 patients but to flush out blek mon

Now watch helplessly in the next campaign when PMCARES fund is shoved down everyones throat as being the savior of the pandemic crisis and you know what the bhakts are gonna fap to it.... Trust me they already are probably thinking ""dusre leaders ne aisa kyu nai kiya ab tak"" People are emotional and govt milking it....btw he promised 15 lakhs in every account lol...and we giving more to him. Better give money to some NGO or to some poor personally. Don't forget bullet train. Around $15billion cost. What an actual turd?

Amount could have been well spent waiving farmers' loans and/or fortifying current rail infrastructure. Thats why I never donated to them. I will help whoever I can directly or through reputed NGOs 'PM-CARES' Oh the Irony. We should also ask that where is the massive amounts of money collected from DeMo, GST etc.? Meanwhile akshay kumar donating the same money donated to him by mudi Buying MLAs...  Thats what i have been rooting for ever since this whole fund was announced , bhakts trending hashtags like (virat kholi donate , akshay kumar donate etc) , i mean these people already pay 100s of crores in taxes , where the hell is that money going ? Why the taxpayers need to pay for their own well being ? That account isn't gov. Account they aren't obligated to show where money is spent. It will be used to buy mla in rajasthan. I get this is an anti BJP post, but I'd be happy if it were a post CRITICISING THE INCUMBENTS. 

We live in a country whose very Constitution has a Directive Principle relating to the development of scientific temper among people and the policymakers. 

But it is sad to see that as time passed, governments gave into divisive politics using the right wing ideology extensively along with hate sentiments. The educated cut themselves off from the democratic exercise and the uneducated started to elect policymakers. Hence, all we get is freebies and people pleasing stunts and nothing else. No structural reforms. And, to our dismay, people who really wished to work for the greater good, were never allowed to do so by their very own people. 

I have no problem with people hating a political party. But, it would've been pleasurable to see educated, technologically forward people critiquing the incumbents and not letting their hate for a said group get the better of them.

I say this holding in regard the very principle of a democratic set up which dictates that there are only legislators in the parliament, and no political parties. Sadly, our very own 'modern' and 'contemprary' leaders have lost sight of this axiom.

And let us not forget the times of the great statesman Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji and Mr. Nehru, who truly displayed what a democratic country looks like, by their joint discussions about law and policy. And, not dragging their differences into the public domain and ripping each other to shreds, which is very, very common in this 21st Century India. To buy MLAs or to make more Statutes ? beggers in our own country. any idea how much the bjp has donated? They're asking for donations because they spent it all on statues. This was a tweet by him and there was no response, I guess.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShashiTharoor/status/1243046184295346179?s=19) Why did they start a different fund called ""PM CARES"" instead of using the PM Relief Fund? How does one go about RTI-ing the PMNRF? The government and its brain dead supporters have no shame A forward went like “ Statues built by Modi are shut till 14th April, the hospitals built by Nehru are open 24/7”. They've given all the money to they crony capitalists. Those poor cronies need more money. please dont donate on pm care fund instead give money to nurses and doctors who will provide direct care, pm care fund will be corrupted by corrupt politicians in system Building statues makes up for tourism, but they aren’t really spending their funds on coronavirus for some reason. Even millionaires are donating but the government falls short. Sad, truly So modiji can come one night and boast how ppl have United blah blah blah...u know his speeches and garner praises. They denied the donations that were offered by the UAE government during the Kerala Floods and said that we are not a country that takes donations anymore, but one that gives donations. PMRF has the money,  was made for things like this. Iran has suffered a similar stupidity. Theocratic incompetence. Huehuehue kejrival ko gaali bhi dena hai hai uska kaam copy bhi karna hai. Statutes build ""garima"" of a nation... With this virus and all 2-3 lakh people will die... India has a lot to spare.. De Beers said it best... Diamonds are forever... These statues will stand the test of time .. a feeble human will not. And the circus when Trump came or any vip comes. [deleted] They were using CSR funds for that

I think it was a commencement address given at a college in Bombay. Here is my favourite story regarding Sam Bahadur: 

A young officer was on his round when one of the riflemen did not notice him and missed saluting him.
The youngster got cheesed off and summoned the Gorkha and asked him the reason for not saluting him. The Gorkha innocently gave out the reason that he did not see “Lieutenant Huzoor”.
The youngster not convinced, punished the Gorkha to a thousand salutes. The soldier immediately started saluting…
Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw who was passing by and asked the youngster as to what was happening. The youngster said, “Sir, this soldier had the audacity of not saluting me. So I have punished him with 1000 salutes.”
Sam replied, “Bloody good punishment young man, but ensure that you return each of his salutes.”
For the next two hours the unit was treated to a scene of a Gorkha saluting and the young officer returning each of his salutes. Surgeon treating him for machine gun wound: what happened to you?

Manekshaw: got kicked by a mule sir! Any idea where I can get a factual yet entertaining book to know more about the Bangladesh liberation war? “I’m always ready, Sweety”

Sam M. to Indra gandhi when asked to go to war edit: Manekshaw Don't change the name of towns to their old names. Rename the airports/Hospitals to our heroes. Always loved [this](https://youtu.be/L-tgRl_VK_Q) interview of his. Pure class. Without a doubt, he was a legend.  Super Bawa. Great to see and hear about him after so long.
I had read about him in a English chapter. Great man true legend and a true soldier he treated the pakistani soldiers as soldiers provided provisions and copys of quran and allowed them to celebrate festivals. after the victory in indo-pak war. and most importantly the true human. we salute you sam bahadur! An absolute legend. Legendary! I'm American. Are there a bunch of movies about him like there are about generals/soldiers here in the US? RIP.

Why is a legend though? I went through the wiki and it seems that he just happened to be the in charge during a tumultuous period in the subcontinent. He was a Parsi who spoke fluent Punjabi... God is Great!! One important aspect of this gentleman's conduct: He spoke out against the sexual violence that was a heartbreakingly massive part of the Indo-Pakistani War. He told his soldiers that rape was not acceptable and to not harrass women - regardless of background/religion/etc. Most military leaders of the time considered the issue irrelevant and sometimes - particularly on the Pakistani side (sorry, but it's true) - sexual violence was encouraged, organized, and weaponized. The myth?
What myth? Praise be Also probably the most famous Sherwoodian along with Amitabh Bachchan.

Understandable. I think it's a pretty good move. Tables were turned once upon a time during the Emergency when Congress was in charge.

It's better AAP doesn't stand with Congress because without them they have more to gain than lose. This is Congress' moment of Tethics and AAP isn't going to comply. As an AAP supporter, I admire what Kejriwal is doing in Delhi and he is running a very focused campaign and not trying to get himself mixed up in all this but I also feel Kejriwal should take a bit more stand on this issue, skipping a meet called by Cong is one thing but not visiting students and standing with them is dissappointing but I hope post elections he will be much more vocal in his support. Good move, no need to mingle with congress. Good for them Excellent. Also about time that we stopped treating the INC as the primary opposition to the BJP. This just plays into the Modi-Pappu playbook. One of the reasons these protests have been so hard for these thugs to deal with is that the whole “this is RaGa running the show” trick hasn’t worked. the three stooges. maya, mamta and kejri AAP fans and admirers on this sub, how would you justify this!

Politics,Did Delhi just show us a new Election Template to effectively counter 'Hate' Politics?,46,f2kru3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2kru3/did_delhi_just_show_us_a_new_election_template_to/,10,"Yesterday, as the counting started, I was glued to my TV, wondering about the fate of our democracy and questioning if people would still remain blindfolded. But not much to my surprise, voters of Delhi gave this huge mandate against the decisive policies and stood up with a progressive approach.

Now as the analysis were going on, experts on TV pointed out some really interesting traits of Kejriwal's Election campaign, which were basically some core reasons behind this victory:

>Not getting into communal vs secular scenario

>Made arguments on work profile.

>Assumed a soft hindutva position. Rejected an Idea that is Hindutva but not a belief that is Hinduism.

>Redefined 'Nationalism'. Rejected Bhajapa's version of the same thing.

>Avoided any direct, serious 'Dig' at NaMo

>Avoided Shaheen bagh

There maybe more than these. 

My question here is, are we seeing a new template here, one that other aspiring states can follow as well?",krush_o," Exit polls already predicted AAP's victory. I don't know why you're writing this post as if it's the 2007 T20 WC finals. The most important point you missed, that to counter 'Jai Shri Ram', they came with 'Jai Bajrang Bali'.

Now sangis are confused that how can we make the Ram's biggest devotee a muslaman. The reason AAP's election strategy worked well is because they had really solid and jumlaproof work to showcase. This particular strategy will not work in any other state because as of now they have no development to show. There is no fixed templates. Things do catch up with people. A strategy that worked 5 years ago may no longer work again. There are voters who are fixed voters no matter what. Or once they switch a party they will continue to vote for it .
 Then there are swing voters, these voters too may have made up their mind before the campaign even began.
Campaigns do have an effect on voters no doubt, BJP constantly tried to malign AAP using several traps like trying to move the discourse towards their strength. AAP never moved the battlefield there and instead stuck to their strengths no matter what their thoughts  were about issues BJP wanted to raise. 
BJP tried to expose conspiracies against AAP, using stray shooters allegiance to AAP, arresting Sisodias secretary etc etc. Ultimately those things didn't stop swing voters. This template may have worked for Delhi, but Bihar is a different election and the dynamics there are different. Same applies to WB. 
The best thing they can do is to try to kickstart campaigns and reach out programs early. Choose worthy candidates. Other than that there are poll strategeists for other things. >Avoided Shaheen bagh

I'll start:

Biriyani is just overhyped pulao.

India is actually a better place to live in terms of  healthcare than USA.",TheUnfaithfulUser," We always say India is not a safe country for women..
This statement is wrong...
India is not a safe country for anyone... Vegetarian biryani is a scam. Healthcare is as expensive as US relatively speaking, you forget that American poor have refrigerators and electricity, our poor sleep under tarp sheets below flyovers, but I agree that Indian healthcare is cheaper for the middle class 90% of Indians are stupid, unskilled and unemployable. The ""Bombay spirit"" is overrated.

Friendships in bigger cities are shallower, compared to smaller towns.

People who call Bollywood music shitty are just being snobby. The second point, I agree with but can you please send your address. Looks like we need to talk about the 1st statement. > Biryani is just overhyped pulao.

Disagree. By the way, don't ever say that in public. It's ridiculously dangerous. Biryani is not pulao .
I really don't know about that health care but it's way cheaper than US because it's not controlled by corporations for making money. India is a shit country by global standards  but it's also never boring like Scandinavia. Morality has no objective existence. Its a bunch of commands. It has no true/false value.

- Moral Nihilist OP is actually quite intelligent. 1. Biryani is not over hyped pulao, definitely not the one cooked by my mom.
2. Yes, India is seriously better for healthcare than most countries, maybe not in terms of quality of treatment but certainly in cost. All other things being equal/comparable, it is rational to go for the fairer skinned partner. (The probability of bearing a fairer skinned offspring increases and they don't have to go through the stigma of being dark skinned in a society that probably won't change that quickly). 

PS. Dark skinned here. And facts don't care for feelings. Bro seriously don't say it in Hyderabad or Lucknow or any part of India All these environment protection groups are damn annoying. We don't know how to save ourselves, how we gonna save the planet ? There is no hope for Humans. 

As far as Earth is concerned, it's fine. In few million years, when we are all dead, earth will be green again. There will be new form of life. 

We are just bunch of 🐒 on a moist rock. Let's act like one. Let's not play God/Gods. Let's do what we are got at, throw tatti on each other. British era was better than today's time . Rajma chawal is the best veg food. OP's dick isn't tiny",2020-01-26 23:19:30

Political rumor mills were clear that BJP was going to tone down the NRC thing before Bihar at the behest of Nitish Kumar. Hence Amit Shah's statements of regret at the communal turn in Delhi elections.

Next, all eyes were on New Delhi because of Trump. Consequently, these riots are front page stores in NYT. At any other time, it might have been on the 'World' page or heck, not covered at all.

So the timing of this is very off. 

Internal factions fighting for control within BJP? Or has BJP lost control over its rogue elements? TimesNow and Republic are saying that this riots is because of social activists spreading fake news on Twitter. Again from Gujarat playbook. Modi kept blaming the media for inciting the riots when his own party leaders were involved. #BREAKING

Three stories which will make your day.

 1. Premkant saved lives of six muslims neighbours when crowd put their home on fire. One old lady was still stuck, he got burnt while saving her. His situation is critical after 70% burn, but Prem is happy that he saved mom of his friend.

Anyone who needs a place to stay in Northeast Delhi or any family who needs any help, please feel free to contact me. Our houses are ALWAYS open. Forward it to anyone looking for a place.

https://twitter.com/kawalpreetdu/status/1231993832138395649?s=19 A friend of mine from Miranda House just told me that there is a presence of a mob with guns rallying around University Campus. Can't confirm yet though. Some people in my area are calling ""Kattar hindus"" for meeting in temple , they are the reason why riots are happening in my area , hopefully now the police forces has arrived here Just imagine if BJP had won delhi..... I was co-ordinating with a doctor at Al Hind Hosp for medicines yesterday. By the time I called back and said medicines arranged but will take some time, he said- “par mera bhai to mar gaya” (But my brother is dead) and broke down on the phone with me, a stranger.

https://twitter.com/atti_cus/status/1232490621031464962?s=19 Just so you know, the Solicitor General of India is spending your taxes to fight against the filing of FIRs for hate speech in the Delhi High Court. The SC has washed its hands of the matter. Stop looking to the Courts to save you. They are already compromised. I am having a hard time figuring out what's true and what is not anymore.

https://twitter.com/ethicalsid/status/1232619319810502656?s=19 >No one, be it any party, should be spared if they are responsible for inciting violence. Even if he is a part of my cabinet, he should be punished. If anyone from AAP is found guilty, they should get double the punishment.

- Arvind Kejriwal In one part of Delhi, a gurdwara opens its doors to Muslims and anyone who needs shelter.
In Seelampur, Dalits blocked the roads against mobs, sheltered their Muslim neighbours.

Police and politicians have forgotten their duty; but the people have courage and heart.

so true History repeats itself. From the Sikh Massacre of 1984 in Delhi to Gujrat, and so on. The silver lining here being that many people are connected via the net and social media. Until things are resolved, everything MUST be documented and archived. The government and Delhi police must be held accountable for continuously allowing mob rule and, yet again, failing to protect it's citizens. Over 200 million Muslims call India home. Widespread anti-Muslim mob violence has killed at least 27 and injured many more. Trump responds by saying, ""That's up to India."" This is a failure of leadership on human rights.

https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1232763321163579395?s=19 How did @DelhiPolice grant Kapil Mishra the permission for a ""peace march"" y'day after everything that has happened? Or was the march taken out without permission?

RTI to @DCPNewDelhi who seems eager to give permission to Kapil Mishra but was prompt in rejecting my request.

>The trope of “police isn’t under me” is old now. U sat at the LG’s residence earlier. 

>What’s stopping u now?

https://twitter.com/SaketGokhale/status/1231968726657818624?s=19 Man, when we said we wanted to relive the 90s, we meant Swat Kats and Jungle Book, not riots I don't understand the wisdom of Kapil Mishra's threats on the eve of Trump's visit. BJP top brass would have known that any violence right now will taint all the positive international press Modi would have received. 

All this signals is that Modi isn't a strong enough leader to keep the city that's hosting the most powerful man in the world peaceful

Surely BJP wouldn't sabotage themselves like this? Elections are over. Amit Shah even made reconciliatory noises after Delhi elections. 

So why now? My uncle's car and bikes were burnt right outside his house in Yamuna Vihar. A rabid, violent mob was going to burn his house also. The BJP councilor living next door has friendly relations with him. He requested the mob to let the family leave. They barely managed to escape.

...and this is a privileged muslim, imagine the plight of the poor without any relations with terrorists of BJP https://twitter.com/BDUTT/status/1232274028045332486?s=19

With all respect to the police constable who lost his life & a few good men doing their job, please look at this video from yesterday. The police not just do nothing to stop the mob from pelting stones, it  appears to charge with the mob as they race to attack #DelhiViolence Situation getting bad in nearby areas of shaheen bagh.

 There are only 3 Indian CM's who have successfully stopped full blown riots in their State  

1) Jyoti Basu (1984 & 1992)   

2) Lalu Prasad Yadav (1990 - Arrested Advani & stopped his Rath yatra)  

3) Pinarayi Vijayan (2018 - Arrested more than 3500 Sanghis during Sabarimala Protest) Seven people, including a head constable, were killed and several others injured as violence spiralled over the amended citizenship law in northeast Delhi. Section 144 has been imposed in northeast Delhi for one month while home minister Amit Shah has called a meeting with Delhi CM, LG and other leaders.

https://twitter.com/NrcProtest/status/1232389094325379072?s=19 Hindus were not under any khatra in 2014 (at that time, it was sabka vikas). 

But they are in khatra in 2020

So 6 years of Modi government put Hindus in khatra. Really makes you think Today one of my co-worker, a die-hard BJP supporter, despite knowing I am from Shaheen Bagh said to my face that he wished someone took tractor and ran over the protestors in Shaheen Bagh. It just sent chills down my spine. 
Not even once I have heard in office openly support anti-NRC protest, but I get to hear blood curdling hateful things about protest, some people say it loud enough to make me hear it on purpose. 
People have become so heartless, I definitely fear for my life and my future in this nation. I have fear of speaking up and can not imagine being in position where I might be lynched. It is so scary. I don't go to Shaheen Bagh, I don't talk about any politics in office and just shut my mouth. I hope this is not the future. I cant be expected to just shut up forever if I want to live in my own country, I hope someday people are thinking twice before saying hateful things 
I want out. Didn't ask for this. Take your country, make it great or do whatever the fuck you want to do with it, just don't fucking lynch me. Twitter is such a cesspit right now. They keep blaming anti-caa protestors and trying to use it to instigate more violence against minorities. I honestly just really want to cry. I don't have anywhere to rant, so I am just gonna go ahead here. What the fuck has happened to Delhi? What the fuck is wrong with people? Out of nowhere this shit starts happening?! Isn't our capital supposed to be safe any more? Why doesn't the police just arrest these elements and put them in jail? I am so sick of the country burning over this thing for so long now. It is tarnishing the image of the country and is also creating disharmony among it's citizens. I am just so annoyed and angry. With social media this is worse than any part. at least that one whole India did not witness and only heard about it later. This one is a live show and whole India is watching it take place in front of their own eyes. Only the strong hearted will be able to sleep peacefully in this turmoil. 

Bless the poor soul. Hopefully they will learn religion will never come to their rescue and hope this diminishes some of the faith in religion Hear Danish explain what happened exact at Ashok Nagar on 25 February.

I am saddened but this is going to benefit him even further. How could the national capital go down to this level. So, it takes 7 deaths for Amit Shah to notice that there is something wrong with the situation. Nice that we can put a number on it after deciding on what to do as a Government. Fucking idiots. I'm just sad that people are more concerned about members of their own community,party etc getting killed  but not bothered when people from other community,party etc are killed.This sort of selective outrage is quite concerning.End of the day everyone is going to face the consequences from the violence and riots.

The accused — #Shahrukh — went to Jaffrabad where a group was protesting against the amended citizenship law, and opened fire at another group that was on the other side, said the police 
DelhiRiots I don't think they planned it that way, but I suspect the cops are now going to use the right wing violence that they deliberately failed to control as a post facto justification for why the blocked many roads around protest sites like shaheen bagh. It'll be a big fat lie, but the supreme court being what it is, it might actually buy it, rather than punishing the cops who failed to control the mob that was threatening violence for weeks. [Caravan - It should be noted here that all the areas from where violence is being reported are ruled by the BJP. All the areas which have witnessed targeted communal violence—Maujpur, Chand Bagh, Karawal Nagar, Bhajanpura, Babarpur, among others—come the under Karawal Nagar, Ghonda, Rohtas Nagar, and Ganghi Nagar assembly constituencies which the saffron party won in the February 2020 polls. In addition, these four assembly seats come under the North East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency which is represented by Manoj Tiwari, the BJP's Delhi chief. All of these areas have a sizeable Muslim population, enough to polarise the localities.](https://caravanmagazine.in/religion/delhi-violence-north-east-maujpur-jaffrabad-babarpur-muslims-hindu) Authoritarian plutocracy is here to stay guys.

Too choked up and heart broken. [removed] Sanghi: This riot is a conspiracy to lower our image in front of Trump.  
  
Also Sanghi: Pfft! Who is John Oliver? We don't need the approval of a white man! Fuck. I’ve been watching all this as a silent spectator all night and now I’m reading an armed mob is headed from Shastri Nagar to Inderlok (Muslim dominated area) apparently? Really sweet guy at my last company who used to be on my team lives there. Fucking hell. 

Just writing this because I feel helpless and this somehow helps a little. Hang in there buddy, hope things stay ok for you. As a Muslim, I knew people had negative views against us but I never imagined it would be on such a level. I've never felt any form of animosity whenever I'm around regular Hindus.   



I'm thankful to have many Hindu friends who actually know that this is wrong and actively condemn it.  I'm the only Muslim person in the group and they have been supportive.


From the circle of people i interact with/used to interact, I've only encountered one person who is a proper bhakt and spits poison.


Now it's not just anti-CAA, the right wing are enjoying this chaos or feel that the violence is justified because we 'jihadi' people are protesting against a law.


It gives them an immense satisfaction to kill or beat a Muslim. 







And a significant portion of the mass wants this.



A significant number of Indians want a hindu rashtra.



Many will take a neutral stand  and allow this to continue.




I just  want to fucking leave this country. 






Anywhere.



All I want in life anymore is just enough to get by and   a place where people don't want to harm me for my existence.



If such an assault can be conducted in our country's capital city , where even the police are providing assistance to them and the perpetrators do not have to face any repercussions, then no place is safe in India.









Even if you're privileged and have a lot of money, you cannot escape the hatred.



Now I'm  contemplating to drop out my course and seek education elsewhere just so I can leave this miserable place.  This is risky.


I didn't take this option earlier because our financial situation is extremely unstable. 




Don't have any arrangements for funds and we struggle a lot to get by our expenses but I'm willing to take student loans just so I can get out.




I'm still young(20) so I'm extremely lucky to have time on my hands.




Am I thinking straight?



This would make the last 2 years seem like a complete waste.



Does this sound rational or am I making a hasty decision because my brain is exhausted. To those who say the transfer of the judge was predecided, I say that this government's odd working hours are pretty impressive.

From swearing in a CM in the wee hours of the morning to signing transfer papers at midnight, they're all really superb owls. When a Hindu kills a Muslim, it’s “communal violence,” but when a Muslim fights back in self defense, it’s “Islamic terrorism.”

soon enough we'll have no investments in this country, who wants to invest in a war torn shithole? economy,environment,social fabric they have fucked everything A lot of thoughts

1. By this time, everyone knows this was an organised crime. Both parties at fault. But delhi police, which is supposed to serve and protect the citizens is seen on record helping the mob to instigate more violence, and is caught live on video destroying CCTVs that's when you lose hope. Having said that, both parties should be held responsible. 

2. Alot of unrest in common man, frankly everyone everywhere is scared. And like or not, what's unfortunate id that there are a ton of ppl filled with bloodlust and hatred for the other party.

3. The media played a big part in the narrative. Nearly all Indians believe what they see on TV and when your fav news channel is biased towards one side and tries to narrate the whole situation in a certain angle, you're just fueling more hatred into the common people. And the only one who benefits from it is the media itself.

4. The sudden transfer of judge just proves that the government is trying to bend the law, it's a statement that they can do anything and get away it while slapping the whole truth on your face.


5. Economic slowdown is real, and with the added unfortunate events of past few days, expect alot of prices to go up sooner or later, it's gonna take a long to heal.


6. Finally, a question to all Redditors. How do you think the whole situation should've been handled? And what measures should the people and the govt/higher ups should take in the future. And what laws/changes should be created if needed any? https://twitter.com/JamiaMehfil/status/1232032574119112705?s=20 [Someone's report from north-east delhi](https://imgur.com/a/0hwvZLi) >UPDATE : Shoot at sight orders at Jaffrabad remain.

2) Lalu Prasad Yadav (1990 - Arrested Advani & stopped his Rath yatra)

3) Pinarayi Vijayan (2018 - Arrested more than 3500 Sanghis during Sabarimala Protest)

Press Release
26.02.2020 | 11:40 am

At about 12:30 am in the night a call was given for gherao of the CM’s house to demand that effective measures be taken to control the violence being unleashed on the muslims of north-east delhi. At about 3:30 am water cannons were used to disperse the protestors. However, the protestors held their ground. Police then beat up the protestors and detained them at Civil lines Police station at about 4 am. Around 8am police took the 41 detained protestors to Aruna Asif Ali hospital under the pretext of giving them medical aid and subsequently releasing them. However, they have been forced to undergo MLC’s amidst heavy police presence. Lawyers are not being allowed to talk with them. Police has confirmed that they will be taken back to civil lines police station post the MLC procedure. 
Doctors at Aruna Asif Ali hospital are being pressurised to give a ‘normal’ report in the MLC’s. 
President and Treasurer of AAJMI, Shafa ur Rehman and Adv. Areeb Hassan, are among the detained protestors, along with members of the Jamia Coordination Committee and other advocates. 
Peaceful protestors are being treated like criminals. There phones have been confiscated. 
We demand that the protestors be immediately released. There are serious concerns about the health and safety of the detained protestors. So, this *shoot at sight* order, does this apply to shaheen bagh and similar sit-ins? Can we have a thread to collect all the verified videos and photos of the riots? It's the least our keyboard warriors can do for the victims of the riots...

     Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

Do not relay cheap narratives peddled by seed accounts of the IT cell. Tell the stories of all the victims. How are there so many people abusing and bashing muslims and seculars on twitter. Where do they come from, they just keep coming at you with hate and threats, non-stop.. I voted for BJP, mostly because we had no option. Never in my wildest dreams, I imagined that they would act like this in their 2nd term. (They did some shitty stuff in their first term too but at least there were no riots).

I feel ashamed that I voted for BJP. 35 dead till now... 80+ injured ... Shit is bad... :( This is a genocide in the making >Please let’s stop calling them pro CAA. Let’s call them what they are - Anti Muslim. They don’t give a damn about CAA.. they just hate the fact that Muslims have the same rights as them.

At least those middle east countries  the Americans fuel it without bothering their own countrymen but here in India we are replicating it within our own countrymen and think this will not have any consequences to the society's psyche. Today its them tomorrow it will be within your own.

Trump was installed in USA as he simply cannot change the way the society lives there. He can only trouble China - Iran and the foreign nations. Within USA they live under law and order and even powerful guy like Harvey who engages with the best of the best politically /socially has to follow the law and spend time in jail.

Modi is a dumb arse  and seems to be doing the foreign bidding in destabilizing India itself. Sometime i feel he is a Chinese bot as  to why would he himself destroy his own country. I mean you have 200million Muslims in your country where the fuck will they go. if push  comes to shove natural instinct is to fight back. Right now you don't even know about the rapes. This horror only comes out once the riots are over and if the victims survive.

Rashtravadi Kapil Mishra -  Please help Hindu victims

*That's the difference.

Compare and contrast. Gurudwaras helped everyone regardless of their religion. Many other Hindus and Muslims did too.

But the BJP terrorist who started the riots is so shameless in his sectarianism Reports coming of shops of Hindus in Maujpur being burnt. In Kardampuri all shops are being looted and burnt no matter who owns it. Delhi burning! #DelhiViolence  #DelhiBurning

The situation in Shiv Vihar is extremely bad. It has been abandoned by residents completely. However, rioters are ramping there to ensure nobody returns. (1/2)

No police patrol in the area, despite security presence in Mustafabad. So when residents of Shiv Vihar are returning to their home to collect belongings they are being brutally attacked. Looting is rampant in the houses of Shiv Vihar. (2/2)

If it's true, then things have escalated to worse than I had ever imagined. I am tired of seeing these Hindu-Muslim clashes.

I think what the government could have done regarding CAA was to just properly define ""religious persecution"" in the act instead of deciding and specifying which religions face persecution, and then there wouldn't have been so many protests by people misunderstanding the goal of CAA.

Ex-Muslims too face persecution in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and they might not have converted to any of the religions specified in the act. What about the head constable who died due to head injury from stone pelting? Security stepped up in Aligarh as precautionary measure following #DelhiViolence: UP Police official

whole country in chaos, congrats to those voted for india to become next syria super power by 2030 😂😂😂 Is there anything foreigners can do to help stop this? Any human rights organizations we can donate to to fight this? I really would like to know the most effective way I can help.

Edit: u/9rj below has provided some links to organizations that people can support via donations and exposure. And it's important to spread the news on social media, share the horror of the riots (videos, etc) which is devastating, and pressure local governments to levy sanctions against India until action is taken.

This needs to eclipse trump and modi, and that will be a genuine win. BJP will continue spreading this riots throughout the country to build negative image of anti-CAA protesters. Just wait and watch in the coming days. It is only going to get worse. 
1. The women who chanted ""Pak zind****"" 
2. Kapil Mishra hate mongering speech to incite the crowd. 
3. What happened today when they brought pro-caa goons with them and police decided to choose which side they are on. Not a hard guess at all,  they love seeing Muslims getting there ass kicked. 
4. Coming soon. Modi's famed Gujarat Model right here.

2020's 2002 all over again. The RW intelligentsia including ORF chairman Chikarmane, Ranganathan, Yashwant Deshmukh are all spinning this as a violence incited because of the instigation and the mob having no respect for Democracy in the country and making it about Modi.


Do not fall for these Centrists/fence sitters. We have tried contacting ndtv, Quint, telegraph, and few other media houses. But all of them are scared to report live.

mass rape alert. sickening. update says the situation looked peaceful as of now How shameful that our country's capital is engulfed in riots when we are hosting foreign head of state. Pathetic state of affairs from the leadership of the country Where is Priyanka Gandhi now? 0 seats meant no empathy fr ppl of Delhi. Is delhi police allowing this to happen or what..?

They need enforce a curfew or something right now and stop the rioters regardless of which side they are on. We cannot allow our national capital to go in chaos like this. In this video from the violence in northeast Delhi’s Chand Bagh, a Muslim saint shrine appears to have been torched by locals.

Locals are carrying petrol bombs, shouting pro-Hindu slogans while setting the shrine on fire.

Tensed situation in capital

Or how bad can it get in other parts of the country. 

It's just terrifying. We've all heard of Jesus's second coming. We now need Gandhi's second coming. I've seen multiple videos where these terrorists are threatening to attack Shaheen Bagh on the 5th.


What is being done about this (by the protestors)?


Are the protestors taking precaution?



There's  only one thing I expect from the police so let's not go there. Hello @ArvindKejriwal, have you heard of the person who died after being beaten-up by police? Kindly announce the compensation of 1 crore for all those who have been killed in the riots. Unless, of course selectivity and populism is your mantra now.

But when people from the ruling class and majority are breaking all kinds of laws, engaging in acts of terror and acting against the interests of the public and the state, why are we not doing the same. The media, the Celebrities and other influencers are all responsible for widening the communal divisions by endorsing the actions of the majority party. The divide is so large that there is no rational line of thought, people are made to believe what the leaders want them to believe..all reporting is biased and people widely share it and believe it, without giving a thought it could have been doctored. The misinformation is the biggest enemy of the people and it is burning our nation. Ankit Sharma was reportedly stabbed 400 times. That is peak brutality. We want justice for Ankit Sharma and every innocent killed in the riots.

Police is not coordinating with us at all. Trucks are being returned. Vunteers abused. Even when we have got permission. People are pleading us to deliver them food. Children are crying but the delivery process is really slow because police isn't helping. 
Violence is not happening in most but violence is still happening in  some areas especially shiv Vihar. It hasn't stopped. Even going with a police personnel is unsafe there. We were assessing an area near shiv Vihar today and saw Muslim man being attacked. Mob was checking his penis to know his religion. (Military was carrying out a flag March two lanes away) We don't know whether they left him or killed him. They had a spear pointed at him. . When we were passing through that area we were scared for our life. People were staring at us and talking shit.

They started throwing stones and bricks at residents, who rushed to Ankit to help them..."", Ankit Sharma's brother speaking to @WSJ  Feb 26.

> Delhi death toll reaches 23. Three probable theories on why we are seeing violence,

* Force the Muslims to abandon their very successful anti  CAA/NRC campaign that makes great use of potent national symbols like the flag and the constitution. Muslims especially women marching with students, doing peaceful sit-ins with flags and the constitution makes for great visuals. The way to disrupt this is to further reinforce Muslim helplessness by acts of police brutality, mob violence, judicial indifference, telling them that even attention from the world's most powerful country will not help them, scaring away their young allies with draconian laws. Create enough distrust to move muslims and hindus away from openly hindu but not against muslim parties like aap.

* Some one is trying to embarrass modi by showing how inept and helpless he is in front of the international media. 

* This a natural outcome of all the hate mongering and this is how things escalate when you try and tamper with things as basic as citizenship of a country. Why aren't people making dolls of modi/shah and burning them? The most recent list of the dead. 38 counted.

Edit: I had pm'ed him too. He just replied. He is ok ! No violence today right? Hope peace comes back to the capital from today It is highly imperative to amend laws to make the department ensuring law and order an independent body just like the Judiciary. We have come across a myriad number of instances of loss of life and property due to the inaction of police. Within a span of 3 days, the riots have injured more than 200 people and killed close to 27 people. The leaders still seem to be playing the political blame game. I think it's high time for everybody to understand that some situations are beyond politics. Surely CAA is going to get scrapped. Right?


Are they willing to riot and kill thousands if that's what it takes to  not remove CAA? UPDATE : Bhirampuri

the timing of all this doesn't look like a coincidence, it started happening exactly when trump is in india?

now doing all this while trump is in india doesn't benefit BJP? because it will get more international media attention ? so who is actually doing it? Step 1: Burn down houses and businesses of Muslims, so they lose documents. 

Step 2: Accuse them of being illegal immigrants, demand documents 

Step 3: throw them in detention camps, where they will ultimately die. 

Step 4: Ram Rajya! 

Step 5: on the way to heaven, stop to rescue a dog and refuse to enter without it. 

Step 6: Heaven requests documents. >VIDEO : #Chandbagh

Ajit Doval very publicly ""took charge"" of NE Delhi, and was on every news channel meeting the locals, assuring them that things are in control.

Otherwise I fear this will only get worse.

I'm afraid it might be the calm before the storm. Clearly they've shown they can do whatever they want, whenever they want. It can only be over if they want it to be over and I don't see much right now that would force them to stop. May be some international pressure from media and other states but not sure how much they care about it right now. It they want to allow more violence, more violence will happen.

https://twitter.com/kawalpreetdu/status/1233798751262793728?s=19 There is a Modi-Doval vs Amit Shah power struggle and this is Amit Shah causing embarrassment to Modi.

Previously  Doval did the Jamia shooter thing where the guy was claimed as being  from AAP and then after Godi media picked it up his Dad came out and  said they were from BJP (as instructed by Doval)

Before this Shah got Davinder Singh arrested (Doval's man)

All  this because Shah wants to be next PM. Also notice how Modi who loves  limelight has had less of it in this term than the previous one. Just a dumb question, Is most of the violence being in the BJP constituencies won from the recent election or is it like the whole city? I've got some of my family in South Delhi.

I was just wondering also you can use this point in any future arguments with ungles. Essential reading those trotting out ""both sides"" bullshit to defend government abetted right wing violence: https://www.mkgandhi.org/nonviolence/phil8.htm [Noore ilahi update (unverified) ](https://imgur.com/a/UrMDpcs) Delhi is on fire, mobs linked to Modi’s ruling party are attacking mosques and Muslim homes, and the First Daughter/Senior Adviser is tweeting this.

https://twitter.com/mehdirhasan/status/1232812338933379078?s=19 want to clarify something there..  when the protests/clashes take a form of a riot which includes molotov cocktails, acid bags, and pistols.. can we correctly assume that the riots are funded by politicians with a political agenda?  I mean common people would never take pistol in their hands...right? 
man.. the state of politics in India is so fucked right now, very sad. We should use the slogan "" Desh ke gaddaro ko goli maro salo ko"", with more intensity than it is being used by the bhakts because in reality those rioters and brainwashed idiots are the real gaddar. Use their tactics on them. **Ground recon**

Shiv vihar - muslim household - completely burnt - gali 6 to 22 - RAF at crossroads - suspicions of violence between brijpuri road and shiv vihar Muslim households - people not allowed to go around - from shamshan ghat to chaman park - Hindus in adjacent regions are mostly fine - mosques are burnt down - all the individuals fled to chaman park, chand bagh, etc living in various places adjacent to Shiv Vihar Muslim household Haven't there been violence from both sides so why is there condemnation of one side ? I am just asking for an explanation please don't bang my head against the floor .

Stones being unloaded by group of people holding saffron flags. So glad I left this shitty country :) It's not Hindus or Muslims, the people of Delhi are horrible and have a fucked up mentality and this is based off my experience in that city of cunts. Delhi as a whole is easily the worst place to live on the planet. I always supported india. Preferred india over separation or Pakistan. Wanted to contribute to the nation. But 5th August and what followed changed me so much as a person that now i just type Delhi after a day or 2 , read the headlines and move on. I am not affected even in the slightest.

A vast majority of arm chair Modi bhakts from their living room will finally see what Modi's route is doing to India whatever little of it was built in the last 50 odd years. This will stop the blood cry as there is going to be a huge cost for the nation and one which will surely take India 30-40 years behind within a short span. This will make the religious bigots realize  Hindu Rashtra will have to go via the fire route and its not easy to trample over 200mil and just their defense mechanism /survival instinct  in fighting back itself will lead to destruction of the nation.

""

I think Gandhis have some sort of sword hanging over their head and it seems they have a choice between jail time or just lurk around purposely to prevent any alternative leadership. Modi-Shah have done all this to Mulayam / Akhilesh / mayawati and many oolder but corrupt leaders. Only lalu did not bend hence is in jail. 

Hold  fair election without replacing EVM box - result will be astonishing as India is always a fair nation and never entertains extremist ideas.

Congress has always been there middling choice and they have rejected alternative govt of  Morarji / Janta part within  3 years. Next one VP singh got a short term too . But Rajiv gandhi got assassinated so Congress never recovered properly but still kept pace via manmohan singh. My biggest surprise was in 2004  when people rejected even Vajpayee and Advani for a stint which wasn't too bad by any standard and even then  brought back Sonia/ Manmohan.

Hence Modi coming back to power in 2019 after 5 years of disaster 2014-2019  is something i cannot digest could never imagine even with  Pulwama which was by all means a inside job. The mood of the nation as shown in state election in 2018 dec/jan in MP / Rajasthan / Chattisgarh and Punjab was very clear and without rigging they won.

Why do people  doubt elections are a scam now. if they can control Police / Judiciary / Supreme Court and even the armed forces to an extent what makes you think EC is some holy cow ??? who the fuck heads Election Commission - a simple IAS ?  I believe there was no EVM hacking but mass scale replacement of EVM boxes. Thats why the time between each phases of election to manipulate.

Coming to your question Priyanka Gandhi is the leader  India needs in terms of charisma Education / Thinking and attitude.

I understand that you guys hate Modi but atleast don’t go so far beyond that you lose touch with reality. I have family and friends living in Maujpur and nearby areas and their accounts are absolutely chilling.

Dainik Jagran poll| was violence in dehli premeditated to oppose CAA? [deleted] [deleted] It's easy to blame the police when you are not on the ground risking your lives. In situations like this when keyboard warriors are threatening each other in the comfort of another city or country. 
Think of the understaffed and ungeared policemen who wear helmets to protect themselves.

We as a society encourage violence by same policemen when it suits us as the viral video of people being beaten when they boarded the wrong coaches. We still live in a society which legally seeks death for a person. Everyone seems to have ignored and is laughing at the rapist who is trying self harm in a desperate attempt to save his life.

Context of an action is equally important, remember your perspective is designed by the person who is taking the video and it's chronology and the usual yada yada. Imagine you are being shot at or being pelted with murderous projectiles and you happen to catch the person. 

I am not justifying the unprofessional attitude of many policemen but they also come from our society and we need to be better to expect better from them. 

Most importantly stop spreading hysteria which may stop someone from genuinely seeking help and judging a profession from an incomplete understanding. It's clear who's causing the violence now. 

BJP clearly doesn't want any violence with POTUS doing a state visit. 
It's either the opposition or violent Muslim mobs. 

Stop spreading misinformation. The police are doing everything they can to control the violence.

Answers to all these questions is no. Dear Mr Prime Minister,

We speak to you as women of this country, and the women of Delhi – Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Adivasi and Dalit – who are horrified at the atmosphere of violence against women that members of your party have created merely to try and win an election.

– Another campaigner for your party, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Ajay Singh Bisht aka ‘Yogi Adityanath’, kicked off his campaign in Delhi by saying ‘Boli se nahi to goli se maanenge’!

– When the esteemed home minister, Mr Amit Shah asks people to push the EVM button on February 8 with such force “that protesters feel the current”, is he wishing to electrocute the women?

What is this kind of communal hate and fear mongering that you, as head of government, are encouraging, that seeks to make women of all communities feel more insecure and threatened? Vote for BJP or you will get raped! Is this your election message to Delhi’s women? Is this how low your party has sunk?

Mr Prime Minister, you may belong to BJP, but you are the Prime Minister of the country and have a Constitutional obligation to protect the rights of all citizens. When members of your party exhort mobs to use violence and bullets and you remain silent or support them, remember it is you who are responsible.

•You need to speak out against such targeted violence and hate speech.
•You need to take immediate action, including under all relevant criminal provisions of the penal code, against these violence mongering members of your party.
•You need to fight the Delhi election in a manner that upholds the dignity of our Constitution and ensures the security of India’s women. Divide and Rule.

Politics,[Politics] How would India have looked like if it was Subash Chandra Bose who took over as first Prime Minister?,4,ewi9qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ewi9qq/politics_how_would_india_have_looked_like_if_it/,42,"**https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/155944/7/07_chapter%204.pdf**

It was well known he was a hard left individual, with interests in the Russian revolution's Marxist and Socialist policies. He was a patriot and nationalist but never thrived off of it. In my view, it was the best kind of *positive* nationalism wherein you respected and fought for your nation's freedom and dignity but also participated in the active growth of its people from a moral and economical standpoint and did not rely on relentless fanning of the flames to attain unity.

Imagine an India which was built on strong but fair leftist grounds which stressed on equality of sexes, equality of opportunity, **mandatory education**, economic liberation, powerful military and more with equal stress on India being Democratic Republic. 

> Subhash Chandra Bose never interpreted nationalism in its narrow ,perverted and aggressive form. He viewed Indian nationalism from the stand point of  a humanist To3 Bose ,‘Indian nationalism is neither narrow, nor selfish, nor aggressive.It is inspired by the highest ideals of the human race.


There is unequivocally nothing that can really beat this combination of non-exploitative, non-authoritarian socialist country. I know some think-tanks have flirted with the idea of Bose being a ""Hitler"" but one, he was pro-Democracy and two:


> “When I first visited Germany in 1933, I had hopes that the new German nation, which has risen to a new consciousness of its national strength and self-respect, would instinctively feel a deep sympathy for other nations struggling in the same direction.Today,I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish, but also arrogant”

In my opinion, India should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for **mass education**, equal opportunities, equality of sexes, liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty AND THEN gone on to open up the market internationally and engage in (controlled) Capitalistic ventures where you invest in foreign countries and foreign countries can invest in yours, independent businesses can thrive and so on and which will see a surge in not only economic status but exchange of culture with the people of India **ready for such a venture** as opposed to now where most Indians barely know who they are, what their history is and what their culture is about.",Budget-Independent," Something like Cuba and pretty much under a left dictatorship and would have moved in the same direction as Pakistan It's a counter factual - i.e., a logical fallacy.

You have no way of knowing what would have happened. 

Maybe he would have gone the way of Stalin and become an authoritarian dictator. Maybe his alliance with the Axis powers would have meant the Allies bombing India.

At the end of the day, these ""what if"" scenarios are academically interesting but don't mean anything. Might as well read *Gandhi: The Zombie Hunter*. Not this wishful imaginary crap again.

SCB was known a megalomaniac by his political peers. 

A more realistic outcome under him would be India  somewhat like Cuba, crumbling & failing state.

Edit: Some context [here](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/Netaji-Subhas-Chandra-Bose-wanted-ruthless-dictatorship-in-India-for-20-years/articleshow/46980513.cms) I feel like Taiwan or some African dictatorship. Best case scenario people become disciplined but overthrow dictatorship to form a strong economy. Worse case scenario people are suppressed into obedience and have to tolerate all sorts of corruption and bullshit. Current India is heading towards the second scenario btw. [deleted] This is a fun exercise

I think if Bose had made it back and not executed by the British he would've had a grip on Bengal which was were a lot of rioting was going on. His charisma would've trounced Jinnah and the Muslim league in Bengal. Without Bengali Muslims on your side, two nation theory was a much harder sell. Abdul Ghaffar Khan was with Gandhi so Pushtans weren't going to join the call. You would basically have East Punjab and Sindh who would not have the votes to partition.

He probably would've sent any right wingers (both hindu and muslim) to the gulags.

He would've done land reforms in that period which would've altered the societal power dynamics. Perhaps what we see in cities today wouldve be how it is in villages?

I think all the same nation building exercises would've been done the first decade like Nehru did.

By end of 10 years it would be a toss up if democracy would even come back. You would see massive caste violence all across Hindu majority areas of India to take back power by upper castes. A lot of communal poison would be spread by muslim elites in punjab and sindh to usurp power

Women of India wouldve been better off. Once you put girls in school theres no going back.

Nehru and Patel would be under house arrest. Ambedkar would be the upper caste children's boogie man.

The military wouldve been a lot stronger so there would be high chance for coups like in Pakistan.

Oh the North East rebellions would've been put down brutally.

If democracy is your number one goal, this would be a nightmare. If social justice was your number one goal, this honestly doesnt sound half bad. > India should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for mass education, equal opportunities, equality of sexes, liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty AND THEN gone on to open up the market internationally

This is exactly happened in India more or less. Atleast in principle our Constitution as envisioned by our forefathers wanted this. Now practically could it have been done better, sure. Would Bose have been able to have done it better? May be, may be not. What if his successors were not that good? I don't see much difference to what could have turned out, honestly. 

Now would he have been more aggressive in curbing the Sangh and banning the RSS?  If he had, then it could have been a lot better for India. But again I am not too sure. Since he had allied with Axis powers, he would have been tried for his allegiance. India Would have been very different from the present day. 

Given that Indian constitution is supreme, he would have implemented DPSPs in his own way. [deleted]",2020-01-31 11:45:31

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",jasonj2232," As someone who doesn't follow politics thank you for summarising everything that has happened. I was so confused wtf was going on all this time Appreciate the effort in this post Hardly the greatest, but yes.

For once, Shah was *defeated*. At his own game no less. Whatever has happened has for the good.

1. Shivsena is no longer Hindutva party, it has entered into its third phase - 1st - May Marathi/Bhoomiputra, 2nd - Hindutva, 3rd - Cosmopolitan/Mumbaiyya with shades of sons of soil politics. Gives it a lot of space to maneuver.
2. NCP + Shivsena + Congress is going to be a formidable coalition. However, there might be issues when they fight the next election (but that is something way in the future)
3. BJP is on backfoot, but it has room to grow. It is no longer restricted by Shivsena in terms of seat sharing. But it will never get a majority of its own. Tough task ahead. Especially after string of losses in various states. It can think of venturing into new territories like Odisha/Bengal but those aren't a sure shot. It might even lose Jharkhand.
4. This also brings an end (somewhat) to ideological fights. There are only 2 left - BJP and anti-BJP.
5. *Ideology ka dhong band karna chahiye* every party craves power. That is their only ideology. Thanks for this detailed breakdown. As an NRI I can't really seem to trust mainstream news completely because almost every one of them has an agenda or are paid by politicians.  I would give you silver if I had the coins. Here is some fake silver 🥈🥈 People like Pawar, Devegowda, Lallu n the next level like BSY, Siddu, DKShi etc (sorry for quoting on KA names, but i am sure there are others too) are very well versed with how to play the game unlike the pseudo Chanakyas who only know the language of threat & temptation of money. Not always can one win by misusing power is what is being proven yet again here.  **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD** :

People do not vote for parties though (ideally by design). They vote for individual representatives. Thats why I am against the party system. > After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.

I disagree with this. We do not know if BJP promised the CM post or no. Hence can't just decide SS is the one to blame for their alliance falling apart. Though of course that has become or been made the popular narrative.

And this doesn't seem like SP pulling a fast one on the BJP but the BJP committing suicide. 

They won the election.

When SS refused to play second fiddle all they had to do was play the victim card and claim the moral high ground. When the state went to re-election they would have the narrative in their favour.

What I think has happened is that Fadnavis tried to assert himself and bit off more than he could chew. He assured Delhi he would get the BJP a majority on its own. Which is why I think they probably did promise SS the CM seat on rotation basis so there would be no splitting of votes, intending to backstab them when they had won a simple majority on their own. They didn't and that made his position vulnerable. He has enemies within the state BJP, and doesn't get along with Nitin Gadkari. He had to do something*. Then this drama played out. Whether he tried to poach NCP MLAs or Pawar played him, this whole thing happened because of BJP's and Fadnavis' arrogance. 

*Fadnavis owes his position to Shah-Modi. The duo needed him to stay in power so they could influence the state which has traditionally not had good relations with outsiders and Gujaratis in particular due to the splitting of Bombay state and he needed them to remain in power against Gadkari's faction.

lmao 
#WHAAT The game has just begun! The same happened in Karnataka, but look who is in power now. It's a battle for survival for Shiv Sena, and Pawar helped. It isn't going to mean anything more to NCP than having a share in the power of this government. But for Shiv Sena, this means everything. 

Balasaheb was the man. Hypothetically, if he comes back & demands that Sena workers bring him the heads of every Sena MLA right now, their party cadres would do this in 20 minutes. Not going into the character & ideology of Balasaheb ( good, bad, ugly) but this was his pull. Even BJP knew they can't mess with him. They accepted being the lesser power out of two. 

After Balasaheb, BJP realized they could be bigger partner. And, Sena saw the ground slipping. They only have Maharashtra, BJP has the whole country. If they let them become the senior partner, why would Sena survive 10 years from now. 

In battle of survival, you befriend the devils you hate. A bhakt told me that Fadnavis got into CM chair and the first thing he did was to clear some farmer relief fund. Turned out to be true.

But yeah, i still think that was a shit display by all parties. More entertaining than any HBO or Netflix series. > DEMOCRACY IS DEAD

I'm pretty sure Indian democracy exceeds the lives allotted to a cat every week, given the number of times it's been pronounced dead. It's fun to make strong, hyperbolic statements innit.

The mandate was for BJP + SS. The _+_ there didn't work out, so the govt. will now by lead by 3 parties with a combined 48% of the vote share.

Was that really the mandate? Sure, no.

Have all of them proven to be greedy pigs? Sure, yes.

Is it bad for MH? Will we see return of blatant low-level corruption, and knee-jerk cancellation of BJP's pet infra projects? Probably.

Will the effects of this political game play out in the next election? It'd be stupid to expect BJP to not revise their alliance arrangements wrt Shiv Sena.

Ultimately, do the coalition parties represent the largest share of the ~~coalition~~ mandate at 48% of the total votes? If I'm adding 16, 16, and 16 correctly, I'm gonna hazard a guess and say yes? These games don't matter. What matters is keeping the alliance together. This is the closest we have seen to a successful implementation of the fabled ""Mahagathbandan"". Making the Ghatbandan work in Maharashtra will go a long way to proving it's feasibility for the voters. These three parties need to keep that in mind, play the long game, and focus on delivering results for the people. Will solve a lot of their problems, all at once. Well written post.

This is no victory, but a remarkable resistance of ruthless power.

I think that this scenario is similar to what we saw in Karnataka. Fractured mandate, BJP biased governor hurriedly installs a BJP CM. Opponents unite, run the government for few years, BJP uses central investigation agencies to go after corrupt opponents, government falls, MLAs migrate to BJP out of fear or opportunity, BJP comes back to power.

Unless AAP becomes strong, there is no stopping BJP in the long run. This is truly scary & worse scenario.. Pawar has dealt the death blow to Modi-Shah combine. Their air of invincibility has been broken. Modi is not gonna take this loss kindly. The anti-Shah voices in BJP and RSS are gonna be fanned. Shah is vulnerable and the vultures are circling overhead. >all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.

This one is not correct though. ACB has released a statement saying that some open enquiries have been closed against Ajit Pawar, and none of them have anything to do with the Irrigation scam. He has around 40 cases against him apparently. 

Appreciate the effort to articulate the saga entirely, though. Great job. Excellent summary. Thank you !! >DEMOCRACY IS DEAD

Hold on to these grandiloquent pronouncements.  Shiv Sena and BJP are living off the Hindutva votebank and they appeal to the same class of voters. If both of them were to contest elections separately, the hindutva votebank will split and none of them will win. So, their alliance was a convenience to let both parties remain relevant. Dishonouring pre-poll alliance is not against the constitution, so, technically democracy is not dead, yet. What Pawar did...

1)First gets Shiv Sena to stick to 50-50 formula until alliance collapses

2) Then he gets Shiv Sena to quit NDA

3) Then he gets BJP to drop cases against Ajit Pawar

4) Then he forces Ajit to quit & Fadnavis to quit twice within 2 weeks


Pawar ensured that.

A ) BJP have egg on their face.

B ) Get accused of subverting democratic norms.

C ) Besmirched reputations of the highest constitutional offices. 

It is indeed greatest game ever played. Pawar should open a school where politics/chanakya Niti is taught > Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of.

I don't agree with this. The BJP-Sena alliance was rocky since 2014. There was a tacit understanding during Balasahebs time that BJP would always play second fiddle to Sena in Maharashtra.

In 2014 that got reversed. They only went along with BJP because in 2014 BJP had ~120 seats and could cobble a coalition with smaller parties like RPI, Raju Shetty's party etc. etc. Sena had even asked their Central minister to resign (they had some Steel portfolio).

This was a fight of survival for Sena. They got their moment and struck at the right time. Pawar might have helped, but this was mostly Uddhavs doing. Awfully looks like the public's choice was one out of:  
1. BJP wins, The other parties keep their integrity, The public loses big time, BJP reigns supreme.  
2. BJP loses, The other parties give away their integrity, The public loses a little less, BJP invulnerability breaks.  


Given how fucked up leveraging justice as a political tool is (BJP used the accusations against Ajit Pawar as leverage), it seems option 2 is better in the long run. One thing is certain, I'm never going to vote in any Indian election after this! Why bother when your cast vote is ultimately traded by power brokers like this? A part of me still says that even though they lost the government for now, they will one by one pick pieces apart from the alliances. Well yeah, Governors should be neutral by law. Why the fuck is that not the case?

Also, President should be neutral by law, but here we have yet another puppet in the hands of the BJP. Ideology has never mattered. They'd sell their own mothers if that meant they'd get power. How long before the new alliance-trio will collapse? 🤔 Great post and very well summarised!

You should also mention how the Governor imposed President's Rule before the time given to NCP to prove a majority had elapsed, which is another example of how the BJP manipulated neutral institutions for its benefit. Hold your horses though. Picture baaki hai. #EKACH SAHEB, PAWAR SAHEB Amazing analysis, but I don't think using the game of chess as an analogy is appropriate. You can't really cheat in a game of chess. You can't switch pieces when no one is looking, can't make one move and withdraw that move before the opponent plays his. And more importantly, chess is a game for people who use their brain power to play the game with honor and sportsmanship. These fuckers are crooks who won't know where to place a pawn on the board, let alone a king (I have some very good suggestions where they can shove the pieces and the board too, however).

These may be dark days for our democracy, but we are also seeing people sit up and take notice of these underhanded and late-night skulduggery employed by these people. If enough people take notice and decide to do something about it, things can change. And people such as yourself, analyzing and displaying facts for all to see, is the first step towards any sort of positive change. Sharad pawar basically didnt do a thing. Shiv sena is the one that betrayed a pre poll alliance. 


It will be destroyed in next elections, MMW The interesting question here is - Did Ajit Pawar resign first forcing Dev Fadnavis to resign, or did both of them resign simultaneously? All scripted . Thank You for your time and wonderful writing to put this into perspective. What does this mean for the growth of Mumbai ?

Are people expecting growth to be stalled ?
( specially of the metro projects ) This will play out like Karnataka. Just wait and watch. Can we all agree it was a sad month for democracy ? Why the fuck are those guys accepting Ajit pawar back. Why is there no cone or shame?
Dismiss the fucktard. I disagree that democracy is dead.

I rather think this new balance of power will keep it more alive. A good government doesn't run and do good things just because there is a strong ruling party with most votes but also because of a good and strong opposition. BJP is going to watch them like a hawk and they are going to be so much more worried about being corrupt or even appearing corrupt.

These might be old people returning to the game but the game has changed a lot since they played it last. Sorry OP. Democracy is not dead. It is probably taking a nap or is distracted. Once it wakes up, it will stab Shah-Modi in the ass till it bleeds. This combination of  shiv Sena, NCP and Congress was meant for keeping away BJP from the power, though BJP made all its efforts to negate it. But BJP not only failed in its endeavors but also exposed itself . Whole Nation has watched the drama, finally took a deep breath after the decision of apex court.  This episode has paved way for the nation that any party can be kept away for its foul play if there is will. Next big loss for Shah and Modi is coming from TMC in 2021.

I can bet money on this because no one in the state wants Dilip Ghosh as CM, even if they support Modi and BJP [which is why they won so many seats in WB Lok Sabha. People like Modi, not state BJP leaders.]. 

I sense a TMC Govt with outside congress support. And in 8-15 months, BJP will do another Karnataka again? I'm trying to figure what kind of government can I call this Indian government? 

Fascist? Oligarchy? Totalitarian? (not the extremes ofc) I guess it's the combination of all three. No? Would you mind summarising things that happen in India for people like me who are confused half the time and irritated the other half. . Like a weekly blog? :) King Pin Pawar got his nephew out and got back in the house. This was pretty intense , speaking from non political standpoint I have few points to add.

* Posted it in other thread too..Due to this SS+NCP+INC arrangement, INC has managed to break away a perception of being Anti Hindu!  This is a big win for them as there seems to be a major propaganda about them being Anti Hindu.  So all that RAGA's temple hopping and Janeu wearing could not achieve will be achieved by this one move.  This can be a big threat to BJP in future
* INC and NCP just avoided losing relevance.  If they had not formed the Govt, central Govt would have used its machinery to break them away thereby causing INC/NCP more damage.
* Sharad Pawar could have easily joined NDA at the center and got a plum ministry for his daughter and Ajit. But he has decided to leave a legacy for his daughter and I have a feeling that she may play a more active role in MH politics going forward. 
* BJP will have no choice but to launch some true reforms like reduction in personal income tax as they would compete to keep the their popularity up. I think we should wait atleast a year to confirm it. Fucking ninja Thanks a ton OP!

Politics,[Hear me out] Tabliki Jamat incident has screwed ordinary Indian Muslim's life for coming years,384,fva7ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fva7ot/hear_me_out_tabliki_jamat_incident_has_screwed/,112,"Until last week, everyone people, news channels, even the government was focused on battling corona virus. And then, this Tabliki Jamat incident came out and entire narrative shifted from 'everyone against corona virus to 'Indians against muslims spreading corona virus.  Videos(Some of it are true, others are not)  started circulating blaming it on Muslims to spread the corona virus in India. Terms like ""Corona Jihad"" were coined. News channels are running shows day and night how Tabliki jamat members spread virus to remotest places in India. Actions of few Muslim people (Incident in indore and tiktok video of a guy from Malegaon) gave it more fire. 

This is going to have long term effects. Amount of hate that is being circulated on whatsapp groups, news channels, Twitter and other forums is going to last longer than this corona virus fiasco. Many of the people who were able to remain tolerant (yes I am using this word, because they were not liberal only tolerant) of the Muslim people only because they had business relations with them are now talking about cutting off ties with them. Already news are coming where there been attacks on masjid and doctors refusing to treat muslim women. Once this corona virus fiasco is over, no one will pay attention to how Government failed it's duty towards daily wage workers, health workers but this incident will be highlighted and it will be used for political gains. Life of ordinary Muslims in India who had nothing to do with Tabliki jamat will get screwed.",random_____name," [removed] One of friend when he called me told that India has fought the virus very well till know and except Muslims everyone is doing their patriotic duty by staying home ..

My father when he called, me told that Muslims are spreading the virus intentionally because they believe it is sent by Allah to kill evil forces, so they want to spread it everywhere according to their god's wish.. [removed] Yeah why do you think news channels are barking like dogs over this incident? They have found the perfect scapegoat to cover Modi government's incompetence and mistakes. I'm so tired of these media companies who have figured out what type of journalism gets the most TRP. We should boycott their sponsors but a lot of them are funded by politicians themselves which is really fucked up in itself. Muslim man committed suicide after villagers started abusing his family after police came to take his sample.


Test result came negative. What I see in social media is that the anger against the virus is getting channeled towards Muslims for the Delhi incident, Kejriwal for failing to prevent the Delhi incident, Kerala led by communist government for being the state with high number of initial cases imported from communist China and Islamic middle East and then spreading it all over India.. And ofcourse the usual suspects like Mamta, Rahul Gandhi, Ravish Kumar etc for criticising Modi and doing politics during such a time of war like crisis.. [removed] As a Hindu, the most I can say is - the liberal left of Indian society will fight on for your rights. How the first cases of the virus in India happen in the first place? I'm a Muslim Stuck in Goa, I mean every part of India is Blaming like ,"" Ye mullo ne case badha dia "" , ,"" Ye Nizamuddin mai joh Muslims haina unki wajhe se cases aaj itne zyada hogaye "".

I know it's not alright to organise this big event at this time but I'm 100% sure that at 10-15 march whole India were sleeping on this, It's the responsibility of government that why they let this big event get organised at that time. 

But, It's like a dream for BJP to find people at Nizamuddin. They get people to put their blame on and cherry on top is that they're muslim. So they'll do whatever possible to frame it like we tried but see Muslims are bad so because of them it happens. 

It's a nice virus, If this government doesn't do some good measures other than banging utensils and lighting dia and candles then I'm afraid what our future is going to be and I'm 100% sure that people will blame it all on Tablighi jamaat like it's there intention to spread the virus in India. 

Back in 2015, I attended a conference of a Congress MP and I asked him a question regarding India's future economy and where they see India at 2025, that MP clearly said that time ,"" Economy will do fine, It's always on autopilot, we just need to check that it'll stays on its path but I'm more concerned about our social democratic fabric as far as this government ideologies stays in the country, I'm bit concerned about our secularism until 2025 "" 

I thought that time that he's just taking the hype nothing much but now as I saw it, This government never leave a chance to defame the Muslims of this country, not even a single chance, they're create chances and find ways to defame a particular community of this country. Maybe I'm sounding too much but in past 3-4 days every other guy I talked to about corona brings Tablighi jamaat as the main reason for it, No sense in their talking, they don't know what the desiese is from where it spread and came. It's like after sometime in India people will start to blame Muslims for CODVID 19 not china. As a Muslim, I’m angry at how people are responding but I’m also angry at the people who attended this event. Of course this was a foreseeable outcome and now innocent people are suffering due to their irresponsibility and selfishness. Just like coronavirus has screwed my entire extended family's who belong to extreme north and are being termed Chinese, non-indian even when my family has been serving in the Garwhal regiment since the last 8 generations [removed] No it will not. Sensible people know act of a group doesn't make the whole community responsible. The people who don't understand this anyway were too blinded to understand this earlier as well. > Tabliki Jamat incident has screwed ordinary Indian Muslim's life for coming years 

""Hindutva bigotry screwed Indian Muslims"". FTFY > Terms like ""Corona Jihad"" were coined.

The times when Hindus have similarly violated the lockdown practices, you can call it ""Corona vapsi"", ""BhagwaCoron[a]"", ""CoV Raksha"" etc. to piss off the Bhakts. Give it few more days, Media/Whatsapp will find other reasons to hate each other.",2020-04-05 15:56:29

Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",abbawaddadu," Actually, corona virus is a great excuse for bjp to blame all their economical problems on.

Politics,Your annual reminder that India's AYUSH Minister promised in 2016 that we would have a 'yoga-based' cure for cancer within a year.,391,fu1ly8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu1ly8/your_annual_reminder_that_indias_ayush_minister/,43,"Spoiler: We don't. 

Please note, he said ' prevention and cure' and not 'treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'palliative treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'help reverse the effects'. 

> ""There is an institute in Bengaluru. They have found a yoga technique for prevention and cure of cancer. We have collected all documentation and the process is going on,"" Naik told reporters.

[Source](https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/yoga-based-cure-for-cancer-within-a-year-ayush-minister-1291302)



Please note that he said the 'cure' is already in the testing phase and will be approved within the year. Please note he said this is 2016. Please note that he said that the cure had been 'proved' - in 2016. 

> Mr. Naik said a technique for such cure developed by Bengaluru-based Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA) is just about a year away from endorsement from his Ministry.

Please note that the media mocked him and he never said it again, but he didn't apologise for giving India's 14 lakh cancer patients false hope. Remember this when you listen to his and his ministry's comments on coronavirus.

Not related to Ayush. But since focus on psuedo science, actual science failing.AIIMS aren't getting enough funds or not in making That ministry is a joke. They are the real cancer. I dare you to post this in the chaddi subs :p Similarly, some time back, I had seen a  video where Subramaniam Swamy claimed that the original Sanskrit texts are being properly translated and we will soon have a ""vimana"" that flies using mercury as its fuel. 

If anyone has any news of the progress (if any) in this direction, I would be glad to hear about it. For a normal human 1 year= 365 days. But for a yogi, 1 normal human year is nothing. I yogi year= at least a millennia of normal human years.

Politics,Sanjay Manjrekar removed as commentator for support to JNU and secularism? Former India batsman breaks silence on BCCI’s decision,283,fj1m8x,http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/sanjay-manjrekar-removed-as-commentator-for-support-to-jnu-and-secularism-former-india-batsman-breaks-silence-on-bccis-decision/284775/,42,,pitchwin," Don't know the actual reason for the removal, but his comments of Harsha Bhogle not being a cricketer and hence a non expert was of very low standard. This makes no sense. Harsha Bhogle wrote a Facebook post that was even more scathing of the central government. Manjrekar lost his job because he was terrible at it. Period. Even  an idiot with two braincells notice how bad he has been with is attitude and how he was  selectively picking up the team members and rubbing salt on the wounds.  
 
Its been very long time since he sarted this practice. 

There were multiple Twitter trends asking to sack this guy whenever he made it to the news for all bad reasons. 

Its a good riddance .

Dont try to misread the things that are too obvious. Some good news amidst fear of the virus 🦠 I used to mute the channel whenever he was on. Good riddance! Amit Shah's son's face looks quite similar to the pigs in angry birds One of best decisions from bcci in 2020. 1. The BCCI doesn't employ commentators, the broadcasters do.

2. Sanjay Manjerakar has been one of the worst commentators on the scene for a long time. Visit the cricket sub on reddit and search him, you'd find that almost everyone from every country hates his commentary.

So, yeah, as much as I would like to blame BCCI and Jay Shah's unmerited role in the organization for everything that goes wrong, this isn't one of those occasions. This has been a long time coming. dont think National politics has anything to do with it... His commentary is pretty ordinary and his analysis isn't that great either...combine that with dumbass remarks im not surprised at all...harsha bhogle really y the fuck would anyone snipe at him yet thusa guy did...hopefully the dont retain harbhajan singh as they did in england in 2018...ooff that was on the level odf the Hindenburg disaster No, he was probably removed for his commentary. Irrespective of his politics, cricket watching experience is better with him spoiling with his brainless insipid drivel. Kohli got him fired. Period. When fucked up then playing this particular card atleast restores a bit of dignity. He's batting for India again.",2020-03-15 21:52:51

 With all respect to Bipin Rawat but his statement was completely wrong. He was sounding more like Sambit Patra and not himself Armed forced should not act or comment on civil matters, otherwise India will soon become Pakistan with military coup after coup. bipin rawat, modi and amit shah come out with similar sounding statements while completely ignoring the reason(amit shah and bjp's sinister policies, police violence) for people's anxiety and the resultant panic. I don't think that it is a coincidence. The navy chief is right. They are setting the scene for bjp's next move of painting it all as a fault of violent muslims who riot for no reason and who can be controlled by only the saviors bjp and rss. Balls of steel!

https://indiankanoon.org/doc/33034247/ well Modi appointed bipin rawat by ignoring the seniority of officers. maybe this was part of the deal

these are extremely troubling times. what if the armed forces get called on by the central government to do its dirty work inside the country! Don't you know sir, you live in New India, where every institution be it Judiciary or ECI in controlled by Sangh through the duo at the centre. Bipin Rawat dosen't know that. He was appointed straight from the RSS shakhas. He will say only what his master's orders him to say. And previously he made political statement as well. So his statement was made so that Soldier-Soldier bhakts gets morale boost. Yeah what Gen Bipin Rawat said today isn't acceptable. We are not Pakistan. Bipin Rawat will likely become a BJP Rajya Sabha MP  at some stage after retirement and if the BJP remains in government, he will likely get the defence portfolio. Remind me in 5 years. From complete freedom in 1929 to complete control in 2019 we have come a full circle we do pay taxes, we do follow all the rules labeled by government, we do respect our flag and bow to it so my question is why i'm anti-national when I ask for what i deserve. Army Chief does sound to me like he is speaking on the behalf of PM Modi's benifits. This somewhere letting us people think about the changing mindset. shame!! only bobde or the previous cji's comment supporting the govt remains. they will come out soon. Even if it doesn't, their silence speaks louder It's really disturbing to see military leaders speak like that. The military should be free to reject illegal commands from the government - but when Modi decided to override seniority and put Rawat in charge - sort of expected that he would blindly support the Brown Chaddis. former\*

&#x200B;

the incumbent ones should also speak up. Well technically you don't really serve the country but the president who was technically appointed much like modi. So, there is that. Mayyybe elect better people next time comrades.",2019-12-27 00:23:53

I knew this situation existed since early 2010 (probably exists much earlier) & at that time it was sort of a badge people wore to show how much of NPA they carried, which basically highlighted their influence ( getting loasn even when they did not qualify for it). It is just that this information is now rolling out in public. Now the bad debts that Yes Bank has accrued will be written off. Those bad debts are loans to the These folks. Ergo, the Indian government is using public money to give to private corporations The irony is still he keeps getting contracts to build bridges and metro lines. ***Desh k gaddaron ko.....*** Why do we still keep saying Ambani, Subash Chandra? We might as well just say that the tax payers owe Yes Bank so much amount. But lets set the ED dogs upon investigating 2cr which was allegedly exchanged between Priyanka Gandhi and Rana Kapoor And the govt has given Anil Ambani the contract of Rafale jets AFTER whose four businesses have defaulted loans and one of it, the telecom business, filed bankruptcy.

This alone should have tanked Modi's re-election bid but here we are living in a controlled anarchy. But you guys look there, a muslim. What went wrong for Essel group? I thought they were all profitable companies. \*couple windows broken by protesters fighting for rights\*

I'll be running away too kthxbye my loan money is on them While interests on deposits are at an all time low because the banks aren't earning enough Modi and Yogi will not put posters of these rich criminals. Bhakts are very illiterate. Defaulting on loans and running off to Dubai isn’t this how Indian businessmen react? *L e h m  a n   b r o t h e r s* ?

Hatred is what they offer since the beginning if anyone couldn't see this they're blind and hypocrites. It's just sad to see how everyone knows Kejriwal is the last hope of our nation but BJP still succeeds in manipulating some people with Hindu-Muslim, India-Pakistan, Shaheen Bagh etc.

If Kejriwal gets any less than 67 seats this time, I'll lose all hope in the political system of our country. If kejriwal can be a good alternative for Delhi, why can't he be good option as PM? I know he is psycho sometimes but still less worse than bjp. He is not as bad as Rahul Gandhi or congress. I appreciate Kejriwal's work very much but I am just trying to be neutral here. I wish he becomes PM sometime. I want Kanhaiya to form stronger alliance in Bihar and form govt there, Azad needs to do same in UP. If every kid in India was taught to paint, that would be the end of the rich in India. A vote for AAP is not necessarily a vote against Hindutva and CAA/NRC. AAP has never clarified their stand on CAA/NRC, their party (including Arvind Kejriwal) have asked the women of Shaheen Bhagh to evacuate the protest site, refused to meet students at Jamia and JNU, have avoided answering questions related to CAA/NRC. This is gold!! Aren't most radicalized terrorist leaders engineer/doctors/doctorates? And isn't sharjeel also pursuing doctorate? Why an alternative PM option should only come from North India?

Why do people overlook the good work done by leaders in the South. Arvind Kejriwal is like a powerful mayor with very less power as a local govt. KCR, CBN, Jayalalitha et al have done much better work but they have never been made heroes in the national media. Late to the party, but the theme is all wrong.

The sangh parivar knows exactly how important schools are, and how to influence them young. They are already brainwashing young minds with twisted books, and twisted whatsapp messages.

Everyone has their own sense of duty. The people in Shaheen Bagh have their idea of it. The people in the RSS have their idea of it. The people in LeT have their idea of it. We just smash against each other like rocks and whichever rock had more mass and momentum ends up winning, most of the time.

It haunts me to think that Robert Oppenheimer was reading the Gita when he was designing the nuclear bomb ([translating it from Sanskrit directly](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/of-oppenheimer-and-the-bhagwat-gita-lead-correcting-intro-april-22-is-the-113th-birth-anniversary-of-robert-oppenheimer/articleshow/58315807.cms?from=mdr), not just reading it in English). And that he quoted it when the bomb was first detonated.

No, the Gita brings me no solace, not after I read the bit about [how castes should not mix](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=XfOsCRRkDCgC&pg=PA80&dq=gita+castes+mix&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9utuC08DoAhVrIbcAHffyBhMQuwUINDAB#v=onepage&q=gita%20castes%20mix&f=false) and then read about how Hindus desperately try to [mistranslate that bit out](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325153176_The_Cover-up_of_the_Mentions_to_the_Castes_in_Bhagavad_Gita). It's the same reason I can't stomach the Bible or the Quran—if you're [making me the bad guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_of_the_unlearned) before I've even started the book, there's something wrong with the philosophy as a whole. 

I used to really like the Gita until I thought about it and looked at the world around me and realised just how much this text could be used to justify so much more and so much worse than what it was possibly intended to do.

Like all religious texts, it goes well with salt. But I can see how it is useful when you feel desperate and lost. The problem as always is what you do it what you take from it. Applies to all religions. Why the hell everyone links everything with religion? Gita isn't even that religious. Yeah, sorry, I'm out of Camp Kejriwal now. He has clearly gone over to the siren call of religious popularism. 

It's embarassing that I defended him earlier. It looks like most of you haven't even read Gita. It was about a man who was depressed (vishad) and had no motivation to move forward. Arjuna in his own words:

“My limbs sink down
My mouth dries up
My body trembles
And my hair stands on end;
The bow falls from my hand
My skin burns.
I am unable to remain still
And my mind seems to ramble”

Now, sadistic individuals like you might call it Hindutva or something else, those who want to read will read it. I've gained a lot of insight that has helped in my life and career. Meanwhile, ignorant crybabies are going to cry. If reading an epic makes you a ""bhakt', then I don't know, stop reading then. In your dictionary, everything is religion, I guess. Gita's message goes beyond religions. Don't believe me? take Google uncle's help.

Also, crybabies also had their asses burned on Ramayana. To me, my biggest takeaway was to be a kind person, who remains calm in the toughest of times. ""Maryada Purushottam"" is really an important term, given to Lord Rama, because he justified his actions and held himself accountable besides other qualities. To his opponents, he knew they are just people and he even paid them respects and gave us a lesson to be a kind human. It's amazing how a person had this insight thousands of years back, and we still bomb our own people. Now, how many people in this world hold themselves accountable? What's the result? ANGER. You might feel like these are the buzzwords, don't believe me? Well, you haven't learned about life then.

Now, I read great non-fiction books to gain wisdom and how I could apply those things to myself, and be a better human. If you feel that reading books of a particular religion makes you a sanghi or a mob lyncher, I urge you to never pick up a book and spend your time somewhere else, maybe calling people out. Luckily Air is free.How about water and food for the poor? Suggest reading constitution instead. I don't need no blind belief
I don't need no comic relief
I don't need to see the scars
I don't need Jesus Christ Superstar
Don't need Sunday television
Ya bet your life I don't need religion

Let me tell ya something else
I don't need no time for prayer
Don't save no knee-pads for me up there
If your head's alright
Ya don't need binoculars to see the light
Ya don't need no miracle vision
You bet your life you don't need religion I’d suggest watching Seinfeld but okay! Dude Watch the whole video first. D for ... No thanks, i've got better things to do.

But no matter who they are, they all agree - our country is in utter chaos. For right wing supporters like my dad, the reason for this chaos is 'liberal Islamists', illegal Muslims trying to take over India, etc. (you know, the usual right wing rants) and for the left wing supporters, the reason for this chaos are the WhatsApp University passed bhakts who are pro-fascism. But whatever the reason is, one thing remains - that our country's conditions aren't good at all.

If you look  from a foreigners' perspective, India is now a hellhole. Its economy is in shambles, riots are breaking out all over India over the controversial acts of BJP like NRC, CAB, University fee hikes, etc., rape reports are rising with the recent brutal Telangana rape case, Kashmir has been in dark for 4 months now, internet shutdown has now become the norm of BJP and if your area is facing internet shutdown, its just another day in India. Not to mention things like pollution, water running out, environmental and climate crisis, etc.

Its very hard to maintain peace and sanity in minds of people in this pathetic condition of this country. No wonder Twitter and other social media are such a toxic place nowadays. Nobody is at peace, at least in this country, everybody is paranoid, frustrated and angry at each other. Sometimes I just wonder what our country initially aspired to become - a developed nation with money, technology, freedom and peace. And look at what it has become.",Death1s1nevitable," [deleted] The other worrisome part is that this ridiculous nationalism and polarization is growing around the world --- the political fights in US, UK, eastern Europe, Hong Kong are very similar. Shit that gets posted through Facebook, WhatsApp is also similar. We need to gear up. I have a right winger acquaintance who is celebrating Conservative Party victory in UK today.  He thinks economy is fine. And guess what he is getting a PHD from an IIT. Remember Abdul Kalam’s vision 2020?
Poor fella must be turning in his grave now And you didn't even mention the Naxalites! /s

Seriously, this introduction could be referencing the United States, and it would ring true. They can and they do, it's very unfortunate and I got into a heated argument with a bhakt uncle just yesterday. It's a sad situation What did you guys expect after voting for BJP? You never vote for a party whose tagline is ""Ache din aayenge""... A good chunk of liberal democracies across the world are going through what we are going through and there are various reasons to it. It would be very simplistic to just blame one single thing for the predicament we see ourselves in and in the same vein it's not that complicated either. Sticking to India's situation right now, it really is as bad as they say and even more but I would disagree with your assumption that the right wing nuts agree that this country is in chaos and the reason being the media echo chamber all of us are stuck in. Social media is giving every idiot's opinion an outlet where a million other idiots validate it. Do you understand the kind of gratification and validation social media gives to a lower middle class, upper caste Hindu mobile store owner from Meerut when he posts bigoted shit on his FB timeline and gets his peers validation instantly? It's a high man! I am sure you are feeling that same dopamine rush right now when people like this very post. We, as a nation, did not have this even 10 years back and now are struggling how to deal with it. Right-wingers across the world and in India learnt to weaponize disinformation when they were out of power and perfected the art while liberals still operated in the confines of mainstream media where their ideas could flourish and be debated. To put it crudely, liberals tried playing chess with the right wingers while they shat on the chess table and kept flinging poo on their face and all the while liberals kept expecting them to come to the table and play like decent human beings. They will not and they will never play the game they are the weakest in and there lies the problem. How do you make a political party, an ideology and their ardent supporters be moral when being immoral benefits them?

If I am being very honest and go to the gutters I can make a reasonable observation that the years of economic growth and prosperity that this country saw, in spite of all the problems, has been somewhat leveling the playing field for all the castes and communities and that's where the problem arises ironically. Indian society, not your urban centers but the countryside, the tier-2 and tier-3 cities were the upper caste saw their power structures being threatened by the marginal or sometimes even the fictional economic prosperity of dalits and muslims felt threatened. The very fact that money was changing the power dynamics between communities was more insulting to them than anything else and you only need to ask any person from the aforementioned places about their views on dalits and muslims. The very economic prosperity that the Nehruvian India was getting them was also destabilizing the social structure of the society. No more could a brahmin's child could tell a dalit to go fuck off and eat shit or hate on Muslims without being shamed in the media (not that it stopped them) and they resented it. Just like how  the white americans made the deal with the devil (Trump) to assuage their ill-founded grouse with the demographic change, the same deal was made by the upper castes, who have been inherently casteist and xenophobic for centuries, with the sangh to put social order back in place.

We are where we are because of this pact. You give me my social power back and I give you the political power you want to play out your Hindu rashtra fantasies. The larger upper caste population is ignorant and downright stupid to understand the nuances between NRC or CAB or why it is such an horrible act because they need to earn a living and also, coz stupid, but know that the current disposition will give them the power they want that was taken away by a Nehruvian India. So, to anyone still reading this, dariye mat. Jab tak whatsapp pe good morning bhejne ki suvidha hai tab tak ye desh khushali se aage badhtaa rahega. Log protests kare toh kare, inko koi farak nahi padta. Shaitan uske saude pe kharaa utar raha hai toh bass aap iss HINDUstan mai kaise rehna chahte ho woh aap teh karre. It is indeed. Some still think it's an exaggeration though.

Oh and you're damn right about Twitter being a hell hole. The amount of toxicity in there is chilling.

They don't exist. Either IslamoFascist or Liberal. It's like the 90s again. God help us all. We: Solve this issue..


Politicians in India: we solve this issue by forging another issue I'm an anarchist and we're absolutely loving it :D /s Well this country has always been the shit hole! The only difference is before the internet all the shit was happening in the small groups. So people were living in the bubble of their own be it liberals or bhakt. Now internet has given the mega phone to everyone. what’s wrong with the economy? Haven’t heard anyone complain about it. > look  from a foreigners' perspective, India is now a hellhole.

And some foreigner told you this? 

Get off the twitter or whatever stuff driving you nuts or else you will get mentally unstable considering the state of your mental health. 

My grandmother is now 82 years old and she has seen the partition, wars, the countless insurgency and economic crisis (I don't know if you calling this economy in shambles, you would really struggle to find another noun for it) and here we are.

I'm starting to think of avoiding all sort of contact with him but he's also someone who I've known for the longest of times. 

I'm super confused. What the heck do I do? Seeing his posts on defending the current behavior of the government is getting on my nerves.",shyggar," I'd say keep your friendship, but instead of indulging in arguments about politics. Try to understand his perspective by asking questions. Learn the socratic method, let him figure out the flaws in his reasoning instead of you trying to convince him of the opposite. Play devil's advocate sometimes and learn to think like him, you will figure out where he's coming from and when you understand that, you will be in much better position to ask him potent questions. well i got into argument with a bhakt but a long time friend, at the end i told him arguing with you will be pointless let it be bus bhai dosti bani rahe. To which he replied,"" Everyone has a choice"". Mute everything on social media and don’t engage politically. Keep in contact only as a friend. The blind will remain blind. IMO, there is no true friendship possible when there is an ideological / moral difference between two people. I personally have stopped talking to so many people. It's liberating. Go ahead. Remember if they're indifferent towards kids being killed and students being blinded, they're not good people and are highly selfish. Personally, if a friend is a bigot. I block them, and stop talking to them. I'll make other friends. You might be the only opposite opinions he hears. If you keep talking same to him,there’s a chance is a chance that eventually he might see the light of the day On political differences - probably not, but observe how his/her political views affect them as a person. Directly or indirectly there'll be a change. In past few months, I've got rid of several toxic personalities & disgusting human beings from my school group. While a couple of them still remain good friends. No. Friendship extends beyond spheres of petty politics, into the very brutal real world. Friends are some of the most important people you will ever meet. Treat them with care and don't try to lose them, especially not for something so small as differing political views. Almost 99% of my friends and family is andha bhakta, when you wear clothes in between naked people it's going to be difficult. The best thing for you to do is engage in a conversation and just laugh at their ignorance . It works for me Everytime . My friends thought I would change and join the cult but I guess my parents raised me better in every way possible where I was taught that free thinking and having a different opinion is absolutely fine . Don't burn bridges for fucking politicians. You never know that idiot bhakt might help you in times of crisis.  You can't change someone's perspective, certainly not by fighting them. It's especially not worth it when you are surrounded by sanghi. I have a bhakt friend who kept trying to convert me to his side. I told him point blank that there should no political discussions of any nature between us and he shouldn't send me any political jokes, explainers etc., I value him as a friend and didn't want to lose him, so it was necessary. My Father always said ""aadmi kitna bhi chutiya ho contact rakhne chahiye pata nahi kon chutiya kis din kaam aajaye"" which I live by how much of a jerk a person might be politically, socially we should learn how those interest/judgements do not get in the way and we smile back, talk about different things. Going to go against the trend here but I wouldn't lose sleep over ditching a friend and here is why.

What your friend has exhibited is most likely a disregard for the suffering of others because he views them as 'others.' This is often the case with conservatives. Compassion and empathy are traits they generally lack. 

Now how does this relate to your situation. Well for now you guys are friends. But the day something happens to you or you fall into the 'others' category, best believe this guy/girl will not have your back. 

Lastly, what's wrong in not engaging with bigots? Every liberal is not responsible for saving the bigoted conservatives. At most your job is to put pressure on governments to safeguard rights of all citizens. Politics and Ideology are the two things that have the power to make a sane, educated man blind and irrational. politics affect real lives of people around you so yes it's worth losing a dickhead who still support BJP after all this

there's no excuse for being an unbelievably retarded asshole despite education The kind of choices we have to make due to our Divider-in-Chief! Been there done that. Totally worth it. Socratic method. That should work. 

Also, see how he treats people in general. Bhakts are generally assholes, but one of my best friends who is otherwise a wonderful person is a borderline bhakt, and today we had a severe argument over the CAA-NRC shit. She blocked me on whatsapp at one point, but I didn't let her go. I called her and then she told she has some problems irl. So you never know. My entire family, cousins, extended family and all my friends are Bhakts. Can never enter into a rational argument with them. 

What is a man supposed to do? does your friend support laws throwing adults and children into detention camps? your friend may be a piece of shit! Mensutra made a video about this. Check it out You don't get to choose your family but you do get to choose your friends. Unfriend and mute their posts, or stick with it. Don't forget though that the friend of a thief is also called a thief. How can I be friends with someone who supports a party which openly claims they want to murder me? Tell him let's agree to disagree and not bring this up again. At the end of the day, you both have the right to have your opinions. If you feel the friendship has some meaning to you, don't lose it over political differences. It doesn't help anyone. Next time it comes up, just firmly say ""let's not get into this all over again"" and stick to it. I don’t think it’s healthy for you to let your political identity or ideology to overshadow other aspects of your personality/identity. The vast majority of my friends disagree with me on some issue or the other and frankly I love getting into debates with them because it helps me clarify my own views. In some instances, particularly on sensitive issues, there is really not much to gain by engaging in debate so it’s better to move on for the sake of your friendship. At the end of the day I think your personal relationships matter more than differences in ideology. If you are surrounded by people/friends/online communities who are negative about most of the things, then it is a good idea to stop going around them. It is important for your own mental and overall growth. All this negativity on different things being spread needs energy, energy which could have been spent on the welfare of our nation. It is a channelized failure of the energy of millions of citizens of our country, via Whatsapp. 

Think about your personal life goals (the good time it is the new year
) and it is okay to trim down friends/family networks who just spread hate and hate. The most important skill is to learn how to think critically and not to be a Donkey. Yes it is Andhbhakti ka koi ilaj nahi h No In my opinion its not worth losing friends on ideological beliefs. Recently read a piece in print by some Asim Ali regarding this 'cancel culture'

[you-cant-cancel-modi-rss-why-us-style-identity-politics-wont-help-indian-liberals-figh](https://theprint.in/opinion/you-cant-cancel-modi-rss-why-us-style-identity-politics-wont-help-indian-liberals-fight/339096/) I went off social media because my friends supported the Babri verdict. I know I am a fool but sometimes you just have to draw the line.  If I meet a right wing conservative in real life I can be cordial but do not think we could be friends. No relationship is above mental peace. My closest friend was a 'bhakt'. We were mature enough to never be personal with our arguments but I would many times find holes in his arguments. Then recently I should him a video of how everything Modi said was a lie and plus there is no internet in his hometown which he thinks is unfair. Now he is putting anti caa stories on insta and they are much more impactful since he was a known bhakt. You don't need to convince him, but instead try and understand where he is coming from. They say don't lose your friends over politics. I would say don't lose your humanity over friends.  the onus is on both of you to understand each other's view points and come to a real understanding as to why your ideas differ. behind everyone's ideas, there is a lived experience and you as a friend have to understand that rather than branding him a 'bhakt'. there may be many things you dont know about him/his life which you might get to know through this. just like your ideas cant be absolutely correct, his ideas can't be completely misplaced. bridge the gap in understanding before making any decision about your friendship. even if he is just consuming wrong information from biased news sources, then there would be a reason behind that as well - maybe he has always been referring to those news sources since his early childhood days because his parents also trusted those sources and he had always respected his parents' decisions and their ability to think, for one. he, and for that matter no bhakt is going to have his 'come to jesus' moment if you dont show any sympathy for his opinions. it is simply not human nature to be derided for your opinions and be shown a lack of respect for having them and you having a complete change of ideology as a result. your political stance is a stance for respect and acceptance and it starts with your friend.",2019-12-24 17:24:43
Politics,To those saying Congress did not let Scindia grow in the party,328,fgakfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fgakfi/to_those_saying_congress_did_not_let_scindia_grow/,151,"Scindia joined Politics in 2002. 

From 2002 to 2019- Member of Parliament 

From 2004 to 2014- Central Minister 

Since last 6 years -Not Minister because congress in not in power

Since last Year- Not MP, Because he lost an election. 

So have can you say that Congress haven't given anything to Scindia.

He supported abrogation of Art 370 & didn't stand firm with his party's opinion along lines of democratic morals.

He couldn't survive 1 year without power. Surviving without position and power is an important trait of leadership. Some who lack ideology can't survive without it even for one year.

Scindia only has about 20 MLAs with him while Kamal Nath has over 90 MLAs supporting him. Why should Scindia have been made a CM over Kamal Nath.

.",burntcig," [deleted] People blamed congress when himanta biswa left but he proved to be more Sanghi than normal ones. But it clearly looks like Congress top leader is not supporting young leaders although they are nearly 40 50 but they're younger than Kamal and digvijay This son of a bitch apparently wants to be called Maharaja.

Fuck this guy. Congress is better off without him. Today, none is working for ideology ,only for power ! 
To say that one leader is in a party because of his ideology is a mistaken reality. There are many examples in both parties who changes their ideology as per the change in the weather of politics Well it's definitely true that the Gandhi family will never let anyone but loyalists grow in the party. That's why the mother and son duo keep playing tennis with the President's post. Gandhis have ruined the opposition in this country. Still scindia is better than mass murderer kamalnath That Scindia belongs in BJP was clear when he cheered the abrogation of Art. 370 & supported the Hyderabad fake encounter. While this might hurt in the short term, getting rid of RSS wallahs has been long overdue. It’ll help the INC massively. Let the spring clean start now.

Saket on Twitter What's Congress ideology one might ask? They were without power for many years in Maharashtra but they partnered with Shiv Sena which follow ideology of Hindutva which is termed as Sanghi ideology by many. What happened then? Also Kejriwal supported the removal of 370. Is he a Sanghi now? Also what's up with the Congress apologists on this sub. Admit you lost a good leader to BJP and continue It is not about what was given, it is about how much he can bargain right now.

Right now by quitting congress he can put party in much vulnerable position, so he can demand much more even if he has lost election. 

Congress in Karnatak won much more seats than JD(S), still they had to give them CM position because they needed to part of some state governments. In the recent elections scindia was the major reason to achieve almost majority.
In The region he represents he ousted BJP like 17-1. He managed campaign very well but denied CMship, Presidentship of MPCC and now was being denied ticket to Rajyasabha. 

Why did nobody reached out to him if they wanted him to retain in this party. Definitely not nice for Congress party. He is definitely one of those close to Rahul Gandhi. If the Congress party wanted to protect Rahul Gandhi so badly, they should have done everything in power to keep him. CM or President.
Also, knowing that him leaving means you loose power and yet you don't do anything but blame him, shows the lack of leadership or even guidance.

I wonder what people in the top ranks of this party even do? Congress needs to get rid of the entire top management or political group. They are basically useless and the main reason our country has failed so miserably that the fringe is now the majority and people who actually cared about this country, run scared of being lynched.

Rahul Gandhi, even though he is not the president, could and should have done everything to keep his personal clan of politicians close rather then siding with Kamal Nath or Digvijay Singh. These are old horses and it's time for them to leave.
The young leadership should have been in place rather then wait for 10 years for the old guard to stage a coop or comeback.

Don't think Maharashtra or Rajasthan will stay with Congress, BJP is hurt, there support is desperate and with the money and govt machinery in place, I don't see India, I only see Hindu rashtra Anywhere the wind blows the stink follows....right now its the BJP...ten years back its would've been the congress...the Bjp era too shall pass and shit will follow another wind in another direction...stuff like this has been happening in politics from at least roman times...eod its shows the shallowness of these politicians and ideologies and also the complete organisational rot of Indias GOP...the bjp like any party on top just taking advantage of it the same way any party would if they were on top Because Kamal Nath is a 1984 riots accused. I agree that doesnt stop anyone from being in power and is pretty much a prerequisite, but if you ask me, that is reason enough.

https://indianexpress.com/article/india/1984-anti-sikh-riots-enough-evidence-against-kamal-nath-cant-evade-law-now-says-hs-phoolka-5023645/ You could have made him the Home minister or the finance minister of MP or given him a place at the working committee of the party. 

Scindia isn't the only one to be blamed here. He ain't no saint is another thing. Kapil Mishra was also in AAP once

Aasteen ka saap agar nikal do to hi accha hai What bothers me is Congress's lack of a core ideology. BJP is tight knit with it's bigoted ideology. There is more to growth and power for a politician than to just hold a political  office for oneself..

Nice to see true colours of leftists..aakhir aukaat p aa hi gye...the guy was denied the cheif ministers position..a senior position in the state cabinet..as well as being denied rajya Sabha seat..when someone fucks you over this much..do you really think the person won't snap > e supported abrogation of Art 370 & didn't stand firm with his party's opinion along lines of democratic morals.

It's good that people like these leave the party. He should have left/be thrown out when he supported the abrogation of Art 370. 12 out of 19 INC MLAs say that they don't want to join BJP MP & Karnataka INC leaders talking to all 19 MLAs Plus he lost his own seat in the MP election.

Politics,Missing Dr. Manmohan Singh 😞,232,fva9mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fva9mi/missing_dr_manmohan_singh/,79,"TLDR - Singh is King


Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. A party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. A finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. I hope the BJP, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a PR firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like Congress, TMC, CPIM, AAP which have quite a bit of expertise by Indian political standards. I hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

EDIT: https://youtu.be/dkJS01Xl3QQ - Justification for auction of 2G frequency bands at low price.

Also folks telling me this is a low effort post - I put more effort than the Prime Minister and I am not even elected by you. 

And folks speaking about the strong leadership of Marendra Nodi - The over centralisation of his government has resulted in one very incapable man doing a lot of stupid things hurting a lot of people. He is a Narcissist and doesn't care about people. At the same time there is a distinct lack of ideas at the center.",fatherofgodfather," History is written by the victors. 

The wave of right-wing nationalism has only begun and will continue unless nipped in the bud or countered by an equal and opposite wave. The chances of either of those happening anytime soon is rather low. 

This bunch sees everything in black and white - no understanding of the concept of nuance. They have shown that by constantly shitting on the first PM of India. I don't think they will show Dr. Singh much quarter, sadly. The smallest dog barks the loudest I've lived through that. 2013 uttarakhand calamity. The centre was not at all responsive and late af in recognising the severity of the situation. apun ko sardar mangta🇮🇳😤 Manmohan Singh was a great Finance Minister. That's it.

The UPA was no better than the current government. Yes, they are not openly Islamophobic but that's pretty much the only pro they have over BJP. They were riddled with scams and the PM played second fiddle to Sonia. Unless they get their shit together and elect an able leader or AAP somehow manages to woo voters nationally, the current government has nothing to worry about for the next decade. And that's a scary thought. Both of them wouldn't do jack shit to help you in your day-to-day life. Spend time with family, take care of your loved ones and hope all of us pull through this. We simply use these comparisons as a reason to fool ourselves. Maybe people have forgotten Nirbhaya protestor being hosed down and the deluge of NPAs from loans freely handed out during UPA II and the thousand other things wrong with that administration that resulted in the NDA sweeping everywhere in 2014.

Nevermind that he was always subservient to the party and had nowhere near the authority that a Prime Minister should command.

This whitewashing of the UPA is an injustice to history. UPA II and was a colossal failure and so was Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister. How old were you when he was pm? The ungodly bifurcation on AP still haunts the state his cm ys rajashekar Reddy gave away millions in fees reimbursement which encouraged many asshats to open fake colleges and reduced the quality of engineering less than zero, and that's just in my state. Don't be so edgy buddy ,you might trip and fall of the cliff Well he was highly educated but lacked spine. Even his own party didn't give any shit about him. He was misused by Gandhi's and he knew that but still went on serving them.

Also TMC really?? The party which still continues to defecate in name of democracy, whose leader puts people in jail just bcoz a meme was made on her.

Also a very low effort post The way he is afraid of reporters is too much. N now they are reopening case of ndtv again. Claiming that UPA finance minister was great is the most bogus claims that I have heard in recent past. I want to know how we are in current economic scenario go and read about Twin Balance Sheet problem. NPA's where a ticking bomb and they have taken economy down with it. And by the regarding NPA's Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 is one great economic reforms past in last few years.

I do agree that Manmohan Singh was a great economist but he was a poor PM.

And about schemes not favouring poor go and read about Ayushman Bharat Yojna. PM humility in first speech is compared to no one accepting that our health care system is poor and we need lockdown to control the spread and seen nothing as less. 

Without the aura of Narendra Modi how successful would have been the lockdown I heard he wasn’t a good PM, but at least he was smart/educated. Man had THREE degrees Thank God, it's you who is missing Singh. My first reaction to reading the headline was, ""what, did that old man went missing under lockdown."" We don't know what he would have done in his pandemic response. So to compare both the PMs is just wishful thinking. [removed] For a few years now, mood of the nation has been ""pehle Hindu ko bachana hai, baaki sab baad me"" Current government is shit. Last one wasn't much better either. Manmohan was a great finance minister. He had no job in running the country. He was a Sonia puppet for the most part and the government was involved in major scams. There wasn't much anti-islam rhetoric but apart from that nothing would have changed here. 

Heck, like him or hate him, I feel Modi at least had the clout where people listen to him which is important if you want to ask them to stay at home for a month. Manmohan was mocked and hardly even felt like a leader who had control over the people. Apart from the theatrics, lockdown is the only solution. Nothing would have changed here OP is feeling *Missing* with Dr. Manmohan Singh  and 50 others. Exactly. > . Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly

But will it be kind to the rest of the country? me too. Manmohan Singh was great. Everyone else around him wasn't. He was just the right man inthe wrong party. l o l लमाओ Today mudiji had to call him ! Karan Thapar,what a journalist. This is how interviews  should.be done.",2020-04-05 16:01:57

More than 1 lakh people are stranded at the UP Delhi border. Who the fuck will look after them if they contract the disease? Who the fuck will care about them? 

These people are at many times the only breadwinners of the family. Can we be so ignorant, that we readily allow entire families of poor to get destroyed? Some  owners of factories, contractors have simply haven't paid these workers and simply turned a blind eye towards these people. 

People like you and me have plenty of surplus money and resources. There are people who literally completely depend on their next month's salary to run their houses. How do you think would they manage?

Government just abruptly closed down the entire nation. What arrangement did it make so that the poor reach their homes along with their familes safely? It is not as simple as booking a cab or renting a car for them. People are literally walking miles and miles to reach home. Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police. Don't they deserve spending this dark and difficult time with their familes, in their homes?
Try to imagine the immense fear and desperation and the helplessness of these people.

Everybody is praising the Indian government on how efficiently they brought an early lockdown. They don't realize what the poor are going through, simply because the society doesn't care about them. 

Please think  again, if you think my thoughts have political origin.",amanagarwalx," I absolutely see the need for this lockdown. If we don't, this disease will spread unchecked and kill _a lot_ of people, mostly these poor guys who are already malnourished and living in horrid conditions.  

_But_ the government should have first implemented a system where there are daily or weekly food deliveries to the poor. We can't let them just starve. Additionally they should have implemented a freeze on rent payments or a government subsidy for those landlords so the poor aren't burdened with it. Food, water and shelter should have first been guaranteed by the government _before_ the lockdown. 

As for allowing them to go home before the lockdown, that is not at all wise. Because of the inadequate testing done by the government we don't know the extent of the spread within cities. We're fairly confident the spread is limited in rural areas though but even that isnt 100% certain, because again, we're not testing nearly as much as we should. 

But allowing mass migration of millions of people from urban to rural is a good way to make sure this virus spreads rapidly among India's impoverished rural population. And mark you, the healthcare infrastructure in rural India is woefully inadequate. We're already going to struggle with the overstretched healthcare facilities in cities. Rural India isn't even close to being prepared for this. Look at how it's ravaging Italy and the US. Imagine the damage it will do here where our healthcare facilities are inadequate in the best of times, where we have high population density, poverty and malnourishment. 

This isn't just a pandemic anymore it's atleast two disasters rolled into one. We're going to see massive unemployment, we're going to see a lot of businesses, big and small, failing. We're going to see a global economic depression not seen since 1929 and maybe even worse than that. And if this disease gets _really_ bad we're going to start seeing a breakdown of our food production and distribution because the poor that grow our food will be sick or dying in droves. Which means, in India alone, millions of deaths from famine, food riots in cities and a possible breakdown of law and order. Of course, this is a worst case scenario and hopefully things won't get so bad but preventing that means we need to take this virus _very seriously_. 

So if the government is finally taking extreme measures to slow the spread then yeah I support it. I don't support the fact they did not account for the well being of the poor before doing this, which they should have. But this lockdown...it's necessary. 

Look, If we're looking at this realistically, there is no 'flattening the curve' for India. The window for that has passed. Cases will spike and it will overwhelm our healthcare system. People are going to die because there won't be enough ICU beds or enough ventilators. The only thing this lockdown will achieve in my opinion is that it will delay that spike, buying the government crucial time to acquire or manufacture more PPE, ventilators and beds. At the very least they can try to raise the bar on the capacity of our healthcare infrastructure so that fewer people die. The government should have started preparing two months ago, we should have converted factories to manufacture PPE and ventilators back then. But like most governments the world over, they were slow to react. And the price for that early inaction is we go into lockdown now. The choice is being in lockdown now or having thousands more preventable deaths later. Neither are good choices but no one has the luxury of good choices anymore in a global disaster of this magnitude. That's the reality the world over and we need to adapt to this because if we don't _people will die_. 

Guys, we are in uncharted waters here. Every country on this planet will have to take _extreme_ measures to prevent massive loss of life. This is the defining disaster of our time. Even the 1918 pandemic or the world wars did not shut down the world like this has. We do not have history to learn from because this has _never happened before_. I've come back home after a fairly long time and have duly switched my parents' evening diet from Tez to NDTV. So now in have two senior citizens who're as heartbroken as I am from 9 to 10.

Ravish's primetime makes your stomach churn. Hard to believe such things happen in India while we bury are heads in the sand like ostriches. people who just a few months ago were ready to take in refugees from other countries cant even take care of their own citizens, where are all those I Support CAA people now? This mass exodus of migrant workers is what happens when a government is myopic to the point of blindness. A proper plan could and would have prevented this. A proper stimulus package planned in advance, and not one quickly put together in reaction to this, should have been there. This mass exodus has many, many, many problems surrounding it. For one, can you imagine people turning into nomads overnight when food and water that's usually available everywhere is missing thanks to a lockdown? Can you imagine, how these men, women, and children are supposed to *walk* hundreds of kilometers in absence of public transport? It's beyond cruel what the Centre has compelled these already oppressed groups of people to do right now. These migrant workers will also (many already are) face the brutality of lathi-happy cops. With state borders locked, they will essentially remain nomads, unless proper arrangements are made for them.  And, worst of all, these migrant workers, who don't have the luxury to wash hands for twenty seconds with soaps (can't afford soaps, can't afford to waste what little water they have), how are they supposed to remain safe from the pandemic? It's also equally likely that they make take the coronavirus along with them to their villages. And let's not forget that rural public healthcare is already in shambles. Those rushing to fellate the prime minister for his ""brave"" and ""strong"" step do not fucking understand how this lockdown has already disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. [source](https://twitter.com/BucketheadCase/status/1243227045783425024) It’s very heartbreaking , we shouldn’t have even let me be so vulnerable and live pay check to pay check for one meal in the first place Although it's very difficult for the government to *plan it all out* in a ""quick"" decision like what they took, but, they could have been more proactive in addressing the challenges coming out from it. 

YES lockdown was and is the need of the hour, but not at the cost of poor management, which by the way is not all about pre planning. [deleted] #21daychallenge Cant agree more Also with aadhaar details, these migrant workers can be easily helped by the government, But they use our identity only for snooping never ever think of helping the needy. Someone should remind Amit Shah most of these guys will vote in Nov. Bihar election atleast then he will wake up. Donate to the local people who are helping & donating food to poors. If you're in a big city then I guess you can even donate on platforms such as grofers/zomato. There should also be a relief fund setup by your state govt, you can donate there as well. Sad but true. Since the time PM Modi announced about the lockdown I knew that this is going to be a huge disaster. India is not prepared for a situation like this. We don't have the infrastructure for this. Hell, we don't even have the accountability of our people how are we going to implement something that was thought of overnight. It's just the beginning of the lockdown, we still a long way to go and who knows if the situation is better or not after that. Personally I feel that the government should have left at least one mode of transportation open for people to go with reduced service time. Blanket banning all modes is a very extreme step and it seems counterproductive at the moment. These places like the ones they showed on TV  today and other populous stations like Howrah, CST station, etc are huge breeding ground at the moment. Whatever the government was trying to stop is not happening anymore. Because if one goes down we all go down with them. The people are stuck there with nowhere to go, with no food and improper hygiene and whatever services were being promised is not adequate.

The only thing we can do is donate. Help our house help and the people they know. Help the daily wage workers. Godspeed Whats weird is I thought there would be further notifications, clarifications, and announcements by Modi. None so far! 

His dikatats cause chaos and he doesnt turn up to clear things up or provide any sense of direction. The guy just reads what's on screen. Nationwide Lockdown is what happens when privileged people are untouched by poor people's problem. 

India needs self quarantine. Nationwide Lockdown in India is like burning the house down to kill the rat. The rat might give you plague and you may die, but burning the house down will lead to a much bigger catastrophe. rich people brought disease, now poor suffering for no reason. I am really pissed the government did nothing in Feb, oh yes they were busing buying MPs. If we have restricted foreign travel at that time everything would have been fine. Who the fuck believes china anyway. WHO shithole. So whats your proposed solution? What the lockdown meant - ""Stay where you are. Don't move. Or you might help spread the disease"".             
But, what quite a few people thought about the lockdown was - ""Everything is closed off. Go back home""           

The government doesn't want you to go back to your hometown. People that are walking hundreds of kilometres home aren't going to magically earn money once they reach home. In fact, they're only putting their loved ones in danger.           

But yea, I do agree that the govt should've handed out masks to all the poor people for free.

Edit: to all the people that are furious that I didn't even think about food and shelter.. . Well, the only reason I didn't mention it is because the govt WILL and HAVE TO take care of those. The govt. has already began or will be providing free ration to all the poor and needy.  Food is something that will be taken care of. But if the disease spread like it did in US or Italy, there's no going back, for a country like us.

It's a pandemic. Everyone will suffer to various degrees. Either these people should be allowed to go home or they should be provided with food ,water and shelter with basic hygiene necessities else they are at huge risk. Can somebody please think about the alleged infiltrators in remote camps? What's even the medical facility there?
It will be a genocide.
Remember that Anne Frank died of a curable disease, not from a gas chamber. Another surgical strike. So the people who elected a rioter twice are suffering? Shocker! Didn't the government announce a relief package for the poor? I get your frustration with how the underprivileged are struggling but what's your beef with the privileged? They are at home all day so ofcourse they are going to do dumb shit to pass time and keep themselves sane and busy.


Coming to your other rant about how Govt handled the financially challenged people, look there is absolutely no doubt that an immediate lockdown of the country was required. We don't have time for planning everything from A-Z about every section of the society before shutting everything down. I am not sure if you have seen the spread rate for other countries but it's pretty fucking fast.

Yes it is really really terrible and unfortunate about how the underprivileged are struggling and taking the brunt of this whole shitty mess...but do you have a better way in mind that the govt could have handled things? We have millions and millions of such people in our country. It's impossible to make arrangements for them on short notice. Yes, it'd be government's fault if they fail to do something for these people in the coming days/months...but it's way too quick to criticise the government. Do you have anything better?

Politics,Politics meaningless without religion: J P Nadda,52,eje0eu,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/politics-meaningless-without-religion-j-p-nadda/articleshow/73082599.cms,23,,Indianopolice," deport this guy to Saudi Arabia. *Terming religion as a ""code of conduct"" which guides people, BJP working president J P Nadda on Friday said politics was meaningless without religion*. Yeah, because their politics doesn't exist unless there's religious divide among people.

The only thing 'Chanakya' of BJP knows well is how to divide and rule.
Instead of making a country a better place, the country is turning into hell hole of bigotry.

And about the 'code of conduct' thing, what about Chinmayanand. Name a good conduct that your religion makes you do *BUT* an atheist or person from another belief cannot do?
Drinking Gau Mutra doesn't count. Correct. BJP's politics is meaningless without religion. It is the very fuel that runs their engine of hatred and bigotry, which in turn helps them garner votes. Wow, thanks for the honesty Mr. Nadda Aaj kal BJP ka har neta PM ke saath competition kar raha hai 😂 Just like he is meaningless to the bjp > [Jagat Prakash Nadda is an Indian politician and the Working President of the Bharatiya Janta Party since June 2019.He is the former Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare and member of Rajya Sabha from Himachal Pradesh and Parliamentary Board Secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party. Earlier, he was a Minister in Himachal Pradesh Government.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagat_Prakash_Nadda)

Without religion to divide people and to be used as an opiate for the hungry impoverished masses, how can a cynical and corrupt person like him play political games with people's lives. Without religion, people like him will have to do real work and show proof of development. Toh aisa ghinauna insaan kaise flourish karega? = Politics meaningless without religion for JP Nadda I am not in support of J P Nadda, but didn't Gandhi say similar stuff?

There, fixed it for you. Read it somewhere, ""PM Cares. People Pays"".... Modi is an expert in making the most out of natural disasters, pandemics, riots etc.

PM CARES was not even required when there was already the Relief Fund Fucking megalomaniac. I'm not paying a paisa into his fund. I'll contribute to local charities, migrant labourers in my neighborhood. Please donate to respective CM relief funds or legitimate NGOs. Never give a dime to the megalomaniac. Never waste a good crisis We already have the PM Relief Fund which is used for natural disasters, which is decades old, and which has money in its coffers. Why create another fund? And wait for money to come in? And call it PM Cares?? As someone rightly said, In Modiji's India, everything is an event. You have to master two things: Event Management to package it, publicize it, create threads around it, make people emotional & media management to make people believe what is right (apparently) and who the wrong people are. Think about all the major problems that the country faced: DeMo, Pulwama, Corona. Event + Media = Sab Changaa Si Every act of his is a PR stunt. He sees tragedy as opportunity. Have you ever seen a wise person who praise himself? Its part of Pradhan Mantri Punarnamakaran Yojana. Every passing day, Gormint Aunty becomes lesser and and lesser a meme, and more a reality.

Yeh saare humko milke pagal bana rahe hai, madarchod ke bachche. POLITICS.
Why do you think there are Indira canteens and Rajiv Gandhi hospitals or Atal Yojanas ?

It's always the tax payer who pays for it while the politicians stamp their name.

I hope we pass an ordinance someday to stop it.
Maybe name hospitals after renowned doctors, national parks after environmentalists and so on. It’s the shocking reality that both Trump and Modi plays the same playbook in every occasion. The similarities in actions and thinking is really very shocking. curfew janata ke naam. relief pm ke naam.

Why call it PM's National Relief Fund? Why not call it India's National Relief Fund. Jesus fuck, man. Stop nitpicking on the wrong stuff.

There's nothing wrong in the name. All world leaders do this so they can secure popularity until the next elections (ObamaCare, etc). That's fine. Did anybody blast Obama for being a narcissistic megalomaniac? Fuck no! **The problem is the lack of transparency with how the funds are being used.**

Same shit like with the CAA/NRC stuff. Nobody knows anything. Everybody picks up random garbage to join a bandwagon of shitposting against someone or something. STREANH. Central government doesn't require money, period! In case of acute shortage they can print money from thin air, thanks to RBI.

State government on the other hand is dependent on central government to release funds and donations it get. **I would recommend donating to state governments especially non-BJP ruled** (BJP one can get from central easily) due to the political scenario. 

It is sad BUT the politicians would be fine seeing more deaths in other states and use it as opportunity.

In case you don't trust any government, go to private organisations, in which I can recommend [Feeding India](https://www.feedingindia.org/). Because its run by pm . 

Not by CJI , not by parliament,  not by President . 

Almost all the central Initiatives are named after Pradhan Mantri .

Its not new to name schemes and funds after PM . [deleted] So instead of funding money to the migrant workers were are debating whether the name of the scheme is right or wrong. The fkn irony. Posting about the name or showing their plight is for nothing if we don't contribute ourselves and rescue the workers.

Why does delhi looks like atishi😅 8 seats are also too much for BJP. Their hate-filled meaningless agenda against a government which is actually doing good work should have gotten 0 seats. Now we have much higher expectations for development of Delhi. Hope the govt will do same.

Naa mandir pe vote milega ab naa hindu muslim pe. Jo major issues hai they are still relevant(Kashmiris pakistan and radicalization) but this brings joy to my heart to see BJP fall flat on their faces. This should be a wake up call, those under 35 youth that brought modi to power is also responsible for keeping him away from the state governance. I genuinely love my people, once people used to vote their caste. That's it. Today people think in different layers. In the center they want someone like modi who has a strong foot. But they also understand that giving someone ek chhatra raj is also not the solution. Democracy is at it's full swing today. 
P.s. this is just my opinion, I do not wish to offend anyone who supports any party, ideology, political figures. I mean he deserves it.

# Q. Why I'm against a re-run of Ramayan and Mahabharat?

Let's start with this 1-minute clip from ""Shut up ya Kunal Episode 6 - Ravish Kumar""

1-minute clip: [https://imgur.com/a/btZMFpD](https://imgur.com/a/btZMFpD)

**Crowd manipulation** is the intentional use of techniques based on the principles of [crowd psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology) to engage, control, or influence the desires of a crowd in order to direct its behavior toward a specific action.   This practice is common to religion, politics, and business and can facilitate the approval or disapproval or indifference to a person,  policy, or product.  

Sorry to say but I'm against every re-run or any show be it Ramayan or Circus starring Shah Rukh Khan. While you are busy watching these shows you will cry when Lord Ram is left stranded in a jungle and when his feet will hurt after walking so much but you won't pay attention that the poor are stranded on the roads and they have to walk hundreds of km without any food and they are crying because they know they are gonna die. People are accusing China of hiding the actual number of casualties, Well you have no idea what's coming your way. This is the reason why Supreme leader is coming daily and doing stupid live sessions to keep you engaged.

# Q. What's the psychology behind India-Pakistan and Nehru debates?

 Let me introduce you to ""BIG LIE"", A psychological trick.

Hitler's psychological profile:

>His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool  off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some  good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept  blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything  that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one;  and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later  believe it.

The above quote appears in the report, *A Psychological Analysis of Adolph Hitler: His Life and Legend,* by [Walter C. Langer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Charles_Langer) 

>Never to admit a fault or wrong; never to accept blame;  concentrate on one enemy at a time; blame that enemy for everything that  goes wrong; take advantage of every opportunity to raise a political  whirlwind

This is why the Supreme leader never accepts a mistake and keeps pressing on Congress and specifically Congress for everything. IT cells never allows you to cool down. 

# The questions you should be asking: 

1. Why we are not ready to tackle COVID-19 when we had months to prepare? 
2. Why people are stranded on roads?
3. Why doctors don't have PPE kits?
4. Why permission to make COVID-19 test kits was given to a company from Gujrat instead of other 18 companies who claimed to manufacture these kits at a lower price.
5. Why Prime Minister missed the key points in his speech when he announced the Lockdown which created Panic in the country? 
6. Why they gave you only 3 hours to prepare for the lockdown why an immediate press conference was conducted? 
7. Why Centre allocates ₹20,000 crore to develop Lutyens’ Delhi amidst coronavirus crisis? 
8. Why we have not conducted enough tests? 
9. Why  Adityanath Govt Uses Epidemic Diseases Act to Arrest CAA Dissenter?
10. Why Dalits in Modi's constituency are eating grass in this lockdown? Why they don't have anything to eat?

When I think about the monsters who are in charge of our countries all I can think is that the world is doomed So tv shows are stopping the general public from asking these questions? *Oh sweet summer child* I support the showing of Ramayan. Hope they telecast Mahabharat too Saving this post to read later. Does anyone even watches DD anymore ? What is actually scary is that in that Wikipedia article you mentioned...there was a part of Hitler's directions as you mentioned and there were photos shown as an example of his body language during speeches and the resemblance to Modi was shockingly similar. Oh God!! Why i am against a re-run of Ramayan and Mahabharat ?

Cuz you have a vacuum inside your head. You do realize its not govt mandated unlike the lockdown ban. Its been telecasted two times a day, which means.

You have to make time when it telecast

You need to have a connection or arrange for it

You have to sit though for an hour and bear that old production work.

You are not learning anything new, Its been the same forever.

So as you see, the person who is actually watching is putting in way more efforts than the govt.

The rest if the points i may slightly agree, but not when you start with such stupidity.

Edit : What could actually count as thought altering is the revision of historical events, being taught to kids in schools. You are NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST. Stop spouting shit you don't even have clue about and have just read a definition on internet. so people will ask these questions to goverment, if Ramayan and Mahabharat was not re-run. Got it. Thanks 9.
He was asking people to do dharna on 23rd march, when government banned gatherings RemindMe! 1 day Long and short of story modi takes decisions and think about nitty gritty later which is a bad sign.....he should have said it in his telecast that all essentials stuff will be available and more interactions with state govts regard opening and closing time of shops and movement of people. He cant be that dumb that he didn't anticipated that millions will move to their hometowns when everything will be locked which is happening now. Problem is he takes his decision followed by "" wah modiji wah"" by yes men who surrounds him.

I hope I get coronachan Hospital ki condition karab hogi, ghar pe betenge Ok, I am convinced there will be thousands of cases soon. Chinese and South Korean police trained to deal with similar cases at a fairly early stage of the spread. Seems like ours haven't learned a thing from them. Ok, at this point it seems like we're all going to get this some way or the other, either because some ""apun ko kuch nahin hoenga"" dons broke their quarantine, or because our IT companies refuse to allow employees to isolate themselves because the HR's birthday functions and agile stand-up meetings are more important.

Question is, how dangerous is this thing in reality? Let's say it somehow spreads to 10 million people in the next month. What are the consequences? Will it be just like the common cold, where millions of people are infected every year but most of them recover, or will the consequences be worse than that? Because it seems inevitable now that we cannot hope for this to go away and have to prepare for the consequences when there is widespread infection among the population. r/Moronavirus Ye konsa Jihad hai ab?",2020-03-14 12:22:47
Politics,1) Food will be delivered to home-quarantined families. 2) Anganwadi kids will have their day meal home-delivered. 3) Providing better internet services since most people will remain at home. The CM's press meet was a good one. Calm and Assuring.,764,fgfir0,https://twitter.com/CMOKerala/status/1237292537414447105?s=09,81,,Hariii_," In Ernakulam, they are giving Italian food to a (malayali) toddler who came from Italy because the kid prefers that. Why he's trying so hard to make citizens of other states feel jealous?
Making Kerala god's own country. Kerala also has proactively begun sharing details about contact tracing and released two charts that show the movement of confirmed patients across the state before being diagnosed and quarantine that will help contain spread to some extent. Man this Kerala is 50 years ahead. Pinarayi is a great CM, very rational, scientific and a logical guy. Rest of the BJPee chutiyas are talking about gomutra I hope CPI-M revives it's cadres in other states too. We need them to play a formidable part in the opposition. There are not communist party in the hard-core sense now

There are trying to repackage themselves along the lines of socialist parties in Europe His statement was for the people who are suspected patients and not coming forward. Getting treatment, food and internet will make them feel comfortable and not left out. I bet Shylaja teacher is behind this strategy. She is the best health minister we have known till date.

Edit: grammer We'll see a catastrophe unfold whenever this thing hits the ill-equipped and lesser competent states. Rest of India: Hindu Muslim, Hindu Muslim, ANTI NATIONAL!!!

Kerala: feels good to hear about the steps they have taken Haha as long as there's good connectivity, I'm fine. I saw the press con. It was really smartly played, if people of the state work together then it's easy to stop its contagion. Multiple warnings are issued to people who haven't yet gotten tested. And, the charts released are a big help too. Smartly the first priority is identifying the victims, and while identification takes place the government works on the secondary issues such as bandwidth, food etc. Gotta say I was impressed. Who would have thought a communist party will be so good under a democracy Meanwhile in Delhi - no work from home for lazy and dishonest citizens! Commies just doing what Govts are supposed to do. Every state/central govt should learn from Kerala's government. Can someone please point to the link to the twitter thread/video where this was said? 

I am not questioning the truth but the link attached by OP does not say what the title says. When zombies start walking from North, Kerala will be the last ray of hope. Do it for my lifetime, and I will never have to come out of my house. Does anyone else find it strange that large population centers like Mumbai are reporting nothing? In a dispersed and connected world, Mumbai would have showed up by now one would think. Either Mumbai is really lucky or Mumbai isnt checking anything at all.

Damn man, Kerala has serious game and a competent administration that is doing something atleast.",2020-03-10 23:26:21

I don't think so. Bhaiya dikat hain ki humare paas unpadh log bade hain jo inn fudduo ke jhanse main aa jate hain... Modi-Shah are merely showing the true faces of the people around you. 

You win by first winning in your homes. 

If you cant stand up to your family or friends, you don't have it in you to win anything besides maybe awards for boot licking

\*\*\*\*I dont mean you specifically OP but the proverbial you Make them feel guilty at every possible opportunity, there will be internal fights among tadipar gangs about sharing the loots, bringing the whole evil empire down No, I believe BJP will remain at the center no matter how bad this situation gets because there really is no credible opposition right now. They will hopefully lose their majority in the Lok Sabha and be forced to lead a coalition where they won't be able to employ their strongman rule tactics as easily. I can't really imagine any way out of this situation, we are in this for the long haul. Idk man but abhi toh laude lage hue hai Well, Germany did. But on the other hand they also had to go through a holocaust. Hopefully we can avoid that. People like Scindia, Tharoor and others who are against the current leadership in Congress need to get together and do what Indira Gandhi did to the erstwhile Congress. Launch a parallel Congress party - mobilize workers enough so more and more Congressis jump ship and then make their party the default Congress.

Or, you know rebel and get the Gandhis out. Even now, the likes of Tharoor keep saying Priyanka Gandhi is a ""natural"" and bullshit like that. Someone needs to take the initiative and start a rebellion internally. Somewhere inside even i think we might have reached the point of no return from this shit situation,  remember Gujarat post 2002 they came up like a duo of dharmrakshak, though the elections were very near back then.
But still i hope we don't get to see that in the next lok sabha elections people just hailing this duo as their champions. Barely 10 years back in 2009, BJP was annihilated in Lok Sabha elections, Congress was set to rule India for the foreseeable future even after 26/11.

I've always maintained that even though politics can turn overnight, democratic political changes tend to be gradual and sustained.  I thus feel that it'll be somewhere in the middle - Modi Shah will lose some support but won't be overthrown, and India will recover to some extent, with some damages etched onto our memories.

How can we win? Not let passion dominate reason. Virtue signalling is good but the real power lies in politics which should never be forgotten. Keep our heads down, mobilise and spread awareness about a possible alternative to Modi.  Call out the atrocities but not get swayed by it. And most of all, don't lose hope. [deleted] Jab tak WhatsApp mai good morning bhejne ki suvida hai he desh Ka Kuch Nahi Hoga. ( As along as there are stupid forwards being sent on WhatsApp nothing is going to change in this country.) I think at the core all Indians are secular by nature.

Yes there is a building up of anti Muslim feeling throughout but I think if matters get worse to a point where it's riots everywhere, India will show what it truly stands for and I don't think you'll see Amit Shah and Modi smiling then.

Or maybe I'm wrong. Meh.. Congress had scams.
BJP has riots and communal violence.

No, BJP won't come back again. The aftermath of riots and violence have hit hard the humanity of even hard core bhakts. As far as recovering goes, it will happen it always does but the hate between two will get stronger, violence will increase, people will die. Poor will remain the puppets of rich unles and until poor educate themselves. Overall, way too many variables to predict when things will calm down but it will only happen temporarily...riots will continue to happen. They mustn't be 'overthrown' via protests or any such actions because that will set a precedent that would be extremely dangerous because the RSS + VHP + Bajrang Dal etc. will always have huge numbers capable of overthrowing governments. 
If that's not what you meant by 'overthrow' then disregard this part.

Secondly, hardcore BJP supporters have always been hardcore BJP Supporters and always will be. It's the moderates/people on the edge who ensure total victory for the BJP. 

2014: A lot of people voted for the BJP because they were sick of the Congress's corruption, hierarchy etc.

2019: Some instances of violence, Demonetization etc. did happen but even then, people's opinion was that they are not too bad and we don't have an alternative so let's stick with them.

But now, with so much violence and hatred, the moderates will change their stance and most importantly the minority politics has changed (Chandrashekhar Azad, Jignesh Mewani etc.) a lot. And minority politics plays a huge role in the Election Process. Instances of rivals coming together (Maharashtra) have increased so a chance of a Grand Opposition Coalition has also increased. 
The BJP won with a huge margin in only around 150 seats, the rest they won with small margins and way less that 50% votes. With the first past the post system, these seats are easy target for a united opposition. So if anyone has read foundation by Isaac asimov, they would know the main characters of the book are pretty insignificant in the happenings of the story. That's the thing. The story in his book spans hundreds of years and the outcomes are not influenced by one or a few individuals. The outcomes are decided by these big sociological forces like technology, politics, commerce, etc. There aren't heroes at the end saving the day by overcoming the evil. I mean technically there are, but the implication is that that outcome was inevitable, regardless of the character's actions.

When asked about something along these lines I think, Asimov said that he was around for the second world war. Before hitler lost in the end, he was actually winning. He was winning a lot. So for him (Asimov) to not lose his sanity, and make sense of all of it, he had to believe that no matter what anyone did, Hitler was doomed to defeat in the end. As long as gandhi family continues to lead the congress, modi would keep getting reelected as pm This too shall pass. Even i am hopeless but one thing is certain that the wheels of time turn and when they turn even the strongest of dictators who think themselves as kings fall and turn to ashes....maybe i will be here to witness it maybe i won't but it sure would happen. The damage won't ever be completely rolled back because of the changes they make using their unprecedented majority in the parliament. We need a stronger opposition (in parliament, not in streets) As pertinent as the question is, one has to just go to other Pro-BJP threads to get a good insight. People are lauding what's happening in Delhi and saying Muslims deserved it and Modi is a hero. Heck, they may even be praying it continues. Now what percentage of the population feels that way is anyone's guess, but there are still idiots nevertheless who will die for the Hindutva agenda. When the riots come to their doorstep, maybe they'll see different? Or will they get even more vengeful and urge Modi-Shah to annihilate anyone who isn't Hindu? We need the moderates and the centrist to our side. We could never turn the bhakts into votes, but if we get a strong leader, who can get things done, the centrist would flock to our side. Congress lost this election because they were anti-modi and not pro-developement and BJP lost in delhi because they were always anti-kejriwal and not pro-developement. To win the next time we need to spread a positive message and not immediately attack the other side. Attacking the other side always pisses off the supporters who turn up to the pols in larger numbers to ""protect their party"". It will recover the way Germany did.. But after paying a colossal cost. It's going to take a while. An entire generation has been radicalised. They may have some losses at state level.


Unfortunately they have no competition at national level. They will win again in 2024.

Congress is a headless chicken right now. 


Aap doesn't have the political power to win lok sabha elections. 

And the country won't be any better than it is right now under a third or fourth front. 


We the people are truly fucked. We don't have any good choice for good governance. If 2002 was dealt with properly we wouldn't have witnessed this today.

Unless Hindus drop this hatred we will keep repeating the cycle Local democracy must be cultivated. People should observe and vote for candidates who do good work irrespective of their party. A lot of the problems we now face come from hero worship of politicians because of emotional connection. We need to think more about what is good for us and what works in the everyday. India recovered from so many things, Modi-Shah are not exceptions if people feel that way. Hindutva Nationalist or Islamic Nationalist, take your pick?",2020-02-27 04:17:40

Politics,Why is the whole political outlook in India so binary?,9,ew5f0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ew5f0h/why_is_the_whole_political_outlook_in_india_so/,17,"like i have been following politics from maybe 2013 ( like almost everyone born after 2000's), since that point the political situations has been so binary let it be BJP vs CONG in 2014, to today the whole debate on the CAA, NRC morphing into just the right wing vs the left wing. And both these examples somehow boil down to the same two sides conservative vs liberal. Why hasn't any middle ground been formed till now ,i think 7-8 years is a pretty good period for a strong middle ground to have formed.

EVERYONE is free to comment, any political opinion, or ant ideology...",space_newton," When it comes to Fascism, everything becomes binary. All those who opposed Hitler were traitors. All those who oppose Modi are anti-nationals. Fascism thrives on creating a binary. It thrives on making an enemy out of its every critic. It isnt binary

The ones trying to polarize are trying to make it look binary Lack of education 🙂 The underlying logic is that it is easy to provoke people against something or somebody than for something. hating Modi, hating Rahul Gandhi, hating muslims, hating brahmins, hating north Indians, hating America are all easier prospects for people as well as influencers like politicians, media etc. than having a constructive agenda. 

so one hates X, other hates the one who hates X and so on.  World over , this seems to be the same. 
Sometimes, you can't even trace the origin of  this hatred.

As for India, middle ground has not been found in the past 72 years. The Swatantra party under Minoo Masani and others tried hard to create a truly liberal , matured alternative to Congress, under Indira Gandhi. They felt the need also to avoid Jan Sangh becoming an alternative to Congress. And they failed to do that. With some more effort JS and later BJP managed to that. This is a small example to show that constructive agenda is hard to be pushed. if at all, it is mixed up with street-politic tactics like name-calling, fear mongering etc. to reach a wider audience.

Educated or uneducated, rural or urban- all of us are vulnerable to emotions like fear and anger. From my point of view, as far as parties go, BJP is far right extremist, INC is centrist drifting right, and CPI is left-wing, but we don't have any true liberal party - a party for whom social liberalism are like prime directives. All these, when in power, have either been directly illiberal towards sections of society, or have pursued policies whose consequences were illiberal (and I include INC's history of statism and corruption in this).

A strong indicator of party liberalism would be to see which illiberal laws they got rid of, how they promoted liberalism among masses, how much internal democracy they showed, how much independence they gave to police and judiciary.

Answer from all three for all these questions is none whatsoever. there simply isn't a middle ground. [Duverger's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law)",2020-01-30 21:26:44

We want to go national on the basis of positive sentiments for Kejriwal’s governance. With the current feedback, we may lose the municipal polls again. People are comparing 2020 to 1984 (when the anti-Sikh riots took place).”   
>  
>An AAP office-bearer told this paper: “We have lost trust. Many see us as ineffective at best and opportunists at worst….The situation is that because we stayed back, we have lost ground to the BJP.”A party source said: “What you may see is more pro-Hindu statements from some MLAs. Almost all Muslims voted for us, and at least half of Dalits did too. But in terms of numbers, non-Dalit Hindus are the bulk of our voters. There is a feeling that we are dealing with an age-old problem that has no solution, so some may choose to co-opt Hindu sentiments.” They may have been slow to react but goddam the way everyone is piling the burden on them instead of literally anyone else is fucking stupid. People will always be stupid. Police under HM and everyone blaming CM. Yeah sure. Don't have the guts to blame people with all the power, blame the CM who is powerless. Even if AAP is trash, I will keep on supporting them simply because they are far worse than BJP RSS can now threaten BJP that they will promote AAP if they do not bring Hindu Rasthra soon. Oh yeah, thank you cunningwal. Guys, don't let Modi win by criticizing Kejriwal. Remember Gujrat riots 2002? Gujrat police department was under Gujrat government (Modi) and CM failed to take actions. Here, in Delhi these departments are under control of Central government. What could you possibly do if something is not under your control? Do you think Kejriwal is kind of a person who will just let his ppl die knowing that he can stop them??. He is a fucking IITian and he could have done a lot more to make his life better but he chose to work for people. Don't forget he has done a lot for delhi ppl and he is not doing it for money. Think how Modi is leading the nation. 

People are always in the search of that one thing which will make a person look stupid, but they never look for those 100 different things that exist and will make the person look smart. Especially in Kanhaiya case, I will not be surprised if Kanhaiya and AAP joins forces to fight Bihar elections.
BJP was constantly bullying AAP and Kanhaiya for this specific case in discussion. For which AAP gave a go-ahead. BJP's talking point has been AAP safeguarding Kanhaiya and against Kanhaiya BJP has been saying he is accused in this case.

I think that is the reason why Kanhaiya thanked AAP. 

Having said that AAP's inherent problem is the arrogance of AK. He thinks whatever he says or thinks is right. The same has to lead to loss of AAP in Punjab years back and will repeat again if he does not allows others to lead instead he being boss everywhere.

Last but not least credibility is down as we Indians don't care about good work done by AAP, sadly, we care more about our religion and BJP is taking advantage of this.

The most basic right as any living being is the right to live. Things like religion, speech, etc. comes after. In the case of the Delhi riots, AAP does not stand for the right to live for people and is trying to bank on buses, hospitals, schools, etc they made. What is the use of all of this if one cannot live and is being killed? AAP has to speak up openly and not like a scared dog. This is part of politics that AAP and AK are playing and people who supported AAP in the past for openness and bravely for raising issues have been let down. Kejriwal has caved in to the pressures of Modi and Shah. He has given clearance to prosecute Kanhaiya Kumar,Umar Khalid and Anirban. #TurncoatKejriwal and #SoldoutKejriwal. And then watch AAP grab headlines again for their splendid work and win back support by the time the next elections come around.",2020-02-29 12:04:38

Modi will never do that. He will let everyone die but won't do this. Modi and press conference with reporters is something that you would never see in your lifetime If the press conference happens then it'll be sudhir chowdhri complimenting pm on his immunity and the secret of it (mushroom) and how he is so active and fearless like superman.
No thanks i am happy without it Why is there a Ji always attache to his name? If you're going to do that, might as well also say Trump Ji, Boris Ji, Merkel Ji or Macron Ji. Modi giving a press conference, dude there is a better chance of elephants flying to moon. He can go fuck himself. We need an actual pm. >> eminent world leaders

This, your honor,  is the reason why Modi is exempt from your claims. Though many who are exempt are doing it, I remind you that there is double exemption, even special exemption for the subject mentioned. Recently Kerala's opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala(whom we fondly address as 'Sanghi'thala and 'powder kuttappan')  accused our Health Minister K K Shailaja of having media mania for giving prompt updates through press conferences. He also criticised her for 'image building'(probably for working efficiently).

https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/mindless-opposition-chennithala-calls-kk-shailajas-covid-19-press-meets-media-mania-120064

 When he was mocked and trolled for this, Chennithala declared that he was only doing his duty as the Leader of Opposition, offered full support to the government and even conducted a joint press conference with Pinarayi Vijayan, our Chief Minister.

https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/joint-press-meet-kerala-s-ruling-party-opposition-vow-fight-covid-19-together-120608 Even Uddhav Thackeray is doing a better job of addressing the people than this moron. I am curious to read the comments how those  bhakts are going to defend Modi. He will and amit shah would answer all the questions for him...give time....bjp needs a new crisis era promo for elections. Modi ji taali bajwa toh rahe hain..  health is state subject and the state administrations are holding conferences quite frequently.  Central health minister is also holding frequent meetings with the states.

I dont see any merit  in a politician handling a conference on Corona than leaving it to professionals . 
Subject matter experts need to handle the conferences. Le stammering has arrived. he will do that when Ram Mandir is built ter is a limit for something you/we wish for. Modi wets his pants when he hears the word press conference. And even if he held a press conference, he would do so privately and allow only sudhir and arnab inside ;) There's only a so much a rhetoric mouthing puppet can do.
Don't ask him to do what 'leaders' do! Modi and a press conference? Be careful what you wish for. The virus might just decide to punish us for overexpectations. > He should hold daily press conferences and take questions from unbiased reporters 

He is busy planning for next elections..

bacche ki jaan loge kya? He is into Maunendra Modi Mode Please no.. More people will die anticipating another demonetization or something everyday... /s Usey darr yeh hey ki kahin kisiney 2002 ke baaray mein galti se pooch liya to?

No. Boris is more intellectual than most of us. He's got some believe in herd immunity. I don't think I can ever do that.",2020-03-21 02:43:58
Politics,How do you feel about boycotting companies for participating in events supported by other side of political spectrum?,52,emjrit,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/emjrit/how_do_you_feel_about_boycotting_companies_for/,23,"This started with Bhakts giving bad ratings to Snapdeal because the Snapchat CEO was less than charitable when talking about India. Some people abused Rahul Bajaj for criticizing the scare-tactics of government. Now, I see the same behavior in bullying of Zoho owner and Accenture Chennai exec for agreeing to participate in an RSS event. This, in my opinion, is not different from several incidents where speakers from different side of political spectrum have been stopped from giving speeches in universities and other places.

Why is it so difficult for us to accept that there are other people with views differing to ours? Is there a need to personally go after every person who is against you and create an atmosphere where people are afraid of expressing their opinions? I found the criticism of Virat Kohli most amusing because of his refusal to give his views. Forget about opposing our stance, even not supporting our stance is supposedly a crime.

I am a liberal on most social issues in India (including CAA + NRC). But, I can live with certain celebrities or corporate executives supporting the government without boycotting their products and movies. I don't want a country where people are afraid of expressing their views in public. Certainly, the Modi fanatics were the first to start this atmosphere of fear on political topics (on topics like religion, this has always existed). I don't want to contribute to it.

What is your stance on this issue?",Monsultant," Boycotting something is a totally democratic way a population can express it's concern in the political statement of a company.you can join the boycott movement as it's totally voluntary and within personal rights and if it's a stupid boycott not many people will join anyway.
Only thing I see here is people acting ""boycott is bad,holier than thou""
Many people say to alternate to dialogue but behind every political statement a large company makes is loads of money .these people don't care about dialogue or anything but cash We can also start boycotting companies that advertise their products on godi media channels. That way the media houses will be forced to take responsibility for the news that they show [deleted] The Zoho owner doesn't allow a difference of opinion in his company. 
He can't use Freedom of expression as an explanation to shield himself and then try to force an employee to shut up when it goes against his political beliefs. That's hypocrisy.

I am against the cancel culture by the way. 

https://medium.com/@saravanaraja_17675/dear-kannan-gopinathan-i-quit-zoho-for-the-same-reason-where-do-we-go-from-here-6ace2dba7a2a I am mostly against this boycott culture (unless it's ethical and if i can afford to boycott) but not this time. There is political decency and then there is the sang parivar. Their indecent propoganda machine spares no one and has created a toxic atmosphere within our homes. So since 2016 I' ve begun boycotting anything thag the sangh touches. From Patanjali to Zee Tv. Extreme left is as dangerous as extreme right, people need to understand this. Such enablers of fascism get their power from their money and status. Why do you think the RSS invited them over any other sympathizer? It's because they're successful businessmen. When they're attending the event, they're furthering the fascist propaganda by virtue of their successful business. We're running a counter propaganda to remove that power by removing what gives them value in the first place. I try to support Indian companies regardless of their political inclinations because after all the company performance does affect the nation in many ways. If it is a foreign company then I will boycott it. I find it silly. Boycotting a company or losing friends just because they have a political view. As long as their stance doesn't affect my relationship with them, I'm not gonna boycott anything. I totally agree. I am totally against cancel culture and boycott culture. It is utterly stupid and waste of time and energy. Dialogue is a must to progress in a society.

Also, if you cant tolerate an opposing voice or view, let it be right or wrong view, I don't think you have a right to call yourselves a liberal. Stifling or trying to stifle a voice is most illiberal thing one can do. I don't think you can truly boycott things that you are accustomed to. This is just online bullying for eg. Aamir Khan and Snapdeal.

Pretty sure "" uninstalling "" an app doesn't mean a boycott but obviously no company wants to try that.",2020-01-10 09:40:20

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

Politics,How deep does the hatred for Muslims go in Indian society?,268,fbvox4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fbvox4/how_deep_does_the_hatred_for_muslims_go_in_indian/,175,"Met a hindu friend yesterday who runs a business in a small-town that has decent Muslim population (\~20%). He told me all the good things about how he has close Muslim friends. How he COMPULSARILY has to visit 3 of his friend's house for feast during Eid. How when he was looking for partners to play Badminton, most hindu groups didn't take him in but the Muslim guys welcomed him with open arms. How he is welcome into their homes where other men cannot go, (meaning they consider like a family member). So when he told me all this, I expected he will have empathy towards the sufferings of the Muslims since he is close to so many. 

But as you'd have guessed by now, he was a Modi supporter with strong distrust towards Muslims. Although he claimed he is not against them (proof that he has so many close Muslim friends) but he felt they are extremely fanatic (kattar). I kept asking have they ever forced you or anyone to do anything against their wish. If not how can they be fanatic. Whatever their problems it is within their community. He strongly believes Muslims have 'enjoyed' the appeasement politics for many years and got so many benefits. How they want to have 4-5 kids to increase their population. He felt all Muslims should have gone to Pakistan during partition. You know, the usual stuff.

If this is how someone who has close Muslim friends thinks, then what can we say about the majority who have very little connection with Muslims. Every day, every conversation just goes onto solidify my belief that it is impossible to overcome this hate. We will either go the Germany way or the Israel way. Either way the future is not looking good.

TLDR: Met a friend who has close Muslim friends but still hates muslims.",Pessimist-Indian," Welcome to reality bro..... History is rife with instances of minorities being hounded by the majority who doubt the minorities to be a fifth column.  

Several reasons accumulate together to build an edifice of hatred that nothing can break. India saw the worst blooodshed in this century because of some Muslims wanting a separate state. From that moment onwards the onus, unfortunately, fell on the Muslims who stayed back. While many, or almost all Muslims are patriots who are rooted to the soil of the country - they have time and again been let down by the less patriotic among them. The rise in Islamic fervour worldwide, starting from Grand mosque seige in Mecca, Iranian revolution, Mujaheddin war in Afghanistan - has again roused fear in not only Hindus but also others. The exodus of Kashmiri Hindus, the repeated cross border attacks have added fuel to the fire. Identity politics that started in the late 1980s keeps many a party afloat. The party that plays on identity of religion has cashed in on the fractures based on identity. Indian secularism is not the ""laicite"" philosophy of the western world. Therefore lack of Uniform Civil Code is brought up frequently, though the present differences in civil code is innocuous. But is the mind intelligent enough the comprehend such nuances?

European countries who saw the meat grinding world wars have been circumspect in seeing that hatred never rises. But India, as a society, is all forgiving - of sexism, of corruption, of filth, of traffic violation, of casteism. It has been forgiving of the simmering religious hatred. 

I am in no way condoning the violence. But I am saying that the human mind is so fallible to hatred. Conformation bias strengthens the odium, and counter examples howsoever strong they may be, don't alleviate the bitterness.

Just like what The Great Depression did to the plight of the Jews. Just like what World War 1 did to the Christians in Turkey. A conversation with one of my friend.
Her: ""muslims have a rule to not use condoms. That's why thier fertility rate is high.""
Me:""Not possible because condom is a recent invention  and quran was written way before it was invented.""
Her: ""why do you like them so much? Why are you always so keen on defending them?""
Me: ""ahhhhhh........ Wtf are u saying?"" >How when he was looking for partners to play Badminton, most hindu groups didn't take him in but the Muslim guys welcomed him with open arms.

What? Liberal side don't like to talk about this (I'm a liberal too) but it is a fact that Indian muslims have changed a LOT in the last 25 years. Mostly because of Saudi Wahabbi money coming into India.

I lived in Lucknow when I was young. That was a very liberal muslim city. You'd never even see a burqa in Hazratganj. Now, burqas are everywhere and muslims are way more religious

Among my muslim friends from back then, there is a shift within their families as well. My friends (all 30 year olds) are mostly irreligious. But their younger siblings are far more religious and ""kattar"" This is common occurrence with those who claim to have close 'muslim freinds'
 I think they just say this to give some strength to their opinion *""i'm not racist - I have many black friends!!""*

all those Hollywood movies and the many times this is used as a throwaway joke...

yikes! These people are scary. They have no reason to hate and yet propaganda has given them an eternal victim mentality.

Unfortunately these types of people seem to be the majority. Their are idiots on both sides. 
What Godi media has done is simply glorified only the idiots. 
Always a beard guy with red hat appears on Tv debate with radical views pretending to the representative of Muslim community. 

His radical views are showcased as views of all Muslims and that’s how venom spreads. Dude I only see/hear this in the north. I don't see any anti-muslim sentiments in South, except for Karnataka I think. One of my very close friend has pretty much the same mentality. His reason is that before the partition his family was super rich (land owners e.t.c.) but they lost it all to east Pakistan. Though he is very well off (economically) at the moment, he deeply resents muslims. Maybe he assumes he would have been much much richer if those events hadn't occurred.

Recently we talked about the Delhi riots and he had a sort of neutral viewpoint in front of me, but his narrative changes very negatively if I'm not around. I got to know of this double standard through a mutual friend. Your friend's political views may be contradicting his social circle, but the same thing happened during partition as well. It comes down to who your friend considers his ""true"" people. You just met someone who has been brainwashed by BJPs propaganda.

That's what we need to understand.

Most citizens don't want Muslims to be persecuted but they're supporting BJP just because they have been told that the previous Central govt favoured Muslims and gave them special attention.

It's not hate. It's brainwash.

It's not the people. It's the propaganda. People are brainwashed to demonise the collective. ""Muslims"" are the enemy, not an individual ""muslim"". This happens in all the conflicts. ""Jews"" are the enemy of muslims, not a particular ""Jew"". Even in war, the enemy soldier is just fighting for his/her country just as us. But war is not fought with that soldier. Instead it's fought against the invisible, vile, ruthless evil that is enemy. I always believed that Partitioned shouldn’t have happened and we should have been all living in one unified india. I am a Pakistani living in Los Angeles and have a lot of Indian friends. 

Today my views have changed, I am glad Muslims have Pakistan. Can Muslims be secular?

Can devout Muslims be happy living in a state devoid of any influence from Quran or other Islamic teachings ?

That's an honest inquiry, not an Islamophobic comment. It’s easy to say “I’m not Islamophobic, I have Muslim friends” (or “I’m not racist, I have xxxxx friends” and so forth) while still actually having distrust and disrespect for a group. Or to simply say the ones you’re friends with are “different” than the other ones.

It can happen anywhere, really. I grew up in the American South. My mom’s Indian, dad was Iranian. A lot of people who were our neighbors and close friends when I was growing up are nonetheless perfectly happy to support Donald Trump and policies that endanger my family and keep many of my loved ones from coming to America. Similarly I know a lot of Muslims who hate us Hindus. This is actually really sad. God bless our country. There is a world of difference between hating an individual and a community itself. This is clearly seen in your friend's pov. The point he has kept for Muslims as a community is most certainly true as well as the fact that the Muslim individuals he knew were not at all confirming to that Stereotype. Most often we hate communities primarily because we fail to see the individuals.

Take recent Delhi riots, this guy Shahrukh pathan is all over the news for pointing a gun at the riot control police. So of course the Muslim fanatic image strengthens. So yeah mate, the hate in the Indian society maybe definitely deep rooted but if you were to pick up individuals, most of them wouldn't really even be caring when it comes to religion. Very deep! I don't know about Richie rich guys or poor but in middle class, educated urban india, definitely very high. about 70% in older conservative uppercastes.

As your caste and age gets lower, you get less bigotry. 

As your urbanisation and economic independence increases you get less bigotry.

my informal survey among north india uppercaste urbanites shows me that 5-10% are mentally disturbed and have high levels of bigotry. 30% are highly caste group oriented and feel good about pushing for inequality and  bigotry.  20% hate the rss/bjp. 10% support reservations and have some idea of  ambedkar.


30% of those voting for bjp thought that bjp is not communal. That is now finished.

Also, with paper ballots and free elections,BJP will lose Gujarat anytime. Most people do not like Mafia Rule. My colleague who says she's progressive and independent is a Modi bhakt and Rss supporter ironically. She says her whole family including her, hates Muslims. She can't give logical answer when asked why they hate muslims so much. All she could say was that muslims are anti nationals who support pakistan. Islamophobia in India is real and cannot be fought against. Some times I feel like we live in 1935-39 German Nazi era where Germans used to hate jews but were not executing jews yet. I also want to share a incident 2-3 days back one of my relative came to our house, she is a Modi bhakt and was saying some bad things about Muslims for the Delhi riots after few hours one of her friend called her, she talked to her very sweetly and after the call she told us that she was talking to her Muslim friend and was saying very good things about her.


So when it comes to our roots our roots are very strong and it will take thousands of Modi's to make distress in India. 🙏 Muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years. It is one of the major reasons why Hindus are angry towards the community.

With regards to the Population and go to Pakistan points, they are absolute nonsense. 

Indian Muslims are Indians and will remain so. I wish Dr APJ Abdul Kalam would answer all these bitches with one tight slapping answer yet in a humble way Media brainwashing is probably the reason. Your friend did not learn about Islam from his friends, he learned about Islam and Muslim agendas from tv. So he thinks my Muslim friends are fine, but there exists a bigger ideological war in which Islam is his enemy. Brainwashing is a helluva drug.

Something important must have not been taught to these people as they grew up. WhatsApp single handedly destroyed this country.Its shocking when you think about it.

Politics,Opinion of CAA from someone who avoids politics,19,eq0kr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eq0kr4/opinion_of_caa_from_someone_who_avoids_politics/,10,"The decision of the government to allow non-muslim foreign immigrants from neighbouring countries is the most important decision of the year after modi again rose to power in may 2019. There has been a lot of mystery surrounding the act and what its consequences and the worry for the muslim community further increases by the decision to maintain a national registry for which it seems necessary to prove your origin through documents which can be difficult for a lot of people.

A question arises that why the government felt it was necessary to implement such a clearly controversial decision. There was never a need for such a bill that invites immigrants from other countries and the modi government has previously never shown any interest in the hindus in the neighboring countries. So is the decision just a move towards making india a place reserved for just hindus by discriminating against the muslim community. As they couldn’t directly discriminate against the muslims on the basis of just religion as we claim to be a secular country and that would have been a direct war against the constitution so they decided to remove muslims exclusively from an important decision of the government which does not directly affect the common person of the country. So is this decision the first part of the plan of the modi government to radicalize the people to turn against the people of our own country just because they don’t follow the same religion as us. Is modi really such a petty thinker that he would waste the energy and resources of our nation to just push his Hindutva agenda instead of focusing on more important world issues at hand.

After the bill was silently introduced and quickly passed the government has been sitting in the back seat and are letting the events pan out as they can. The top level is not answering any questions and neither are raising new ones by acting as the decision is a good and fair and are letting the people of the country go up against one another. There has been a huge opposition to the act as any thinking person wouldn’t go up against the rights of other people just on small difference but the government has a lot of loyal followers who wouldn’t even dare to criticize the governments decision and the government expends a lot of energy to keep them on their side by circulating propaganda and diverting the issues so they are always in the good light.

But this just feels like the modi government is trying to rise in power and gain more control over the country and we can just wait for his next move and judge the true intention of the government whether it is power or just a more hindu state. So the next four years will be a fight between the common man vs the government and we can just hope that we have the will power to fight it to the end and have the sense to understand the plight that can fall on our fellow men if we fail to do so.",freezingganggang," This is a totally respectable, yet one dimensional POV. Even if Modi’s true intentions aren’t that of creating a Hindu state (unlikely) the hatred has been spread. I’ve stopped counting the number of people I fight with on Twitter everyday, people who DEMAND a Hindu state. His true failure lies here. Unable to curb the hatred. Letting his own pets (Yogi and co) openly talk shit about his country’s minorities. 

Even if an argument is made that he isn’t the creator of the hatred, there shouldn’t be any doubt about him being the ENABLER of the hatred. He is a bad PM and is openly demeaning those who go against him by not even acknowledging them. Kahaan hai democracy? Your observations are correct but you're missing an important part of the puzzle, NRC. NRC has the potential to render a lot of Indians stateless (no voting rights) and that's when CAA comes into picture. From the stateless people all the non muslims would be given the Citizenship back applying CAA. So you'll have a lot of poor Muslims fighting for citizenship in court and we all know how long our court takes and during that time they won't be able to cast in their votes and voila you have a winning formula for BJP. And then comes removal of reservations, implementation of manusmriti and discrimination against SC/ST Look at the exercise in Assam for a trailer on how things might pan out. I think it's an attempt at demographic change to create a Hindu and Pro-BJP votebank in border states especially WB.",2020-01-17 21:47:34
Politics,Can India change following COVID-19?,23,fr1arf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fr1arf/can_india_change_following_covid19/,20,"This question is specifically for the youth of India (people in the 18-45 age range)! Is this our wake up call? Are we gonna recover from this and become a different country? A country of innovators who actually work to make the country better, instead of slaving away for MNCs creating fake digital lives? A country with strong fundamentals where the officials are accountable. Where we ask questions to the state. Where the government becomes the serving class and not the ruling class they currently are! Where we discuss fundamentals before voting and stop caring about Hindus and Muslims and caste and creed?

What can the next generation of entrepreneurs do to make our fundamentals and basics strong? And by fundamentals I mean absolute fundamentals. Like clean water, electricity, food supply network, medicine, hospitals and infrastructure (roads and trains) and education in every single village. I don’t care about the entrepreneurs who make dev tools to help enterprises collaborate better. Yes you serve a purpose, but you are serving the top 5-10% and your efforts would never uplift the laborers that are walking home 100s of Kms. We need our youth to unite and rebuild India. We have to get into drone deliveries, rapid road construction technologies, autonomous trucks, bio technology and what not! We won our independence more than 70 years ago, and have for too long relied on foreign countries to uplift us and our economy. It’s time we take action! If you are educated and can read and go to work for an MNC, you owe it to your future generations to invent after you get home.

I am at loss for ideas on how to start rebuilding my country. But I know we have to get up and start building! (Of course not now. Let this calm down, and start in 3 months. Stay the fuck home right now!)",_drimzy," Answer : Nothing will change. This too shall pass and we will be back to the same if great country the world envies. India numbah 1. /s One thing will change for sure. We will, as a nation, start prioritising healthcare for the first time in history. Elections ab healthcare ke muddon pe lade jaayenge. It depends on how long this lasts and how bad this is.

If this is over by June and/or with less than 10000 dead: nothing will change except our response to future epidemics.

If lakhs of people die and this doesn't end till 2021: things will change, people will take a harder look at the inept leaders, government will be forced to be more agile, how people will change, I cannot predict.

FYI: There are startups working on done deliveries and autonomous vehicles, but nobody's willing to invest in them because current government regulations prevent them from making a viable product which can be brought to market. Same with biotech: even after the huge investments required, there is no guarantee that a product is going to be allowed by the government. lavda kuch hoga Though your heart is at the right place, India is very far from having tech like autonomous trucks, or rapid road construction. Drone delivery still sounds promising in foreseeable future. But what India needs desperately is an educational reform. We need to educate people, and make sure people have a scientific temper. If we can somehow change the way people think, they’ll eventually choose a better govt. When a govt. “promotes” certain religious beliefs, that’s when you know how dirty this game is. If we can understand the target audience of this govt. and educate them, that might help achieving what you dream of. 

I see your ‘Non-political’ tag, but honestly you cannot change the fundamentals without tasting the “sweet” Indian Politics. Hindu-Muslim itself is a very controversial political topic. And as long people are uneducated, this will not change. People are staying in their homes for 21 days because they’re either scared of contracting/spreading it, or because the Modi told them too. For f***’s sake until a decade ago people didn’t even know that AIDS didn’t spread by touching. And now to answer your question, it’s not a simple yes or no. 

No, India cannot change immediately after this Covid-19. The roads will have traffic jams again. The air pollution level will increase back to being worse. You’ll have the noise pollution again. Rash driving, spitting, littering, etc. 
People who are complacent don’t want change. People who are corrupt, don’t want change. People who have power, don’t want change. As long as people like Sadhvi, Yoginath, etc. are there to influence the mob, don’t expect a big reform. You can bring in all the autonomous trucks you want you’ll find them burnt down amidst a Hindu-Muslim riot one day. You wanna clean your house? Kill the cockroaches too. 

Yes, India will change eventually. India will change because of the newer upcoming generations. And, India can change if we are able to successfully educate the people. If we can make them understand their right to education. And, if they cannot access the resources, then we take the resources to them. India will change when the people (or generation) currently ruling the country dies, and a new generation takes over. 

But it might be too late then, given the climate-change and all, but India isn’t even bothered about climate-change so it’s probably not real, eh? Get into politics and survive without dying.

Get into movies get rich and then get into politics.

I have been trying to get some minor water issues fixed at my place for more than a year now, and I know for sure how much of a hassle it is to deal with bureaucracy and the fear of goons.

Worst part is the goons are from the same neighborhood as I am and they don't understand that the fight is for them...  The only way to do this is to get into politics and be the change. India was in a forward path until Hindus and Muslims were calling themselves as Indians. When Indians were made to look at themselves as Hindus & Muslims and India as Ramrajya, things were started falling apart.

If we need to build a strong INDIA, we all should feel as Indians again, including north eastern Indians, and Kashmiris. Until then whatever you said is going to be a day dream. Nothing's going to change. You don't cleanse a millennias worth of bigotry and incompetence with a simple plague. This will instead bring out the worst in us, as the id takes over and animalistic survival and resource accumulation takes priority over social development. Even historically, any great plague is followed by a massive power vacuum, and rebuilding a society to be better than it was before becomes impossible. You can, at max, restore to a state before the collapse. Ha Ha Ha.......  :( Status quo maintained. Nope.

Because feudal and superstitious societies don't become more so during crises. Not less. nope. Yes, Please keep millions of UP-Bihar migratory workers back in their own state and give them employment there only...",2020-03-29 14:23:33
Politics,26-year-old arrested in Chennai for shouting slogans against Modi during BJP rally,798,f22qr1,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/26-year-old-arrested-chennai-shouting-slogans-against-modi-during-bjp-rally-117917?amp&__twitter_impression=true,75,,hipporama," >Kanaganathan allegedly shouted 'Down Down Modi' from the terrace of his building, while the BJP meeting was underway in a public place. See the bigger picture : 

They are arresting people who say anything against modi/bjp all over the places, even Facebook and Whatsapp messages have caused people to be arrested.People who protest get severely beaten, people who show dissent  could even loose their jobs.

This creates an environment where nobody is against BJP or even questioning BJP, even when they were killing people in PNB scam people were scared to say anything against modi/bjp. 

Combined with modia and huge propaganda everywhere they have created an **illusion of huge BJP support which is a complete lie** . People who hate RSS/BJP outnumbers Bhakts all over india, It's just they are too afraid to say anything and even if they say it they don't get any media exposure. Remember the kissan rally, that was HUGE and still all media were silent except few like NDTV. On the other hand anything that's pro-RSS/BJP is shown by media 24/7.

Without this illusion they have significantly low support, even among there core voters. > When TNM asked the Inspector of the Virugambakkam station exactly why he had been arrested, he said, ""There was a BJP gathering there and his slogans created tension.""

Can they please arrest Nirmala Sitharaman please?  Her budget speech created tension for me. Didnt expect this to happen in Chennai Down Down Modi *can* cause violence hence arrest. 

Goli maaro *actually* causes violence - no arrest. He was shouting from the terrace of his own house and was arrested for it.. Wtf.. is this normal? Fascist much? Fuck the police who arrested. Protesting is our right. Next time gather more people who support your opinions and raise the slogans. Can AIADMK please stop sucking Delhi's dick? https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/828586029238005760?s=20 Let's bring back the slogan 'Chowkidar chor hai' Oh AIADMK will fall like they've never seen before if they ally with the BJP. So... Free speech is dead? /s Well they cannot arrest all of Delhi now. (Unable to contain my laughter lol) If BJP assholes can talk about killing people openly and there were zero arrests then how does shouting **Down Down Feku** create public tension? Shameless police I give you the example of that woman shouting insults and nonsense at the Shikara screening. She spoke, she sat down, no security, nothing. 

Bolne ka haq sab ko hai, lekin bolne ke baad ki safety sab ke paas nahi hai. The likes of DMK should turn it into a Tamilian vs outsider issue. That's the only way to scare off BJP thugs in TN. Worth it i guess! Not only BJP, all parties doing the same thing with their protesters. If jayalalitha was alive none of this would have happened Let's fuck this country more by voting them again. Abbe yaar, what is this?

Why do these people not let citizens stand up? I for one despise this. People scream against other parties but I don't see them in jail. 

Thanks to the OP for bringing this up. I'm sure I won't see this in TOI tomorrow. India has Freedom of Speech^TM with Reasonable Restrictions^TH that clearly apply to you and I but not those with money and/or power. We also don't have access to pliant laws, that's only for the rich and/or powerful.

India is the world's biggest democracy^TM It's because of us he got arrested. BJP arrests weak single people. If millions shouted down down Modi, that man would've been saved. I just went there and the sheer amount of bjp rallies just makes me puke. Bs Azaadi toh mangi thi... I'd say we all deserve this. Remember, how we were trolling MMS being a puppet of Sonia and here we are, someone getting arrested for raising their voice against Modi. Geniuses pretending that this happens only to opponents of BJP.

India has never had robust freedom of expression protections. Take a look at where India is on Press Freedom Index:

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press\_Freedom\_Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index) So far nobody knows what exactly the slogan was. It _allegedly_ was down down modi. So keep your Anti-Modi propaganda to your own stupid selves, please and thank you.",2020-02-11 12:00:07
Politics,"BJP openly calling Rana Ayyub a ""Jihadi"" & declaring India is ""Hindutva Bharat""",1531,f1vmi7,https://i.redd.it/z2b5exitf5g41.png,230,,informationtiger," Where do Indians even get their muslim = jihadi narrative from? India has 200M muslims and yet virtually all our terror attacks are from our neighbor to the west. Indian muslims have been characterized by their refusal to get radicalized why is that handle so vile? BJP Karnataka handle is particularly more vile than any other BJP handle. I wonder why. I reported this tweet. Looks like twitter has taken it down for now. I am pretty sure this handle meets all terms of service of Twitter. Say whatever you want but just add ""Bharat Mata ki"" at the end.  BJP Karnataka social media is being handled by a particularly vicious troll. I don’t remember the other BJP handles being as horrible as theirs Yeh kahaan dark hai, yeh toh musalmano ke liye zindagi hai.

On a serious note, I want to use this post to promote Rana Ayyub’s book - The Gujarat Files. Please read it if you haven’t already! Some edgy teenager runs this account. Probably the most stupid official Twitter account I've come across All animals are equal but some are more equal than others. BJP Karnataka can fuck off... Rana Ayyub wrote a book exposing Modi’s corruption in Gujarat, didn’t she? If so, it was only a matter of time before those anti-Muslim सालों went after her. The time is not so far when the whole world see hindutva as a new terror brand.... Wtf bjp is doing ... Brought to you by Bharatiya Jumla Party, the party which twists things wildly to declare them ‘anti-hindu’ This response is infuriating, yeah, but it's also so fucking stupid. It's like the dumbfuck running this handle is deliberately misunderstanding Rana Ayyub's response. I've never seen so many contradictions in one tweet. Saying Bharat is ""Hindutva"" implies that anyone who isn't Hindutva is a second class citizen. If PM Modi and whoever the hell is running this account regarded Muslims as Indian then they wouldn't need to call an Indian journalist a jihadi based on her last name. I mean even the ""your"" and ""our world"" shows that you don't regard Muslims as Indians. Kiss ko chutiya bana raha hai? Atleast they conceded that jihadi and hindutva is pretty much parallel 😆 The tweet's disgusting  of course but I want to know which pathetic soul decides the content calender for the handle. I would very much like to pour some ice cold water on them or some fart spray The more they shout ""Hindu hindu,"" the worse their administration, usually.

BJP's ground rules for all things is to shout hindu hindu. Especially if they get caught not being able to manage things. The 'Balls Scale':

Rana Ayyub > ALL of India's liberals put together 


Also, India is a Nazi state now.. Deal with it and fight against the enemy with what you got or just shut up and pray for the right people to win. 

BUT, don't be in the fucking la-la land of denial about facts. I have rarely ever scene a post this self contradictory How come most of the toxic bjp tweets come from BJP Karnataka Hindutva: the next ISIS Congratulations to most people in this comment section for receiving the Oscar's for Best Picture made on you guys. Glory to india..
Jai Shri ram Just waiting and watching India being sunk down by the hands of Modi Whoever runs that BJP handle needs therapy. Their definition of Hindutva and yours are different it seems

And Rana Ayyub is clearly a pro-jihadi by her own deeds/statements *Hindutva Bharat*.  
*Muslims* It's BJP itself which is a religious terrorist organization. just shows how desperate bjp/modi have become. Jai Shaheen Bagh. Muslims are indians in hindutva bharat, how can you just contradict yourself in 2 consecutive lines. Lol your world and our bharat... What irks me is the plain audacity! Absolutely stunning! bjp say bharat mata ki jay in the end every one, modi modi modi... He also said that the thing about Muslims but y'all are not ready for that conversation Technically pappu has never won. We are just assuming stuff, which is fair ... But his team is better than BJP's and off course they did make a lot of companies etc... Fuck it, mask off. >Muslims may be second class Citizens for you, but for PM Modi they are [puppies run under a wheel](https://in.reuters.com/article/narendra-modi-puppy-reuters-interview-idINDEE96B08S20130712). 

FTFY Could someone tell me what's wrong with Hindutva? Factual answers prefered over opinions this tweet got deleted I mean, it just read “our Hindutva Bharat” and then “Muslims may be a second class citizens for you, but for PM Mudi they’re Indians. ”?  
*hypocrisy ki bhi... seema hoti hai* When people won't have documents at the time of submission due to any of the reasons then bjp would say...""dekho hmne pehle hi bata diya tha documents safe rakhne ko...Ab hm kuchh nhi kr skte"" Original link to the tweet please. Why are screenshots being uploaded when we know they can easily be doctored? BJP Dakshin Uttar Pradesh is the one of the more honest voices of Bhagwa Jihaad Party. Welcome to New India, the 21st century repeat of Nazi Germany! Wow...mansplaining AND  communal in the same sentence. How is it a direct threat to Muslims ? The last part of the tweet says otherwise.

Well you just need to look at the policies created under this government. They’ve been totally apathetic to the general public. Not a single point in the original election manifesto was brought to fruition. And the second manifesto was nothing short of horrifying.

The economy is at an all time low.
Sense of community that used to exist previously has been shattered for the most part.
Financial disruption aka demonetization and shoddy implementation of gst has wreaked havoc.
Anyone who has an opinion against the government policies are branded traitors and are even murdered - Kalburgi, Gauri Lankesh.
Poor relationships with all weather friends such as Sri Lanka, Nepal, Iran and Russia.
People’s mandates are completely disregarded and state governments are toppled via horse trading.
The number of loan defaulters today is at an all time high.
Parliament sessions have been reduced to a circus and critical bills are passed without consultations.
Judiciary, election commission, intelligence and media has been infiltrated and disintegrated.

Just take a look at the general atmosphere of uncertainty looming in the country. The present cabinet is totally clueless and is led by an even more clueless chap who thinks yoga videos and selfies will take India forward. Unfortunately it’s a cycle on the Great Plains of time and we have to hold on till they leave. that expectation lol I'm neutral, I just want to hear from both sides ;) He will be the next Jaitley for BJP - fluent in English, make BJP ‘cool’ in the eyes of the urban youth because of the way he presents himself and also defend the lesser defendable aspects of BJP’s politics (every party has lesser defendable aspects) in a very suave manner.

Lets hear it from both sides. Lets give a voice to the fascist. Actually in the video, kunal used the clips so as to show the hypocrisy in Tejaswi's statement ...

 And just to make it clear, it's not the first time that he edited he videos (like this), he always does the same and hence, tejaswi must have known about the same too i believe I left video when Kamra said I have no credibilty ""I just want to hear from both sides"" and ""so I don't want to hear from those guys who just thought ""wow ahaha tejasvi got roasted lol he's not fit to be MP"", no your opinions don't matter.""

Good click bait bro! 😬 😛 Right of Center here. You can also call me closet Modi fan since I get downvoted a lot here. Doesn't matter you are left or right of center you are bound to be downvoted by both the right and left in most of your opinions on the internet.

I watched the video this morning (before this thread was live) and my observation is that Tejasvi should not have gone for this interview with such low preparation. Throwing random name-calling and jibes at Kamra looked so silly. He looked quite nervous and stupid in some parts although credit must be given to Kamra and the post production team for those hilarious peeinghuman clips. That made him look even dumber than I believe he is. Being a MP at 28 while not being a political scion is really tough in India. Anyhow I enjoyed the video like I enjoy most of Kamra's jokes however, I must add I was pretty pissed on Kamra for that photo he posted insulting the frontline workers on the day before Janta Curfew.

Coming back to Tejasvi, he is a decent guy but one is bound to get defamed while trying to defend the undefendable. Some of his colleagues both in the Parliament and the party offices are absolute piece of shit, they are like those stale fish that make the whole pond dirty. And sadly that is the situation of Right Wing politics in India, there is no credible right wing party which is why the BJP with all its flaws get elected again and again.

Recently, I was in my family Whatsapp group, which said something about how awesome the 9 AM 9 minute announcement thing is because of astrology and shit. I replied in the group with a funny Arnab gif and everyone dismissed it. To make things worse, another unkill sent another video about some doctor explaining scientifically how this astrologically thought out move will help drive away the coronavirus in our country. If you ask me, by believing in messages like these instead of our Medical and Security personnel, who are putting their bodies on the line to fight COVID-19 for us, is utterly disrespectful and stupid. Plain idiotic. Because of all this, my anxiety levels increase and I feel pathetic to be a part of such people who believe in this bull crap of 9 AM, 9 times = mangal and all this shit.   
How do you guys deal with this seriously? I mean it hurts me a lot and I get really sad at times. How do I cope with this?",naigonlassun," I never talk politics with my bhakt relatives and friends. Talk about anything other than politics and current affairs with them and your mind will be in peace, that is if you value the relationship. I have gradually cut the hardcore bhakts from my life because they contribute absolutely nothing to my life. Play Hamlet. When they talk Corona, post regarding badminton. When NAMO, post about otters mating. Do your own thang. 😈 Many like you.
Just mute that group and ignore them. You cannot argue with people who do not value facts. That's it. Just learn to avoid them. Mock the idiots. You have to engage them in a conversation.

For this, first you have to educate yourself about the modern scientific and rational tradition. This goes beyond merely mugging up scientific facts! Also, understand our own native philosophical traditions. You should read up on the history and philosophy of modern science, and also on our own classical modes of looking at reality. Why or why not are these two incompatible? Where is the actual difficulty here?

You must also learn the basics of presenting our arguments clearly and rationally. This works best when we approach people not with a snobbish attitude, but with a genuine desire to understand why they believe the things they do. Once we understand clearly how they justify their beliefs, we can better attack their positions.

Finally, note that we ourselves could be wrong. ""Reality is not only stranger than what we suppose, but it is stranger than what we can suppose"". Who knows, maybe astrology etc. will turn out to have some substance in ways that we cannot today foresee. So a bit of intellectual humility helps. Join them, blast them with stupid facts make them realise how stupid they all really are I think this is a phase we are going through as a result of poor democratic decisions. India, in hindsight will realize this maybe 10-20 years later. You or me cannot change these people. They will be like this until they die. What we can do is to try to raise a generation who are sensible enough. Better times will come. By getting depressed, keeping myself occupied with whatever I can, losing it occasionally, make myself and others miserable. Rinse, repeat. There is absolutely nothing to be done. You and I are trained to use logic as a tool to discern truth from untruth. They aren't. That's why no amount of logic will make sense to them.

It's because they speak a different language than us. To them, it's all about emotion. Not logic. All that 9 times 9 mangal bullshit, is what they've been trained since childhood to recognise.

The only way to get through to them is through the emotional shock of people they care about dying around them. Till then, nothing will get through. Increasingly, your family is not your family


It's whatsapp influenced- you cant be there all the time, while the phone can. 

India is very family focused, but I expect people will be switching allegiances to their echo chambers over family. ignorance is bliss, trust me. Tbh these are the people I respect generally apart from their political opinions.  So I just ignore them.

With the heat and shear will of people United together the virus will struggle to exists. Jai Hind. Jai Maharashtra Nahi. I've actually low-key severed ties with a few of them. And I have these bursts where I rant about how their thinking is damaging the country. And say things like how by not voting for the bjp I will die with a sound conscience. There is a silence that persists. This is all in person tho. Nothing on whatsapp, I've quit those groups. Thankfully my mother doesn't think like a lot of them. share videos of the work being done in hospitals around the world. pick countries that are a couple weeks ahead of what is happening in india. you can pic my country, usa. we have hospitals that are short on resources and the honest videos that the doctors and nurses are filming will put a little reality into anyone who views them. 

i recommend this video but there are many others from other countries too.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE68xVXf8Kw&t=10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE68xVXf8Kw&t=10s)  

no need to mock or tease your friends and family. just search for other countries news and videos and share this.

Politics,Need advice for work politics,8,fbpugf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fbpugf/need_advice_for_work_politics/,0,"Keeping it as short as I can. Please bear with me. 

I worked in a company for three years while I was approached by the current one. They persuaded me a lot to join and casually agreed to work on my terms. Lately, I was pushed into leading the domain I didnt sign up for. I was hired as the head of business development in terms of building relations. However, I have been pushed into being sales head. Given this shift and constant salary delays, I have been meaning to quit but decided to give it a couple more months 

But what followed recently was a shocker when my HR out of nowhere calls and tells me that they dont want me to continue. I was extremely furious with management as they directly persuaded me but chose to tell me through HR without even intimating about any issue. 

Upon further discussion with my COO, it turns out that it wasn't my performance or work, which they thankfully are very content with. It was coworkers saying shit about me that led him to assume and believe that I am degrading the office culture which was a shocker to me. 


Few points on the topic - 

1. My colleagues came to me with a work problem in hysterical and stressed states. 

For ex, I feel underpaid and stuff. To which I gave the suggestion to compile the work and highlight your skills and then have a one on one meeting with hr and management to justify the raise. 

This was portrayed to my management as me trying to demotivate people and pushing them to ask for raise. 


2. My CEO asked my HR to validate. She never spoke to me and gave me the reason as performance based issues for firing. Further told my CEO that she has validated the same with everyone else in the company and based on this he decided to let me go. 


3. I am the last person to gossip and been very out front in terms of my opinions. 



Have a discussion with my CEO tomorrow. Can anyone shed some light on how to deal with this. He doesn't want me to leave in terms of work but doesn't want a ""negative source"" in his team. 


I just don't want my image to be bad in a work place. I don't wish to continue in the company anyway but may want to extend my stay to a couple more months.",sufiyana7313,,2020-03-01 13:56:44
Politics,Can technology somehow change politics and remove corruption?,8,ezqzgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ezqzgm/can_technology_somehow_change_politics_and_remove/,4,"Hi everyone, I am new to politics, so please pardon me if my understanding of it is not correct.

The way the current system works just seems wrong to me with all the campaigning over issues and partisanship to just win votes. No way to quantify the work done and it's impact. I think that with present technology it would be easier to just ask what problems people are facing, analyze the data, refine it to come to some good solutions. Also, I feel that it should be easier to track what the government has done, allowing people to make decisions based on actual data.

I would like to know your thoughts about it?",letschange99," NO

Let me tell you with an example

We wanted to change an electricity connection from Commercial to Normal house hold connection. My Mom goes to electricity office for our area; the guy inside office a clerk asks INR 7500 and my mom calls me. I was flabbergasted — I was like what the hell and asked my mum to return. Next day, I took my mom with me and asked for the Area Engineer(AE). Spoke with him and he asked us to fill a request form and he took us with him and saw the property and we came back to his office.

After returning to his office... He asked INR 500 or something as a change fee. He told it's simple and he logged into his web portal and simple changed the radio button from commercial to household; he said it will be changed from next billing cycle.

My mom who was astonished; she told the AE the guy sitting outside your cabin asked for INR 7500 yesterday. He just called the guy and blasted him like anything... ""Because of people like you.. no one respects govt. servants like us.""

So... even if technology changes — people needs to change, the culture needs to change and the freaking mindset needs to change. > No way to quantify the work done and it's impact.

There clearly is a way to quantify work but we don't use it for our political decisions. I strongly believe technology can make positive impact if it is used wisely. Our current political instability is build on the basis of corruption and propaganda. In my view, unemployment is one the root causes of these issues. If we analyse the data with little compassion, we can find the root causes and treat them for the betterment of humanity. Corruption, radicalism are symptoms of an uncivil society. Treat the root causes can solve a lot of issues.",2020-02-06 19:20:53

He was a screen-hero, not a real one. TN had a habit of choosing their CMs from Cine Industry, hence Rajinikanth was thought of becoming CM in TN with the help of Modi. 

All those Dravidian heroes were able to understand the pulse of the people because they were in politics while acting, whereas Rajinikanth was a professional actor and had no political background and no interest in people as well. 

Suddenly he was thrust into Politics, hence he was making all non-sense statements and exposing himself which is very ugly inner self. Great. I like it. this guy is the most mislead of the bunch..

After Airport released CCTV footage, that guy said ""I thought they were doing eye check up"" 🤣 Kanika Kapoor confirms This is why Twitter is such a cesspool. There are plenty of people like Abhimanyu spreading all sorts of nonsense just to appear as ""woke"" individual. I can understand how thought there was no screening.  When proved wrong, just apologize and move on - cannot understand how he says he thought it was an ""eye test"" ! 

World's first and only airport offering eye scans. These guys should be fined he could have cross checked with some authority first instead of whinning on twitter. He didn't even a question but made a statement on lax testing at Ahmedabad airport. Thank god we have cctv otherwise half of the folks would have blindly believed what he said This is our well educated and well traveled. I feel bad for my poor country men who are being let down by such assholes. People are going to die for someone’s social media points. Shameful. 
I am sure he must be finding the clapping also “cringey AF”. He must have assumed they were welcoming him home with a ""Tilak"" These kind of people are even more harmful than kanika kapoor. They want to create distrust in people's mind just for their political agenda and a few SM followers He should be in jail. Atleast for a day. In the video the guy measuring temperature hardly looks at the reading. It seems like he is letting everyone pass. That’s a bit weird. The temperature screeching is really pointless. On top of that the airport authorities don't even explain home quarantining properly. To be fair to him they probably only check for symptoms and let them in.  That is useless.",2020-03-22 19:58:42

Truth to be told, they being on that position had no connection with them being born in India. 

If you look at the stats, 17% of total world population is in India. Which basically means that every 6th person is actually Indian. If India really needs to compete on global level, first we need to achieve this number. Every 6th Medal in Olympics should go to an Indian, every 6th Nobel prize should go to Indian, every 6th billionaire should be Indian, every 6th successful start-up should be from India. 
But in practical world, we are not even close to this number. We are, in fact getting worse every day. 

Sometime ago, Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, was criticized heavily when he said ""Indians are not creative""; I really understand why he said so now. We have almost same population as China, but their economy is 5 times greater than ours. Chinese have big markets of their own, they have grown their own technology, a new environment all together.
Our population is estimated to grow to 170 crores by 2050; in no way we have enough resources to sustain such a huge amount of people. With more and more automation coming every day, most of the already existing jobs are just on the brick of going extinct. 

In India not only do we have crises in allocation of funds; but the corruption at grass root level is disturbing.  
In the last three decades, India’s economy has grown, but most of this growth can be attributed to significantly improved access to the western world and its technology through the new medium of internet and cheap telephony. The low-hanging fruit from this have been plucked and India is starting to show signs of stagnation. 

Unless and until there is a major change in the critical thinking of the people in power, the future of this youth driven country looks very dim.",aradhya23," The state of our country is deeply worrying. There is crisis on every major fronts: the economy is tumbling; the environment and resources--particularly water--depleted and over-exploited; the politics unstable and problematic, and therefore not conducive for foreign investment while we're not able to generate enough jobs domestically.

I think those who are proud of people of Indian origins heading big corporations are snobs who are deeply insecure with their life and have nothing personal to boast about and so they take solace and pride in the achievements of people who have even a slight connection with them. It's repugnant. Raghuram Rajan giving similar reply to question to a student.

https://youtu.be/qUmWKVT7P4o Bas thodi der aur Hindu-Muslim Karne do phir soochenge desh ka kuch..... Jugaad is not innovation. Our 'chalta hai' attitude, unprofessionalism, lack of discipline, unpunctuality, lack of attention to details, dodging rules and the overall attitude are a big deterrent.

In last 70 years we haven't been able to produce a single truly multi national company at the level of Intel, MacDonald's, Samsung, Honda, Ikea, Coca Cola, etc. Let that sink in - not One big multinational company in 70 years. Yup, and this is perhaps one of the biggest reasons why educated people want to immigrate to other countries: India's future was already bleak, and with the emergence of a central government that can't effectively govern, it's looking to get even worse.

Our educational institutions: overburdened
Our natural resources: overburdened
Our global influence: reducing by the day
Our politicians: too busy leeching off of us
Our innovations the last couple of decades: effectively zero
Our chances of improving our state of affairs: effectively zero

Make no mistake, India is full of talent and hard workers. Hell, half of Silicon Valley is Indian. But in the grand scheme of things, all we do is look for better opportunities and take the first ticket out. India's machinery has deep, systemic problems that need urgent resolution, but the people who have the power to take on such challenges don't care about them, and those that actually want to lack the pull to actually make something happen. 

I am really scared for the future of India, and if you are of a sound and healthy mind then so should you. Also the weirdest. Indian American kids winning spelling bees in the US being celebrated in India. Like what the actual fuck? These are American citizens who have relatives in India. Not kids who know any of the struggles of being a child in India. Indians have such an inflated sense of ego and quickly attribute any achievement of any person across the globe if they are even 1% Indian to our “heritage” . Creativity in India is not nurtured .. I'll give you my example, I was working in Swiggy. It's a unicorn company. On paper it was a dream job as my job was to over look photography of multiple cities in Uttar Pradesh. A creative job, in a unicorn company. I mean what could one ask for .. 

I left the job after 6 months because being from arts bg really isn't really acknowledged in an environment where sales is the prime motive. At thr end of the day, a guy who's done MBA, and is the boss, had the final say in what looks good and what isn't. And he had absolutely zero sense with regards to the photographic asthetics. . I wanted to revamp rhe whole presentation thing and the guy in-charge didn't see the big picture. This is why there are no games made in India like they do in Japan .. this is why we don't have a Hideo Kojima or legendary Hideaki Itsuno .. 

Thr tax on consoles is so high .. the normal middle class can't afford it .. how will there be demands or uprise in the Sales of games if ppl won't be able to afford consoles .. Pubg was a huge success because it was on mobile platform. Imagine same ppl having consoles .. I'm using this analogy to show what's wrong with our way of seeing things .. 

This is the problem with Indian business ecosystem. The work force is cente of attention .. it's all about quantity and not the quality .. The CEOs of global companies with Indian origins are celebrated because of stereotypes they broke. Indians were always seen as hardworking and humble followers but not as leaders in the western world. 

Sure they got education and network from top schools in the U.S. to reach current heights, but they still did and this means others can do that too. That is something people want to say when they say many CEOs are Indians. 

Next wave will be for home grown CEOs breaking the stereotype that you need to go to Harvard for it. Looking up at global expansion of OLA and OYO. I think as soon as they give up their Indian passports they cease to be Indians for me. 

You love Indian culture so much, hold onto that passport as a symbol of your pride. 

Amartya Sen has an Indian passport, Raghuram Rajan has Indian passport, Akshay Kumar doesn’t. So who is the real Indian? >Truth to be told, they being on that position had no connection with them being born in India. 

That's an extreme statement to make. Everyone is influenced by the society around them and the cultural values that are forced on them. Obviously, these differ a lot within India since we are a big country and there is no monolith Indian culture.

Also, the notion of national identity is very muddy in these days. People heavily influenced by external media may be more connected to outside world than their home country. On the other hand, people bullied for their identity may feel more connected to their ancestral place than the country of residence.

Things like mixed heritage, permanent residency, dual passports and things like European identity make is even more difficult to judge someone's national identity. Don't get me wrong here but the problem lies with us. As a whole, we lack empathy, we lack humility, we are gullible, we discriminate, we don't accept diverse point of views. We voted in a megalomaniac who's only USP was hindu-muslim riots. Our entire social fabric has to change, your politicians, bureaucrats all are products of our society which is struggling with communalism or as I like to call it: groupism.


There is class struggle in every place and everybody is subconsciously aware of it. We only care about whether we are getting what we want, and have no fucks to give if our neighbor sleeps hungry.

All these years of poverty and silent desperation has killed our conscience, we have gotten better of it, we live in survival mode. 

And I'm not saying that the other parts of the world don't have these problems, they surely have, but they also have enough resources to deal with them.  Not you, not us. Our only hope is our conscience and our ability of being empathic.

And it would take a lot of work, lot of public discourse, and lot of unyielding effort for our social fabric to change for better. The problem is the majority of indians dont have the mindset for innovation > Brick of going extinct

Sorry if I come across as an ass, but I believe the word is ‘brink’. If it was a typo, then my bad.  ""Sometime ago, Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, was criticized heavily when he said ""**Indians are not creative**""; I really understand why he said so now. We have almost same population as **China**, but their **economy is 5 times greater than ours**. ""

I get where you are coming from but China did not get where they are by being creative, in fact it got there by being exactly opposite. They got there by copying. I am not saying this to belittle what China did is ""bad"" or ""inferior"".  It is just that they are lot more focused and ruthless in their approach, and they don't have to care much for local optics to ensure that the path they have taken is ""pure"" to achieve goals.

With India being a democracy, pleasing every group is next to impossible. Look no further than CAA.

Our country lacking good trade schools with mainly unskilled labor has had a big role off late in economy/manufacturing not being competitive. Fun Fact:  
SONIA GANDHI IS AN INDIAN. Gold At least we didn't give any worst viruses to the world. No outbreaks, no attacks on any other country (Except the most recent, you know, URI)
We are trying hard and one we will help the humanity persist. 
It's about being an Indian it's all about being an Human. Stop doing this bull shitting around and do your job to help the humanity and the all the life forms around us. 
Respect everything which is living. The problem is the majority of indians dont have the mindset for innovation Deep down, we know we are in big trouble. That's why we cling to the past and makeup accomplishments. We are desperate to be proud of something. I see this a lot in people who question our government.  Why do you compare it with China? It's not similar to us in anyway- population density land resources,  political and cultural atmosphere.  

Surely there are better countries out there that we could compare ourselves to like Japan or South East Asian ones. but they say ""(young) population dividend""..... That's true coz Indians lack ummah mentality and embrace & integrate with the country they live in Google and Apple are both evil. I think its juvenile to think in terms of those numbers (every 6th Indian should be x). we were royally screwed by the Britishers and we have come a long way since independence. at the same time we have a long way to go in terms of social development indicators and the nature of employment. your post is just a rant. Never understood what achievement in sport has anything to do with success or betterment of a country? It's just a form of viewing entertainment and that's okay in and of itself. 

Winning 200 Olympic medals will achieve you nothing. >Every 6th medal in olympics should go to indians

Bitch please. There's a small land size of africa between ethiopia and kenya which produces all good distance runners. Either we need to juice up our athletes to gills or we are never winning them. Nitpicking but pretty sure Pichai still holds Indian passport. I tend to disagree with this. I think there IS pride in the fact that Indians are so damn successful abroad. I've been in the US for 7 years now but I grew up in India. My values and my culture are what I gained while growing up in India. I am going to return to India this year because I know I can contribute more there than I can contribute here. But that does not mean that my friends who chose to stay here permanently are any less Indian. Me and my Indian friends were always top of the class in college because the Indian curriculum and hard working culture is something that we benefited from.

By no means is the Indian education great, but there is some aspect of it that makes Indians go all around the world and succeed in academics and stay well above average. I am not really getting what you all guys are saying , although i do understand that india has little contribution to someone if they became ceos of certain companies but then SOME DID IN FACT PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION IN INDIA , PICHAI (iit kharagpur) NADELA(MIT NAGPUR) , so blatantly denying this fact is just mere assumption of a stereotypic approach towards this whol indian ceo drama. As the saying goes CHILD IS THE FATHER OF MAN ,so indian upbringing has affected these people. Yeah they are not, the same way most of the users of r/INDIA aren't INDIANS. CEO's like Sundar Pichai proudly accept being an Indian .Go watch their interviews before speaking.

Can be politics or just daily life.   
SHOOT 'em :)",dontaskmek," -murder of both Homi Bhabha and Lal Bahadur Shastri had CIA involvement because of India's nuclear program


-US had an active role in India's defeat in Sino-India war most proably due to NMA movement and Indian Army's role in liberation of Goa.

-The story of Netaji's survival is played just to score political points, there is no way Bose wouldnt have returned to India after the independence.

-Sardar Patel didn't do all he could to protect Mahatama Gandhi That my school and every other school in India are made on kabristan land. Hindu khatre mein hai. [deleted] Anyone remembers that one regarding to Ashoka? Something like desi-Illuminati society of  9 enlightened folks with secrets of the world.

In politics a famous conspiracy is that Sasikala killed Jayalalitha. That it's democracy My list :

* Bjp has been stealing money from indian banks via corporations who borrow huge loans and a percentage of the money is used to buy Electoral Bonds. Loans turn into NPA, modi government makes SBI (our money) bail out the banks. 

* BJP ran demonetization to remove black money from pockets of other political parties, after successfully laundering their own hoards of black money. Via amit shah's coop bank in Gujarat for example. 

* Bjp runs a lot of the Rs. 2000 fake note racket from Gujarat

* Bjp has big time shit on all opposition parties, which they threatened to make public if they oppose too much.

* Congress doesn't have balls.

* Bjp is actively promoting discord between communities to mask their utter failure at governing the country sincerely. 

* Bjp is the same as congress corruption wise, but unlike congress they cover all their anti-national activities with HUGE propaganda over social and news media. Gangadhar hi Shaktimaan hai. Modiji's chest size is 56 inches You disappear when you take morning walks That subash chandra bose didn't die in plane crash and lived secretly in mountains or something. Taj Mahal is actually Tejo mahalaya India's defensive capabilities are purposely projected as lower than what they are or something. 

Amit Shah is the real prime minister. 

Mr.Baby will be the real prime minister in 2024. The involvement of CIA to bring down the first communist govt. of kerala.Its a very well known conspiracy theory,that congress and CIA joined hand to bring down the govt.I heard somewhere that CIA accepted that it was involved in this,but i am not completely sure about it's authenticity.",2020-03-14 02:55:31

# 🏆 I always say this and will repeat again:

They are not cops. Just some fustrated Indians in government suits. Idk why retards celebrating cops beating people unprofessionally. Some poor man had to get his groceries. In my town they have closed all the shops including groceries, vegetable shops despite the official notification saying that these would be open. Only the medical shops are open and even they are facing issues in getting their supplies once the stock is over since the police is not allowing vehicles to enter the district.

Today the DC's office said they will allow a window period from 12 PM to 2 PM to come out and buy supplies and when people came out during this period the police started chasing them out and thrashing them.

The State Government puts out an official statement, the DC disregards that statement and put out its own statement and then the police disregards both their statements and puts together it's own set of rules. Like WTF!!!! Yes,Cops are worst.They are abusing power like monsters. Just goons. Police are just goons. I went out to get groceries on my Bike, a cop stopeme asking where i was going i said im going to the supermarket to get milk and bread he asked me to park my bike aside. Took me to the store on his bike and dropped me back to where he stopped me, then i drove my bike home.

I don't have any problem with it , but why?? What did he possibly gain from this Same happened in my city Petrol pumps are to remain open and hospitals etc too. Two days ago, chutiya cops here were stopping cng/petrol pump workers/medical staff and saying ""dobara dikha to bike sieze kr doonga.""



No hazard pay, no security measures.


Thaali bajao, bhnchodon! Today only I saw a WhatsApp status showing a cop lathi charging two people, with laughing voices in background. How the fuck this is funny and acceptable? You don’t ask people the reason for being out and just go on physical assault? If they have broken the law confiscate the vehicle and fine them. Same situation everywhere, cops are beating the shit out of people who are roaming around. Cow vigilantes will turn into corona vigilantes.Very soon gonna have vigilante squads roaming the streets.

Just after today's speech, streets were again filled with public out on a stroll or getting groceries for the next 21 days.RIP social distancing.

grocery sttores have already run out of items due to hoarding.Whatever that has been left is being sold on inflated prices. are you near malviya nagar? Yaha to man chahe use pitne lagte hai. Sabji walo ke goods le jate hai. Lagta hai Gand pe danda pada hai faltu ka! are you too ante-natisonal? Fellow amdavadi here.. Where was this exactly? Hit them back man....at my place if policeman hits you without reason you hit them back or atleast confront them..!! They are not above the law. I am against supermarkets. Open air kirana stores are less contagious than supermarkets Bro if you know you're good enough, get yourself a govt job. A slight lower position than your qualification will also be good.

The people of India need to fill govt jobs with the best of em.

Politics,Amit Shah's Politics Has Always Thrived on Hindu-Muslim Divisions,147,ea07zd,https://thewire.in/politics/amit-shah-rajdeep-sardesai-extract-hindu-muslim-divisions,13,,sudden_dust," ""Shah smiled knowingly and replied: ‘Which side of Sarkhej is your house situated, ours or theirs?’ ""

Chilling Horsetrading, bullying, and communalism. 

""~~Saam,~~ daam, dand, bhed"". Hindu-Muslim division? It is more like Hindu desire to oppress Muslims in India, and hate Muslims in Pakistan. 

It is HATRED that theythrive upon. Is it not the fundamental convent of RSS? End of the day this swine is nothing but a bloody thug! > When I related this incident to a long-time political-watcher in Gujarat, he offered an explanation for Modi’s seeming defensiveness: ‘Please understand, Modi owes Shah a great deal. When Shah was in jail, the CBI tried to extract a confession out of him to somehow implicate Modi in the murder case in which he was charged. The agency even promised to let him off if he turned approver. Shah refused and from that day onwards, Modi remains obligated to Shah. Now, they are an unshakeable jodi, one soul in two bodies!’ Suppandi Shah is out of his depth in the home ministry though. You can't run a country by pretending its like running a gang of criminals. The current events show that he neither has the acumen nor the power to do so. Indian politics is fuelled by this political divide forever.

Why only Amit Shah? All the politicians do these. At the end of the day, politicians only care about staying in power and for this, these maggots can do anything.

At first that might be the case, but if you speak with humility they will wake up. My parents were BJP supporters, now they are not. We live in a society Mudizi at window 🤣 My dad got bluetooth headphones for Xmas, he roams around the house constantly listening to the news.

If you want to donate, donate to Chief Minister's relief Fund of your respective state. The fundamental question that needs to be asked is what was the need for this fund, when we already have the Prime Ministers Relief Fund that has been around for decades and has used money for various disasters in the country. Moreover, it already has substantial funds, and is ready to go.

Wouldn’t even in my inception level 6 I would believe that yogi has declared such schemes. ‘15 lakh’ 1000 thousand per day is 30000 per month. No one with an iota of common sense would believe it 

Still 1000 per month to every daily wager is an excellent initiative (If it is actually executed instead of being so e PR stuff that only exists on paper).

Rest of India needs to follow this as well. Our unorganised sector is absolutely getting decimated due to this crisis. All other state government are paying more plus providing shelter and free food.
Punjab Govt is spending 3-4 times of Yogi and also giving atleast 3k to all registered labourers and daily wage workers.

Me - Dude, Vir Das is doing an AMA on Reddit?
Him - Remind who that is again (not much of a fan) 
Me *thinks for a while* - The guy who scream isne Mera choosa hai in Delhi Belly. 

So my question is. Do people scream that like at you when they spot you in public Why does your name is spoken fast sounds Weird ass?
And were you ever heckled for that.. What's your writing routine like? How do you keep going on days when you have no ideas to write about? Hi, love your work. Your take on stand up is so fresh. It sort of feels like having a long chat with a friend. Q: What do you like and dislike about the stand up comedy scene in India? We're still on for the SF show later this Feb right? Hey Vir!

Saw in some commemorative speech of yours that you waited tables while doing your degree in US.

How was that experience?

Would you rather have done something else while doing your degree ? How was Conan O'Brien? Hey man, I opened for you at Monash University when you came out. Any plans to come back? First of all, thanks so much for your videos on board exams. They helped me (any many others like me) a lot in dealing with stress!

Now moving on to my questions),

1. Why don't you make more videos on Board Exams every year ?
2. Which Indian Comedy Special that you saw recently (can be on Prime Video or Netflix or any other platform) made you laugh a lot ?
3. I think with the rise of so many streaming platforms and such a diverse range of well made Indian content on them, I think it is the right time to make a Delhi Belly sequel with a streaming-only release! What do you think? Alright folks. Thats all for me. Never done one of these before, it was so much fun. If you get a chance do watch 'Vir Das for India' on Netflix. It's now streaming. I'm also going to be announcing a huge tour today so head to my social at noon. If you're in the states or anywhere outside India head to www.virdas.in for america, UK, africa tour dates and more. On a serious note....i know how many content options you've got. If you're spending time watching my stuff...it's an honour to make you laugh. Thanks guys :-) How do you think it is best to improve india on individual level? You me together how can we improve india ? Loved all of your specials man! Power to you Major difference between crowds in India and NRI crowd? Seeing majority of NRI crowd are pro Modi, do you witness some backlash from them while performing abroad? Nothing to say, haven’t seen your special yet, will soon, but saw the clip of the chawanprash joke. Agree 100%. Tell us about your worst heckling experience. If given a chance to go back in time to your childhood anything you would want to do/eat/or any person you would want spend more time with . Thanks for the awesome SITDOWN..👍 What is between u and Kunal Kamra?

Was it a friendly banter? Do you dunk Parle G in cold milk or cold milk?

When you dunk, do you leave it in the milk for it become soggy or do you take it out immediately so that it retains its crunch? Aren't you Luv from Go Goa Gone…? Which city has the most difficult crowd to please? 

Also, which city has the most hecklers? Hey Vir, just a few questions for you:

\- Do you write down your jokes on paper or use a computer or something?

\- where do you go for inspiration?

\- what do you do to stay relevent after all these years?

\- Do you think Jerry Seinfeld is funny?

\- What topics are off limits for your jokes?

You are awesome, thank you !! Hey Vir, absolutely love your shows, your on-stage confidence is inspring & your comedy is hilarious! 

Do you have a pre-show routine? If yes what is it? 
Also, what is the hardest aspect of writing comedy/doing shows for you? Hey, thanks for doing this. I've got a couple of questions.
1. Are you working on any Delhi Belly/Go Goa Gone type of projects? Loved you in both of those.
2. Any chance of a potcast revival? Miss the lully lamp. 
3. How involved are you in the Indian stand up scene since you went international?
4. Your thoughts on the fall of AIB (especially after the allegations against utsav were disproved) and how it's affected the stand up scene here.
5. If I may, what is/was your beef with Kamra? 
Thanks.

PS: Vir Das for India was a pretty bold move. Congrats on the success. Do you have imposter syndrome? How do you overcome the fear of judgement? Your views on psychedelics - Mushrooms, weed et al ? Where do you buy your fresh produce veggies etc. from? Who buys them for you? Your favourite Bollywood and Hollywood movie? Do you lurk on lnrdt ? Has Marvel approached you for any roles? Hi Vir, I saw the special and I thought it was awesome! My questions for you: 

1. Looking back, what's an investment that you've made (money, time, relationship, biscuits) that you're most proud of/grateful for?
2. What is some bad advice you see given to young people in India these days that they should ignore ?
3. Can we have the potcast back please? That was awesome!!

Cheers! Will The Loved Special coming to a platform anytime soon? Saw it live in Bombay and loved it. Was hoping to for it to come to Netflix as well. Any plans to bring back the potcast? Can we expect a Hasan Minhaj - Vir Das collab anytime soon?  
Want that full on Desi firepower unleashed!🤩 [deleted]  One thing is clear that Vir Das is having an affair with Jetlags. Greenwich mean time got some good loving on his world tour. VirDas is scared when he's in the US because he has to manage romancing four time zones and prays that they don't find about his affairs with other time zones.
On a serious note, how do you handle Jetlags? Did you perform at the comedy store? If yes then who did you get to hang out with? Aachar kaun sa khate ho? Gharwala ya bazaar wala? How does this generation’s sense of humor compare to previous generations? Do you think we are any better because we had no choice but not to take ourselves too seriously? Hey, thanks for doing this!

What is your guilty pleasure Bollywood movie? Is India and its political system in desperate need of a major reform? Considering the current situation in the country, do you think fear will ever stop you from taking a political stance?  


Love your work, by the way! What made you realise a career in comedy was your future? How did you have that inner feeling that your brand of comedy would be successful? Met u once at Changi airport. I regret till this date not.taking a pic with u Are you paid by Parle for promoting ParleG? Hi Vir. Loved your stand up special For India! So my question for you is since you started doing comedy 14-15 years back how you think that the comedy scene in India has changed? Do you consider yourself as one of the pioneers of the Indian stand up scene? And does political satire like numerous American late night shows have any scope in India? I'm a gay Indian. And I honestly think you're super hot. What's your views on gay rights in India and across the world? Indian is a nationality, not a race. How do you plan on making sure that distinction is clear in your work? Tushar kapoor or Sunny Leone, who's the better actor? Have you ever tried dark commedy how do you deal with twitter trolls? Do you plan on coming back to Lucknow for a gig? Tips to get over a Writer's Block/ Creative Block? Go Goa Gone sequel happening noh? What’s your take on the “too much wokeness” argument that is going on...  Obama also spoke about it!! I saw an episode of yours a long time back where you were talking about the time you were drunk and spent a night with some other girl and your girlfriend got to know about it months after
Well to be honest, it wasnt funnt at all. It was disrespecting to a great extent. Whatever happened was your personal experience and life but talking about it openly that too in a way as if it were a joke just blew me off.
I really liked your content but after that I just couldn't.It was cringy af watching the audience and everyone present laughing their ass off at something which you should have been sorry for. There is a thin line between a joke and disrespect. I thought I could expect that from your content. Hey there! 
Firstly, a big ass congratulations on the Netflix Special. I haven’t laughed like that in a long time. Now here’s my question, i’m currently finishing up my class 12th ISC, and there’s a chance i may move to Australia for my undergrad. As a person who studied abroad, and why i’m asking you about this is because i value your perspective and opinion- do you think it’s wise to move out of the country at such a tender age of 17 turning 18? 

Looking forward to the new big announcement today! 
Kudos x Are you coming to Delhi this Year? Any plans? Are you sure you wanna say you are a comedian. I hear that our government is about pass an anti comedian bill. Standup comedians have essentially become the opposition in India. The only one who has the guts to comment on the govt. But the voice seems to be fragmented. Don't u think there needs to be some efforts in unifying the voice and make the space welcoming for future political satirist? Otherwise more flights are gonna ban u guys. [removed] Do I real with negative people just like conedians deal with hechlers ??? roast the shit outta them or just ignore and move on ??? I think you missed a lot of opportunities due to the delay in the release of Delhi Belly. How was that time for you? 🤔 How do you eat your biscuits ? Dunked in chai or dry ? If a fish and a bird were to fall in love where/on what terms will they live? Geographically and politically? let us know in as many 'colors' as you can :) 😈 What do you think is the difference between Indian comedy scene and the international? Hi Vir, how are you today? My questions are: How do you write your routines? Do you sit down at your study and write it as a whole at a particular time of the day by collecting small ideas throughout the day, or random thoughts and jokes at random times?

Also, when can we expect to see Go Goa Gone 2? Super excited about it. Is it the same Kunal Khemu, and Saif gang or are we seeing different people this time? It’s alright if you can’t reveal much. Anyway, FYI, I watched your first two LOVED tour shows live in Chembur and at Nariman point and I knew it was going to be a hit. Big fan of your work. :) What's your advice to people who wish to enter stand-up comedy in India? Which is your favourite indie band? Do you see yourself directing a movie in near future? If you can guest star in any TV show, which would it be and what kind of character would you want to play? When did u first seriously thought of being a commedian So what is your favorite cereal other than cornflakes? Did you install the blue door just for the Buland Darwaja joke? 
Also, did you know Akbar ke naam pe ek book hai? It's called Akbar Nama. Hi Vir. I think comedy is one of the best ways to express dissent in a democracy. I being a kashmiri am denied of basic fundamental rights right now at my home. Thought about making a netflix special just for the cause like Kashmir and numerous other states of India? When can we expect to see the ""Fresh Off the Boat"" spinoff starring you? Why did you stop potcast? Any chance you'll do a few potcast videos any time soon? Miss the lulli lamp! Hi Vir Das love your stand up routine do you plan to do stand up outside the Netflix platform. Do you browse reddit? Favorite subreddits? Do people confuse you to Ayushmann Khurrana ? Do you feel there is more scope for sketch comedy right now? 

We run a small sketch comedy collective in Bangalore it's been tough to get audience lately

Would really love some advice on this 1. The show in Arlington on 28th. New stuff?

2. Whiskey Cavalier, how was it supposed to go in the 2nd season? Hey Vir, Don't you think Lily Singh is over rated? I have 3 questions for you, hope its alright

1. What mistakes do you think, you made in your younger years when you were starting out or in general, that you would like the current young generation to avoid?

2. Who gives better content according to you? Modi G or Donald Trump?

3. What will you advise an aspiring stand up comedian regarding the process ?

Thank you! What is the one thing you would like to change in your past so that it won't affect your future (i.e now) but would make you feel better. Any plans to come back to Montreal for midnight surprise? What are you thoughts on the metoo movement in the Indian comedy circuit that happened last year? Loved your new show Vir ..how do you come up with the Material ,as in what's your approach to writing a set ..also what are some topics that you'll never touch  or not make fun of  .. Who is your favourite stand up comedian in the world? Good luck in Dubai Vir.....
Do you enjoy messing with people on twitter? I certainly enjoy all your interactions. Your replies to some of those people are excellent. That requires patience. So do you enjoy it, or is it just frustration coming out on the overly negative idiots sitting there thinking they're too smart? Did you invite Conan to India? What will you be if you weren't a standup/actor? Were you thinking to be a regular segment on conan, or news around the world (paraphrasing) was a one-off thing? Whta was the place you had Dal- Bati back in Jodhpur?
I tried to find it but failed. I just wanted to say I loved you in Delhi Belly! My good man. You have shat all over coffee drinkers in your new special. So my question to you is - How does Conon's hair stand-up so tall and is it really as red as it looks? And more importantly, isn't marie biscuit's soggability more than Parle-G? What about that!? Are you anytime bored with making others laugh? Hey Vir Das! Manboobs song was when I was first introduced to your content. 😂 I have a couple of questions.
How much has the stand up scene changed from the time you were a fresher? And if you could give any advice to a newcomer, what would it be?! Hi Vir! Would you be open to do a roast event in your style? Also, any plans for Jestination Unknown Season 2?

Loved your new special. Lost it at ""I want omelette"" bit, since the omelette thing happened in real life. Looking forward for your next soon.. Heyy! Is it possible for a comedian to ignore politics in such a politically charged atmosphere as now? Bro Vir Das, can you talk a bit about your days in Bihar? Where did you stay and how was your life like? What was the inspiration for the new special? I loved your new special! 
As someone who's done so many specials over the years,  is it tough to find new premises, and do you ever feel repetitive sometimes ? If yes, then how do you get over it ? How has the comedy scene evolved since you've started and how have you evolved with it? Are you the bravest of all Das' in the world? Are you using reddit app or any other client ? As a 19 year old student who has been closely watching the current situation in our country what do you suggest I can do to change the perspective of my parents and other family members about the ruling party and the events taking place?

I love your personality and your first Netflix special changed the way I thought about many things so thank you for that. Will we be seeing you in Shaheen bagh? Loved your recent act. Huge fan of yours ever since you did a set at my old college (BITS-Pilani).

Are there any notable differences in college crowds' reception to comedy in the US vs in India? -Advice for aspiring standup writers, not looking to be performer?

-Does it ever bother you that some part of your funny becomes repetitive? It's still going to be great material, but is your integrity as a comic unsatisfied?

-Thank you for all your work helping out students amidst exam's pressure and bridging the gap between what us Indians (and humanity in general) find funny. Loved the potcasts are they going to be back? Any plans on coming to Oregon? When is the sequel to Go Goa Gone coming? Hey, Angreji Hasyakalakar ;) , do you like dark humor ? And what's your favorite dark joke ? AirIndia, BSNL and now LIC put on sale by the current Indian government. Which do you think will go on sale next? How many death threats do you receive for you political stance? And does your company accept interns? How do you work on your bits? Do you have a favourite local spot where you test them? My sister and I have been watching your show on Netflix since 2 days during our dinner time, I love it! What kind of reaction were you expecting during your transition from being an actor to a comedian, how different were the results? Hello! Firstly a huge fan :) You're the first stand up comedian I've ever watched live and you're still the greatest one I've watched live. I loved your new special! 
Secondly here's my question: What are your top 3 book recommendations? 
Thanks Vir! I’ve been commenting on your Instagram account asking you to please do a show in Sri Lanka !! When are you coming here ? #creepyobsessedfan Out of all the movies you have done, is there any movie you hate to remember?

Ps: can't wait to watch you in go goa gone 2. What according to you is the main difference between the stand-up scene abroad and here in India? Which one do you enjoy more? Which politician do you think would bring a positive change in the country ? The BJP is ruining the country , Congress has dug its own grave , aap is only regional . Do you see any alternative ?

Edit : one more question. Is it feasible for us Indians to be like the Japanese and build up our nation ? I was reading about Japan the other day and came to know that they were completely isolated from the outside world for 200 years and when they opened up under US pressure , they achieved 300 years of industrial revolution in 20 years. Why has it not happened in India ? Is our ' chalta hai ' attitude to be blamed ? Are you interested in doing a satire show on indian politics, like American late night shows? Your special, Abroad Misunderstanding made me cry. Thank you for that. I love your humour and your views.

Keep on doing what you do! 💛 I'm in the same high school as you, can you remember any teacher who you liked/ disliked alot except for our former principle? With the possibility of headlining a tv show in America- will you be moving there more permanently? It is often said that art and politics of a country is a reflection of the society residing in that country. Do you think the stand up comedy culture of India is restricted because of the society? Do you believe that in the coming future it will open up more and possibly lead to the birth of an Indian George Carlin ? What do you think about Kapil Sharma?
(We're not related). Hey Vir. Which biscuits tho?

And what aspect of your humor, you think, appeals to audience globally? Hey, it's Archit (Jestination Unknown meme screenshot guy)
Was also there during you Loved Tour show in Townhall, NY
When will be your next show here? I love u Vir das u are the best comedian!!! Ever heard of Dehradun? 
You’ve got some big fans here! So i’m just gonna hand you the option of doing a show here whenever you decide to do an India tour 🙈
have a great day! Your take on kamra flights ban? Also, how is this political atmosphere similar/different to what is it is in the US? Loved the new special Vir! It was beautiful! As a comedian, what are the differences you see in India and abroad? Especially when it comes to people relating to the material?

What would it take for you to have chai and Parle G with my friends and I here in LA? Hi,1) Do comedians get away when they are politically incorrect? you know, just because you are supposed to be funny?  
2)  
Btw Loved your all specials on Netflix, So how does it fill to be Priyanka Chopra of Indian comedy? Hey Vir,
Thanks for doing the AMA. I haven’t caught up to the special yet but I liked the 1 minute glimpse Netflix threw at me. My question is: when you write your set or deliver it, do you restrict yourself anyway in jokes or body language so that  white people can get them? Do you think Indian humor is major puns? Please do stand up for Amazon prime also , I don't have netflix Most of your followers on Twitter seems fake. Do you think your material has declined since you got big time? Favourite films and/or TV shows of 2019? Are you planning to do a fourth Netflix special?

If so, when?

P.S: I absolutely loved for India and I laughed so hard that my neighbors actually got scared and came to check on me lmao How and when did social issues become an integral part of your comedy? Who is your favorite comedian? Don't mind, 

But isn't your name a bit ironical.? 

You are Vir, and yet you're a Das. When did you know you wanted to be a comedian, and what did you want to be when you were growing up? Congrats man. Standup is now being discussed in parliament. 



Would you perform for modiji and amitji?



I would love to see thier reaction. Can I be your good friend? Do people recognise you in public but wrong? Any plans of a show in Bangalore any time soon? How was Conan? Hey Vir, what was a big boost during your initial period of career... I think you got to play in movies also back then! What do you feel about the current political climate in India? Do you think the news media has been overshadowed and controlled by politicians? Have you every been invited to The Comedy Central roast?
If not, Will you go? Why does all his comments feel like written by AI fed with his performance scripts What is your guilty pleasure? How do you make a distinction between what is a good joke and what can be bit too much for a joke? Especially jokes on politics? How many joke ideas of yours don’t even see the light of day? What’s the revision funnel like? You are one of the only comedians I've loved to watch perform. I've seen 2 of your shows live and enjoyed them both. Just wanted to show my appreciation. Thanks for the laughs! All the best :) hi vir , i watched your stad up special . loved it. what are your thoughts on data privacy and surveillance. although it is not given any importance in our country Disappointed that Whiskey Cavalier ended.
Any chance if we could see you again soon in a show like this? How much do u spend on hats I've never laughed as hard when you were talking about Parle G and its structural integrity. That is relatable on a whole different level. Not exactly a question, but I saw you perform at the Navy Ball in Delhi sometime in December 2009, and I vividly remember you talking about how men don't buy their underwear, it's always their wife or mom. Then you turned to a very senior officer in the front and asked him what brand of underwear he wore, and then asked him ""Sir why are you looking at your wife!""

Do you get to perform for audiences like this these days? what are your thoughts about the current political and social situation in India? What is the one kick-ass thing about you that not many people are aware of?

Also, big fan!
May you achieve all the success. Parle g or marie for dipping in chai? Hi Vir. Do you think stand-up comedy can be learnt or is it something that ought to be inbuilt?

Who are your biggest present day influences in comedy? 

I saw you tried to deliver a lot like Hasan Minhaj, structure some jokes like Chappelle and also modify tweets as long-ass jokes. Hey man! You've spent a lot of time working abroad the past few years. Is there anything you wish people back in India should be more aware of? 

What would be your biggest take away from living a more international life? Just saw your recent Netflix special and the one at San Francisco as well. Loved them both. A huge fan of yours btw!
When are you getting back here again? Any plans on collaboration in the near future with any prominent Indian stand-up comedian for a sketch or anything? would you be coming to New York this year? I would love to see you perform Is the AMA over? I always thought the hate and war mongering could always come out in uneducated and underexposed people but how come intellectuals like Vivek Agnihotri and others like him could not see the big picture? Hi Vir Das. Are there any plans for you to perform in Bhubaneswar? People would absolutely love to have you here!! If you could go back in time any point of life once. When would it be and why? Hi Vir! I love your shows!! Are you planning on coming to Canada anytime soon ? Who is your favorite comedian worldwide?
Also, who do you think has great content in India? What do you make of all the sexist jokes that so called popular comedians say on their shows and most people in Bollywood? Have you ever faced backlash for making jokes on present government? What do you think about the current situation in India ? How would you describe your Twitter handle in one word? Are you an atheist or are you a believer? How longer have you spent writing the whole new episode? What struggles and situations happen that turned into a better idea? I'm asking this as a writer to understand more nuances to the style. Is reddit popular with any of our Indian mainstream comics?  Anyone of them active here? How do I convince the uncles in my family group that Muslims are not commodities who can be thrown out of the country and 'Hindu pride' (omg, whatever that is) is utter bullshit. They are brainwashed. They say economic front pe hi toh fail hua hai Modi, he is working hard on other important matters. What language should I use so they understand better? Your thoughts on joining the government? You might be better at it. As it is, it seems the politicians are practicing stand up in speeches. 😂 You have wonderful creative way of seeing the comedy out of daily events.

Could you recommend a few things you do to cultivate that creativity.

How do you manage your ideas, do you write your ideas and make a script or do you come up with a context and then add comedy in there.
How do you do it?

I wish I could add some comedy to my daily activities. I just don't know how to do it.

Very sorry its a long question. Please reply whatever you like out of these.

Thanks What would you do if you are in a flight and sitting next to Arnub Goswami? Just want to tell you that you were amazing in Go Goa Gone. Is there any sequel 'cooking'? Edit: He's gone. Imagine yourself in the Nayak movie in place of anil kapoor.. What would you do? Your top 3 stand up specials of all time? Do you want to come to IIT Dharwad for our very first Cult fest? We are kinda low on budget tho. 😬😬 5 yr plan, Vir? #HRquestion Hve you ever watched Andrew Schulz ? You tried something similar ? Who are your Top 10 all time favorite American/Non-American Stand Up Comedians? Why do you choose to constantly comment on the issues in india, when you could play safe and focus on jokes? And when you've criticised any party/community  have you received any threats? What's the one advice would you give to the youth of India, for this transitional period we as a country are going through? What are your favorite biscuits? What would be the best advice you would give to an aspiring stand up comedian? When you first started out, what was the worst show you had to do for the sake of exposure? Are Bollywood walas are in any position to lecture us? Where do you stand on the Kunal Kamra issue? Hey, Thanks for doing this. 

1. What is your favorite one-line joke?
2. Which place has been your dream place to perform in? When are you starting your potcasts again??!! And also other types of videos on your YouTube channel??! Please be active on YouTube again . I saw your ""Be Stupid"" speech and it was amazing , please make these kinda speeches more.
(People please upvote this if u also want that to happen) What dating/socializing advice would you give to an introvert Indian student who's going to States for studies? why haven't you been able to develop a decent routine despite exhausting all the predictable punch lines and trying all the mainstream standup formulas? Yo Vir, do you plan on doing Santa Banta 2? Why don't popular people like comedians, directors etc form their own political party and run for government? Do you think it's a possibility in the future? Kunal Kamra, Anurag Kashyap, Varun Grover, Swara Bhaskar etc? Hey Vir, big fan here. I've got one question for you.
Is Cereal soup? My friend [Naresh](http://imgur.com/gallery/THQFx5N) looks like you, can you confirm this?

I never stop telling him he looks like you whenever we meet. Why did you oppose Arrey? It's crucial for the metro and decongestion of the city of Mumbai. I loved you on Fresh Off the Boat, how's the cast like in real life. Are they similar to how they seem on the Show, and between you and Mr. Huang, who will be a wiser dad Hey Vir, I’m a white lady who speaks a few different Indian languages sings in 9 of them and lives in India... (ayyy I do some comedy too!) Ive seen hugely different attitudes towards me from Indians vs Americans. What do you think about American views on cultural appropriation? How the hell did you knot run out of tea while filming Vir Das for India ?

Also what's you favorite thing about dehradun ( since you were born here ) ? What's your writing process like? What differentiates a good set from a truly MEMORABLE one? What is the most awkward moment of your acting career? Your Allah who Akbar joke was the bomb. Brownie points for those who get it Do you have any plans to go forward with more parody movies in the near future? I mean it's a shame we are not seeing something like go Goa gone after so many years (although stree did fill that gap).

Are you in talks with those 2 dudes for future projects? Odd timing for an AMA isn't it? Do you think the comedy scene in India is immature? 

Specifically, I feel that comparing comedians like Carlin, Burr or Lewis CK go into monogloues that highlight larger issues while being satirical or sarcastic, while most comedy in India is around simpler jokes?

If so, do you forsee this changing any time soon? Your bit on ""Tamil Nadu blacky blacky "" part in your standup was pretty racist, I don't know how you got away with it Do you have any beef with Kunal Kamra or was it just a twitter spat ? according to you what do you think as an actor what matters the most your acting your physic our your good looks ? Nothing to ask just want to say you are hilarious,  love your shows.  Hopefully you visit Kolkata and i can attend your show. What names have you been called? (I know one, Vir Das ->Weird aas) TV news is pretty much dead. Is it inevitable that Comedians will play the role of news reporters in this decade in India? How fillet mignon tastes like compared to Indian cuisine ? 

Parle-G & parle-G Gold what's the difference ? Is the fresh off the boat spinoff actually happening??? Are you open to doing a full set on poltics in India What do you think of CAA/NRC and shaheen bag protests? You think the country has finally woken up to the nightmare they put on themselves in 2014? Do you sometimes feel that if your jokes were more pro govt, you'd get more success and more support from the public? If so, how do you shake off that feeling and continue with your brand of comedy? How does it feel to represent India .. which is a mix between the two extremes. Do you feel ashamed or indifferent",2020-02-06 11:30:43
Politics,Whatsapp unkils are becoming too powerful,118,fmhuqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmhuqs/whatsapp_unkils_are_becoming_too_powerful/,43,"Just 3 hours ago,

A medical scientist researching Infectious Disease, for the US Government in Houston who was my classmates in college.

And our friendships are equally deep after his departure to America.

Got a call from him.

His first sentence was,

""Devendra Ji,

* Our PM Modi is some great man, probably.

I said

""Hey, he is, but what did he do now?""

He said, ""We have been doing research in India for the last 30 years on Infectious Disease, but this idea of 1 day curfew never came to our mind.""

I asked, ""Are you also making fun of Modi like seculars, leftists, Muslims, Thukde Thukde Gang, Urban Naxalites, Award Returning Gangs, AAP, NDTV etc in India?""

He said, ""Oh nothing like that, I and my whole family have been citizens of America for 19 years, My annual salary is more than 15 crores in Indian rupees, But the hearts are still Indian.

Every major step and decision of Modi is completely separated from politics, I wish the welfare of India and human beings I also saw Lakhs of Indians are making fun of Modi's 1 day self-imposed curfew, But in our laboratory, a 45-minute official meeting of all the big scientists has just been convened to discuss this announcement of Modi.

You would be surprised, this 45-minute meeting lasted for more than 3 hours, with a 1-day self-imposed curfew to discuss contagious diseases and its impact on Covid 19 in particular,

All scientists were of the opinion that, 12 hours is a very effective way to prevent the spread of corona virus by cutting every person from the world, Because Covid cannot survive for more than 12 hours on any surface outside the human body.

In such a situation, being cut off from the outside world, inanimate objects such as door handles, Currency notes, files, courier parcels, Steering wheels of vehicles Viruses on pens etc. will be completely eliminated, And without spending a single penny in this manner as suggested by Modi, Since there is no loss of work due to Sunday,

* The country will be almost free from viruses! * These ideas were not thought of in the minds of the world's highest level scientists of this subject

If any of his advisors has given this advice to Modi then this person is entitled to the Nobel Prize, and if the great idea is the brainchild of Modi, then he should get the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his contribution in the medical field of Infectious Disease. ""*

I could not even speak a word.

Here, crores of people of my country are making fun of Modi, Humiliating him as illiterate,

: Devendra Singhvi 20/03/2020

Tldr: modi is a genius and we're blessed to be under his rule",somerandomredittor," It's funny how every narrative around isolation has became ""because modiji said it"". Researchers in US with 15 crore salary lmao I think the author is being sarcastic. Either way, it's a good example for Poe's law. I don't have a high opinion of myself on my intelligence but these people sure boost my confidence UNESCO had rightly declared Modiji as the best PM in the world. i know.... he can line everyone up to prove their citizenship..he can line them up to prove their virusity? virility? ....can build detention camps so can build quarantine camps ..... csomething something assam. The North Koreans are compelled to believe their leader is God. Here, you don't need force because people are toppers of WhatsApp University. F The guy mention in the post and his medical fraternity is just as real as the girl I lost my virginity to last year.

PS. There is not enough evidence to concur how long the virus survives outside also how heat affects its spread.

https://youtu.be/FrrsXCxs2xg r/that_happened But doesn't the virus have different life spans on different materials? Always, someone “unnamed” will be giving this kind of information. If you would, please share your US friend’s name and title, we will get in touch with him to clarify. Probably, it will be good for US medical fraternity knew him very well by know. 

Don’t spread fake news with someone anonymous, without a name. Is this true? [deleted] Downvoted , enough is enough

This shit isn't funny any more k",2020-03-22 00:43:40
Politics,Even Yamraj will resign after Delhi violence: Shiv Sena,197,ff8nd8,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/even-yamraj-will-resign-after-delhi-violence-shiv-sena-1653576-2020-03-08,21,,itsblockchain," Well, Yamraj is also the Lord of Dharma. He would probably fry these sanghi pricks in boiling oil for what they have done. Good fucking good. Can't believe shiv sena has really said all those things. Their politics is also religion based and few years back they were the most communal before bjp took over and became fifty times worst. Still can't believe shiv sena is talking so sensibly. Looks like some social activist wrote this article. This gives me hope. Religion apne jagah hai but insaniyat ki limit me politics honi chahiye. Uske upar nahi. Yamraj is more of a man than these scums will ever be Tadipar must be feeling flattered that he is getting compared with Yamraj. Goddamn. That editorial in Saamna is gold. Shiv Sena better fucking shut up. They are the same shit! Hate peddling assholes!

Politics,Do You Wonder Why People Are Opposing CAA & NRC? Actor Sushant Singh Explains,671,f7mat4,https://youtu.be/o4ZSpqpfvQs,126,,sudden_dust," #Translation.

There is a lot of confusion regarding CAA and NRC. Many people are supporting it and many are against it. I am against it. Those who are supporting it, I want to ask them some questions. Many are saying that NRC law has not been formulated so why are you protesting. 

NRC is already here as a part of citizenship amendment act 2003, only rules for NRC have not been declared. Government is saying that no Indian citizen will be harmed, they don't have to worry about anything. But it is same question, which comes first, ""egg or hen""? 

Because in NRC, you have to first prove that you are indian citizen and if you are found non indian and some harm will fall on you. Then government will say that they have already told no Indian citizen will be harmed and you are not Indian. And this can happen to anyone. 

For example, in NRC in Assam, my wife is from Manipur and her ancestral property is in Assam. Everyone from her family was found indian except her younger brother. Now, he have to visit Foreigner tribunal to prove that he is indian. Isn't it a good joke, his parents are indian, siblings are indian but he is not. He had all the documents and he had shown it. We are saying, we won't show documents but he did and still found as foreigner. And data shows that those who are found foreigner in Assam NRC, 97% can't prove that they are indian. 

You are saying that according to NRC, non muslims will get citizenship. Think about it, who will get citizenship. People from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan will get citizenship in CAA. The genuine indian who don't have name in NRC, the foreign tribunal will declare them as non indian. What they will do, where they will he go. They have to declare themselves as citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan and have to apply for citizenship. But what will happen to their past history because they already accepted that they are illegal immigrant. Will their job be valid? will their marriage be valid? will the citizenship of their children be valid? Will their property be valid? Maybe not? 

If you have lawyer friends, ask them. In Assam NRC, about 19 lakh people are declared non indian, out of which 13 lakh are non-muslim, indian. Are they going to be benefited by CAA? Zero. 

Now, you will say that NRC law has not been declared, neither any rules have been declared, so why the protest? There is a lot of confusion and how can we believe government. Government is saying indian citizen have nothing to worry about. But they also said that NRC was never going to be implemented, our PM said this. But our HM, SC and parliament said that NRC will happen and worms will be thrown out. 

Everyone is saying NRC and NPR are different. But in rulebook of NRC, NPR is first step. One minister is saying that NPR is like census. This is a way to gave benefits of government schemes to citizens. But isn't that what Aadhar is for? 

Then another minister is saying that NPR data may or may not be used for NRC. Every minister should held a session, talk among themselves, form a single opinion and then show in written that what will or will not happen. 

Fear mongering is done by you, this is why people are fearful. So, clarify to us if NRC will happen or not. Tell us details about it, what documents will be needed because HM said in an interview that Aadhar is not valid, even in aadhar card it is written that it's not a proof of citizenship. Which documents will be required, so that we start collecting those documents, our parents birth certificate, our birth certificate. 

If spelling of our name is different in various documents which are issued by government like driving licence, voter id, pan card, passport, and aadhar card, what will happen. These 5 documents are nearly is to everyone. Is there anyone whose name is slightly different is these 5 documents, whose father's name is slightly different because this is what happened in Assam NRC. Father's name is slightly different in various documents. In one it is Fazal, in another it is Faizal. In one it is Samer, in another Samir. These people are declared foreigner in Assam NRC and put in detention centre. If they tell us than we can clear these confusion. 

Because of Assam NRC, in detention centre nearly 28 people died. A 1 and half month baby also died. Total 100 people died, some died of shock and some committed suicide. 

Now, I want to ask one question to people supporting CAA on humanitarian basis. You want to throw away illegal muslim immigrants. Fair enough. But Bangladesh has said that it want in written that no illegal immigrant will be send to Bangladesh. And if somehow we convince Bangladesh to take them back, they will also check names in their register. If 5 lakh illegal muslim immigrants are found and 2 lakh out of them are found to be bangladeshi. Then what will happen to those 3 lakh people. Where will government put them, in detention centre for life, till they die? If a whole family is found illegal immigrant that is government is going to put them in detention centre together?  If yes, than will they have reproduction rights? Because there is limited space in detention centre and you can't increase population. 

So, what will happen to these illegal muslim immigrants, who are put in detention centre, deprived of job, property and any reproduction rights? They will spend their whole life in detention centre. 

So, you will put these human in detention centre just because they are muslims, who will not have reproduction rights, who will stay in detention centre till they die, like criminals. Is it humane? Are you going to walk away from them, forget that these people are in some corner of our country, living a life even worse than animals? And all this is being done on name of majority. He is wrong. Muslims sent to detention centres will not be kept there forever. Eventually RWers will start making the point that ""these termites are being fed and housed with taxpayer money"", and they will be exterminated. This will probably not happen with Modi/Shah as PM/HM, but with Yogi/Pragya as PM/HM this is a certainty. This deserves far more views. Finally I understand why are people against NRC . But I still didn't understand Why are people against CAA. 

Please can someone explain

Edit:- Thank you all. 

  I am a 15 year old and my father is a Bhakt so he tells me it's a good act and does not let me read or see anything about CAA or NRC.

Edit 2:-

I showed him. He tells it's all false information They already know it, and That is why they want it more that anything. Real life hero. #Perfectly explained and the reason why everyone should participate before it’s too late. Got an English language equivalent?

It is scary on how much similarities the ss of germany and rss of bjp have

Edit : grammar What about Atheist / Anglositic ? 

What about people who don't believe in religion ? 

They will also be kicked or slapped their views on them ? the problem is not CAA or NRC. The problem is today in india people are not sad becuase they had losses but they are sad because their neighbours are in profit.

I heard people in shaheen bagh say that govt give affidavit that CAA will not be used in NRC because they will give citizenship to non muslim not them Real hero, salute to this man. ACTOR sushant singh explains ;) Those who are opposing CAA, do they know if there are any Pakistani muslims staying in India? Are they opposing CAA to save those Pakistani Muslims? Why? Why would any one want Pakistani muslims to come illegally in India and stay? [removed] Illogical video. Based on imagined problems. The basic premise which he has got wrong is that the country wide NRC is not going to be like the Assam NRC. The Assam NRC had some specific requirements because of the Assam Accord. Sushant Singh has completely ignored this fact. Yo what's with this trend of regarding opinion of actors as some godly knowledge ?!

Edit: Added original article link that is going viral.",amzed_can," Have you posted this on Facebook? I want to share this Great work on the replies and the links! I would suggest adding more, and as many as possible (we can help!) so this becomes a sort of mega post with sources that we can share with whoever encourages stupidity and blind worship of the govt. I see that the original article has no links or sources where as you provided sources. That's what these people do they rely on their flimsy opinion as whatsapp needs no sources but to prove them even to people that don't support them they need sources. Anyway great work. The fuck the target post reads like my 6th standard school essay. What shitty level of sycophantic behaviour is this. Isn't this the same article that was posted on rediff ? Who even believes this is written by someone who is not a BJP supporter? I don't even bother getting into an argument with people who post these (which rather sadly was done by atleast 5 people on my timeline who went to premier institutions in the country - all were priveleged upper class Hindus even before I met them during my post grad). I feel like it's impossible to change someone who is well read and still blindly supports everything the government does. The chance that they will turn on BJP at some point of time is the same as me voting for BJP anytime in the future. I wasn't a big fan of Modi (2002 riots) but was hopeful of a sea change in India's development and corruption with the majority they had. 5 years of Modi has all but buried that hope forever. In a country of 1.3 billion people it's a miracle we have a PM that an overwhelming majority would listen to and I would love to be proved wrong about him by the way he leads us through this crisis. Our economy is going to take a while to recover with the US economy already crashing but if we come out of this with competitively less human casualty I would he appreciative of Modi for doing so This is my take from it.

These facilities are exactly the things we pay tax for. Delhites are anti-national now XD This is just an abomination. He's literally dissing out on Delhiites for not voting for BJP on national television, sitting in Delhi!

This is unbelievable. I love it. Good to see them whine. But wait until the actual results are out. A fraud who was in jail for blackmail is a primetime anchor. Only in India. Isko Kalapani bhejo. [removed] Why the fuck should local elections be fought on national issues? People of Delhi are thankfully smart enough to see the difference, you can't win every election using Modi's name. Bc is convincing his viewers that the rational choice is the wrong one. Advocating to vote based on fear mongering over progress. How tf are people swayed by these morons Tihar chaudhary::Bahut dard hota hai modiji

Tihar chaudhary:: modiji gaand mein dard hota hai Fuck Sudbury chaudhary. He is as much a douche as arnab lol. Delhi voters too educated to fall for shit? That's the complaint? really?! NaZee news anchor breaks down on hearing loss of his ideology Even added the ""not afraid of Mughal rule"". Wow. Shame, shame. These Godi media people have completely sold their souls. Is this really happening?? Such blatant disrespect and nonsense. Is he a journalist??? No he is worst of the available scum. Kaisa dalal aadmi hai yeh [removed] Merchants of hate . They always tries to blame some group or other and create wedges between communities.. so that they can get trps or funds. 

Stop giving them trps and behaviour like this will automatically come down. Bhai don't insult journalists by calling him one. What a vile human being! There's a reason for conducting legislative assembly elections. They should rightly only care about local issues.  

And by saying that, he accepted that BJP won't be able to solve delhi's local issues. Only thing needed were his tears at the end. It would have been glorious. National Issues lul chutiya fo to people think 370 is 'solved'. There's a reason net isn't there yet. It's far from normal.  


And Ram Mandir was created a issue by BJP itself. Congrats for solving it. Ispe FIR daalna chahiye for Defamation of People of Delhi :)
/s I had a smile throughout the rant. Thank you bokachoda. Your frustration of your propaganda not working soothes my heart. I will sleep a little peacefully tonight. I'm waiting for part 2 of this Randi Rona when AAP will make the government again What else is he gonna do? Go crying to his momma that no one's voting for who he wants. Kaisa chutiya hai ye. Also, please stop watching Zee News people. Subscriptions bhi hata do. Abey g@@ndu. This was the same delhi that gave you 7/7 in Lok sabha elections. Where was your ass then? People should watch the whole episode. It's the most incoherent rant ever. And it gives you a glimpse into bjp's mind. .. it looks like he's reading straight out of some dossier which was handed to him by mota bhai... Ironically **he's** the one who has been to Tihar Jail. A douchebag for life lol chutiya kahika.  ""My vote is my vote it's non of your vote"" good gawd this guy was close to tears . Freebies ? Asshole I’m paying taxes for socialist health care and education. It’s you who is getting freebies from the government to spread hate. >dilli ki janta araam se jeena chahti hai

Who the fak doesn't want to live peacefully..

So now he wants the whole nation to hate delhi..
Let's keep dividing.. 

I dont get it.. how can somepeople just keep going like this without a shred guilt.. This is actually great. More and more people are going to realize what gobar they stepped into by watching their channel. So he does not understand the concept of taxes We should not give a shit about these ass licking mafas..
Constitution is gonna win on 11.02.2020
Somebody has set the political discourse of this country to a good direction and showed these people how elections should be fought. And what are the national issues that you talk about?

Ram Mandir? - Fuck you. That ain't one.
Article 370? - Fuck you again. They do care about it, but not the way you want them to.

This guy is the insane. Such a shit show 
Bhai alag level ka chutiyap karta hai yeh Tihadi saala How can people fuck this guy? Lmao this is hella funny. He is literally saying that people are voting on the basis of state issues in a state election. Wtf It seems BJP is not getting even the 3 seats they won last time Ab humko ye tihadi btaega kya krna hai Bc what a fuckrr we have in our society who directly spits on the face of citizens of capital! Bsdka how he can decide what people will do with their vote?? Bc tum jaiso ko hatane keliye hi vote kiya hai! Tu Tihari bass Dilli aa ab. Tereko batate hai Dilli waale phir apni baasha mai. Can someone ask ""Mr. Sudhir Chaudhary"", What are the roles of Members of Legislative Assembly in ""NATIONAL ISSUES"" like 370,Ram Mandir? I don't think this guy understands the essence of democracy. Pure selfishness and self-preservation. You vote for the things and people that matter to you, improve your life and most importantly preserve your life and liberty. 

If anyone still watches this channel because they think it's news, they are a lost cause. Right, so he's basically saying delhiites are intelligent? daaaaaaaamn! case studies will be done in indian journalism courses on this guy. Bloody cry babies I am from Delhi and female, dont live there though now. What I have understood by talking to family and friends is women in Delhi have not turned communal but most of the men have. Also younger generation below 22 dont care about issues like religion. Contrast to other states most are heavily communal I think this will backfire and embolden the rest of the population who didnt vote for AAP to shift towards AAP lol. what the fuck. We all know what he does but what the shit is this. I am disgusted. LMAO, he was sadder than the actual candidates who are going to lose. Negging but doing it on a whole city At times like these I'm glad Hindi isn't that widespread in my state :') so much bile. It's not even a year since Delhi gave BJP a resounding 7 out of 7 MP seats and this guy goes on rant against them. Bakwas kare jo anchor ko, danda do gaand mein ek do He's become mad in “BHAKTI“ Maovadi Sudheer chaudhary. Well he is frustrated lol. Though I'm really disappointed by the low turnouts. Delhi people decided not to vote for anyone this time. So Mr. Chaudhary's statement is totally wrong. If anything they didn't care about the freebies enough. Another anchor and channel that needs to be boycotted... He’s our desi Tucker Carlson lol Bhai isko koi burnol do People should boycott zee news Sudhir went full copeshwar mode yesterday it was glorious to watch. I hope these exit poll predictions come true so i can see him cry even more *Dard dilo ke kam ho jaate,  Dilli wale anti-national kam ho jaate* was this sarcasm? WTF!! You want them to care about national issues like unemployment, stalling economy, and corruption? Because if they do, they'll be put on the streets protesting. lol People can vote for whatever reasons they deem is important. For some people ram temple is important, for some having drinking water. What is ""right"" or ""wrong"" is a matter of perspective. Thinking clearly we'd call Delhi voters Fascist bigots if they voted for BJP Lol he is in mega cope mode. He is right though about the low turnout.

Politics,"Support to BJP rises as Educational qualification goes up, India Today Post Poll Study suggests!",427,f32uwt,https://i.redd.it/sns1998zrlg41.jpg,246,,Gavthi_Batman," Looks like identity politics at play here. Low education often implies poverty or lower middle class populace which thrives on basics - roti, kapda, makaan. 

Higher ups in the chain yearn for a higher ladder of Maslow's hierarchy. Which they think BJP gives them, with its identity politics.

Good thing is they're often more open to listening and changing their stance (if you present your arguments in a way palatable to them) . So at this point I'd rather be AAP than BJP.

But again, Delhi politics is hardly a good indicator for national or politics of other poorer states. Can read WhatsApp forwards faster Higher the degree, greater the bigotree. Having a degree and being educated are not the same thing even though people tend to use them interchangeably.

If a rocket scientist with two PhDs thinks Ram was shooting nuclear missiles from horseback or eating pork deserves a special place in hell can you really call him educated? Unless you consider being able to read and do math as the only benchmarks of education I would not.

An educated person should mean someone who can hold a conversation on any topic under the sun for at least a few minutes. Have the ability to analyze and change his stance as the facts present themselves. This should correlate to castes; as upper-castes are more literate due to the opportunities they get to obtain higher education, as the responsibilities of supporting their families don't fall on their shoulders early, except in rare cases. A large chunk of upper-castes are known to be BJP supporters though a significant portion of them do not support BJP too. Maybe the privileged(rich) that get into higher courses have a higher percentage than others, and it's the privileged that support BJP the most? This is simply because AAP focuses their work on lower classes who are generally uneducated/ less educated instead of creating false narratives that interests a section of psuedo- educated middle/upper-middle class. A poor person is bound to not give a shit about ""hindu khatre mei hai"" when their basic needs are in danger but that's a story to please those with normal lives with a desperation to show their communal nationalism. The actual problem is that people with higher educational qualifications are usually middle class, upper-middle class.

They are self sufficient enough to be indoctrinated with capitalist pure ideology. They assume that if the poor people just ""work hard"", they can too improve their living standard and ignore the ground reality that these people only have their labour to sell and even the hardest working proletariat survives on a bare minimum wage so there is no additional income or savings to reinvest for a better quality of life.

And the reason for this is our education system that encourages you to learn and repeat instead of learn and think. Our system has given them a degree but not the ability to think. The real reason as witnessed first hand is my parents/grandparents frustration with 'freebies' given by AAP.

Somehow, they feel it's their hard earned money that's being given away to appease voters. If AAP has to go national, it needs to counteract that perception. If you think of it, all the good initiatives by AAP do nothing for the middle and upper-middle class and beyond.

P.S. I donated 10k and fought my family day and night this election season, don't downvote me please. This is surprising and also not. The poor and the illiterate benefitted a lot more from AAP than from BJP I think more than half of my department professors at IITM support BJP and a lot of them are hardcore sanghis.
Education doesn't mean shit. https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html

I think this could explain it partially This was expected. There's wealth and therefore educational disparity between different communities.

Muslims and lower castes are much poorer and therefore much less educated.

I'd be more interested in a survey of educated people with respect to their population share.

[Data shows upper-caste voters of both BJP and Congress support core Hindutva issues](https://theprint.in/opinion/data-shows-upper-caste-voters-of-both-bjp-and-congress-support-core-hindutva-issues/320208/)

Lower castes tend to be much less religious than upper castes. Maybe a smaller sample but Dalits and most lower caste top writers on Quora tend to be liberals. It's mostly about how you were raised up by your parents. Literacy is an entirely different aspect. Many of us fear house lizards thinking it is venomous but it is not. We come to think of it as told by our parents and we never bothered to research coz it didn't have any correlation with our success later in life.

Same goes for every other thing. If one is told from one's childhood that these particular people are untouchables or Muslims are dangerous it gets entrenched in the memory. If a child grows up hearing derogatory / over-generalized comments about Muslims or any other sect, he is bound to develop such feelings within himself. Our education system doesn't address this problem. 

There are very few of us who are curious. Who like to question the status-quo. Who want logical answers. This sole characteristic of a person differentiates him/her from the herd mentality. This is what education should teach. Not the rote learning and hours of solving calculus and end up hating your brothers out there with whom you can develop an India that was once imagined. A truly secular place. A true Brotherhood. If it was the other way round, everyone would say  ""bhakths are so uneducated haha"" If seen closely AAP still has more Post Graduate Voters than BJP but still trends are pretty worrying as Educated ones can't differentiate facts from Propaganda!

My masters are from WhatsApp university. Bullshit survey and where is the link to the study/data. Not really surprised. Literacy in the highest levels in this country is for the privileged. The privileged upper middle class/upper class are in general more bigoted and not bothered with the free initiatives done for the poor by AAP. They don't care for Delhi Government schools, they care for the poshest International school.  They don't care for Moholla clinics but the best Apollo treatment money can buy. I always thought it would be other ways... How accurate is this survey? NGL. Definitely expected it would be the other way around IMO with increased education, one develops the capability to discover the agenda behind rants and promises of the political discourses. Also they are able to determine the general direction where the political parties would like to steer the nation. I always felt more education would improve the country and make them be more rational in their decisions. But as a well educated person myself I feel ashamed that people with very little to no education have shown more maturity. They haven't fallen prey to divisive tactics but recognized good governance. I wonder whether the uneducated people are equally communalized as the educated ones, but since the uneducated are generally poor => free electricity and stuff impacts them way more than the educated/rich swaying their support. 

After all, all of these people would still vote for Modi in Lok Sabha. Well a professor in my college still shares ‘hindu khatre mein hain’ posts on fb, he also shares patriarchal shit too (can’t stand girls with a fashion sense) so bjp supporting & bigotry goes hand in hand with boomers. This chart should also show caste. I'd say it's more a factor of caste than education. Basically majority of those educated upto post-graduate support AAP in Delhi and a surge of Professional degree holders support BJP. What degrees are included in professional? Doctors, MBAs and lawyers? this seems too spooky to be true. Even if it is increasing we can't ignore the fact that the AAP's vote share is similar to BJP even at the post graduate level. So does that mean mudi support AAP? Considering BJP only won the areas abutting UP , I really doubt this conclusion. Maslow's hierarchy of needs. While others are voting for basic stuff , the upper castes , with higher degree of education, are voting for self esteem needs like Hindu Rashtra and India Vishwaguru etc. Because they are hungry for a feeling of  supremacy. Supremacy of nation, religion and caste. From my personal experience: Better the college you are from, lesser the chance of being a bjp supporter i.e. iit bombay guy is less likely to be a bjp supporter compared to a lower tier engg college guy could not understand why they opted for this type of graph, simple bar chart would suffice. its not a time/life bound to show in linear way This shows education doesn't give you wisdom. The same poor people voted for BJP in the general elections. So it's the freebies which played a crucial part. And all the analogies of educated people being bigots and all is plain stupid. Next you'll call poor people voting for BJP in general elections as bigots. Fir sabhi bigots ho jayenge Kya? Just here to bust the party. AAP is getting support from poor people because it is a socialist party focused on welfare. The middle and upper classes are the ones affected by this the most while the lower classes are happy Fuck It's likely that wealth is a confounding variable here, affecting both education and voting preference, and there's no causal relationship b/w the two. I might be wrong here but I think this correlation does not imply causation. A person with higher education is very likely to be older as compared to a person with a lower qualification.  


This trend would then translate to 'age' vs 'BJP support' plot. It makes much more sense to me that generally, senior generation is much more likely to vote for BJP than the younger one. The only way to check the validity of this hypothesis is through the original survey data. But still, the age trend makes a lot more intuitive sense to me. Why are professional degrees mentioned after post grad? B. Tech is a professional degree and most B. Techs in India are peabrained. JNU with bjp confirmed ? Correlation does not mean causation. Caste and religion. These are important factors for the so-called educated. It is just a Poll. It does not mean shit. For all we know, all BJP supporters marked themselves as highly educated... Someone did not read causal relationship. [deleted] How many of them are geezers? Damn looks like kejriwal's schools are actually giving education Predicted is the keyword here. Don't believe every graph published in a magazine. Lots of hidden agendas everywhere. Padhe likhe unpadh! Rutt Lena doesn’t mean you’re educated lol. It means you’re a chutia with a “degree” and possibly full of shit and more likely to feel elitist. So they can read Wahstapp forwards. caste defines education level The traitorous middle class of this country is so divorced from the ground realities of existence and steeped in prejudices that they are easy grab for the BJP. Where does modi fall in this chart Keeping aside the fact that most top caste and educated people support Bigoted BJP,


We have lot of *hululu colleges* granting degrees, master degrees and PhDs.  Can we really consider all graduates as equal and better than non-graduates? is this what padha likkha gavaar means? Mental gymnastics is real All i see is that rich fucks who can afford higher education support BJP, big surprise. Again this chutiya report. This was based on 14,000 people only and done by India today axis not any government body. The more education you have the less you'll care i have not understood this at all. 

If i think about Rwanda genocide, or any of the major atrocities in africa, or history of india (partition), or Trump supporters, i tend to attribute it to lower education. Surely, if you are more educated, you should know how propaganda works, how hate mongering works.   


But then i think about india. The educated ones are the ones who are most communalized. Then i think about Nazis, who were also some of the most educated of the people.   


So, education is not really the solution to communalization. Then what is? How do we teach people to be compassionate? People ripping on upper caste people for being wealthy crack me up. Maybe just maybe by living according to the values of an upper caste person, typically great emphasis on education, etc one can also achieve class mobility. And before people take about privilege and shit, my “upper class family” was poor as shit. Also I have never seen such blatant anti upper caste reservation policies as I’ve seen in India. So go fuck yourselves

Also I’ve never believed you’re born and die in the same caste. Caste comes from profession. If you were born as a Dalit, I firmly believe that you can become. Brahmin based upon your profession eg scholarly aptitude I'm guessing this poll takes a group of people and asks them what their educational qualification is and if they support BJP. Is that correct? 

If it is so, then that statement does not represent the true picture. It simply says that more people with advanced degrees support BJP and not that support for BJP will rise in a group as its members improve their educational qualifications. Don’t interpret this to mean uneducated people are uninformed. People with low education levels benefit the most from AAPs educational policies in Delhi. They absolutely voted intelligently. I find it hilarious that the very same people saying ""Education doesn't come from a degree"" are the same people asking Modi for his degree. Doesn't seem like you understand the concept of intellectual consistency since you change it so that it suites your agenda. Classic left tactics really guys out there with P.hd degree voting BJP?? that doesn't make any sense unless this graph is given by the great godi media!",2020-02-13 10:33:38

I have some ideas to make this debate to the points. These ideas seem impossible but are not. Ofcourse even if we try to make it happen, they won't agree to it, because they cannot stand the truth.  

• Get Modi, Shah and Ajay Bisht in the same room with Ramachandra Guha, Azad, Sadaf Jafar, Kanhaiya, Dhruv Rathee, etc.  

• Exclude TV journalists. Bik gaye hai ye log.  

• Have a team from Altnews or some expert Google users who know how to search for stuff on the internet. To immediately fact check Modi, Shah and Ajay Bisht's statements and if it's false, prove it to them on the spot. If it's true, I'm sure we can find something to counter it. 

• Questions must be straight to the point, no bullshit. Questions must be pointed at places where it will hurt them.

Politics,Never Forget Never Forgive,366,f3mzi8,https://i.redd.it/zxylsr4bjtg41.jpg,51,,Ku_hu," Never Forget?

Should be more like ""Only remember on their Death Anniversary and get back to work from next day"".

Come on, Give me some downvotes for speaking the truth. RIP. All those who died are genuinely there to protect the rest of us from terrorism or worse.

That their death was used for election propaganda shouldn't affect how we feel for the matyrs. ""तुम्हारे शौर्य के गीत, कर्कश शोर में खोये नहीं,
गर्व इतना था कि हम देर तक रोये नहीं।"" भ्राता This post being downvoted show how many phoreners larp here Om shanti. I bow my head to all the martyrs this day and wish peace on the families of our fallen soldiers. 

P.S: I will never forget and forgive how BJP played politics with these martyrs. My head hangs in shame. *Shaheedo hum sharminda hai BJP abtak satta mai hai.* what happened to davinder? Noone has been made accountable for pulwama yet. kya khokla never forget never forgive hai ye RIP :( Betrayed and used while alive and after death by the self proclaimed nationalists. There are reports which says that IB warned the higher hierarchy about the possibility of such events. They also asked to have air transport, but still such thing happened.
All these things raises a single doubt, Was the attack allowed to happen? Because the government were under serious pressure regarding the economic condition of the nation and then this thing happened which completely threw people off the other issues, and thus helped BJP to shift the focus entirely on ""nationalism"" and how dangerous Pakistan is. 
PS- I love our Armed Forces and respect a lot but BJP is using then just for their propaganda. I am not sure if I believe the government and it’s narrative on Kashmir anymore Never forgive seems to be a bad idea Can we also take a few minutes to remember Kashmiri youth who are locked away by the army without any judicial process? They are being tortured, beaten, extorted and sodomized by army men. The bombers who attacked the CRPF convoy come from youth like them. This tragedy is the result of an immoral abuse of power by the Indian army and government on Kashmir. The bombers, who probably see themselves as Bhagat Singh for the Kashmiri people, need to be remembered too.  I have sympathy for the individual men who died, but none for the army. We all know who actually was reponsible for the Pulwama incident.",2020-02-14 12:39:19
Politics,Is it safe from police if I have to walk 5 km to a place then back home in the morning?,22,fq11zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fq11zk/is_it_safe_from_police_if_i_have_to_walk_5_km_to/,53,"I have to pick up my work laptop from my office otherwise I won't be able to do work for lockdown, and can face some consequences.

My office is about 5 km from home, is it safe if I go out on foot to collect it in the morning?

Update: I successfully reached office and collected my laptop. I was stopped once when going to office, I had to lie to them that I was going to a medical shop that is in the way.",mindlessCoder," bhai either you will need a strong reason or strong gaand! Carry a bag of vegetables with you. What's your location?

The best way to know is to enquire with the locals and nearby friends. Ok do this. Ask some friend who is near to office (say around 2km or so) to pickup your stuff and then you go and pickup from him. 
Or second option is use all internal roads and by lanes only to reach to your office and way back. Do venture on a main road and do this early in morning like 4-5 am.

Hopefully you will not encounter police and if you do please be polite and try to make them understand. No.

If I see you I will definitely report you to the police and may even video your beating and post it on the internet.

Call your employer and tell them I am threatening you. Contact the local police about your situation.

There might be chances that no one will pick up your call. So worst case scenario. Go out and look for a cop somewhere. And personally talk to them politely about the problem. Or maybe try having your boss or even an co worker talk to them on the call and explain the situation. And even try showing them your call history to prove that you actually called. why do you want to go on foot ? just take a cab or something It's not worth it man. Ask your company to deliver it to you, or find some other way closer home to do the work. What's the technical reason you need that particular laptop for your work? Give ‘pidge’ a try. It’s a delivery app for most things, from point A to Point B. I think they are functioning amidst this lockdown. I’ve used them before and they are reliable.

Politics,Government set to prioritise politics over economy - The Economist,71,en84kk,http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=1098890893&Country=India&topic=Economy&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=Economic+growth,4,,Sulh-i-kul," (The complete article)

**Despite the prolonged economic slowdown (real GDP grew by just 4.5% year on year in July-September), the government is unlikely to implement major economic reform. Instead of unpopular economic measures, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to maintain its focus on popular Hindu nationalist themes as it seeks to rebound from its poor performance in recent state elections. Fiscal constraints and price pressures will preclude fiscal and monetary stimulus in the short term. Meanwhile, emboldened opposition-controlled state governments are likely to obstruct the progress of major projects backed by the central government, further undermining the country's growth potential.**

The government has reacted defensively to the drumbeat of poor economic data in recent months, lashing out at critics and questioning the basis of some official reports. In response to criticism from prominent businesspeople over the state of the economy, the finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, warned that such rhetoric could harm India's national interest; she separately suggested in late November that India was incapable of experiencing a recession. Officials recently scrapped a government survey that showed an unprecedented decline in consumer spending between 2011‑12 and 2017‑18, arguing that the methodology was flawed.

The quality of official economic data has been criticised since 2015, when changes to GDP methodology allegedly overestimated growth during Narendra Modi's first term as prime minister (2014‑19) and underestimated it under the previous administration led by the Indian National Congress. In an attempt to bolster the credibility of official data, the government constituted a new Standing Committee on Statistics under the leadership of a widely respected former chief statistician, Pronab Sen, in December. The first committee meeting is due on January 6th.

**The government will prioritise Hindu nationalism over economic issues**

Rather than respond more robustly to the economic slowdown, Mr Modi and the BJP are likely to remain focused on divisive social issues that they believe will pay political dividends. Several far‑right groups, including some affiliated with the BJP, have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu country. Since winning re‑election in May 2019, the government has altered India's only Muslim-majority state by revoking Jammu and Kashmir's statehood and special status under the constitution. It also won a Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for a Hindu temple to be built on the site of a 16th‑century mosque destroyed by Hindu nationalists in 1992. New citizenship legislation, seen widely as a means of denying citizenship to Muslims who lack documentation, was enacted in December, sparking nationwide protests.

With Mr Modi strongly backing the citizenship measure in spite of the protests, the next major social measure on the government's agenda will probably be a uniform civil code. Such a measure would introduce a more progressive system of marriage and divorce, supplanting India's long‑standing practice of allowing Muslims to follow different practices. 

The measure would build on legislation enacted in July 2019 that criminalised the Muslim practice of instant divorce by triple *talaq*—a move welcomed by advocates of women's rights but opposed by some who saw it as part of a broader BJP campaign against Muslims. While the BJP promised to implement a uniform civil code in its 2019 general election manifesto, any such move would be subject to legal proceedings; the next hearing on the issue in the Delhi High Court is set for early March.

The most meaningful reforms that are likely to be implemented in the first half of 2020 are the long-planned amalgamation of dozens of different national labour laws into four distinct measures. However, the prevalence of other strict regulations and the absence of land reforms will continue to hold back manufacturing growth. For example, a new code on industrial relations, introduced before parliament in November, retains India's long-standing prohibition on layoffs without government permission at factories with 100 or more employees.

**Political changes at state level will hobble investor confidence**

While Mr Modi's hold over the national government remains unquestioned, the BJP has lost control of five state assemblies since late 2018, setting the stage for greater acrimony between the government and independently minded state legislatures. To the consternation of foreign and domestic investors in infrastructure and renewable energy, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, YS Jaganmohan Reddy, who secured his position in May by defeating a regional party formerly allied with the BJP, has refused to honour contracts signed by the previous state government.

Investors face even more risks in the state of Maharashtra, which the BJP lost control of in late November after an inconclusive election the previous month. The uneasy new anti‑BJP three‑way coalition government has pledged to ""review"" Mr Modi's Japanese-financed US$16bn Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train. The project is opposed by farmers, who stand to lose portions of their land. The future of a US$70bn refinery envisioned by Saudi Arabia's giant state oil company, Saudi Aramco, and a collection of Indian state-controlled oil companies is also uncertain; the new state government has dropped charges against protesters who forced the project to be relocated in 2018.

The BJP is unlikely to improve its performance significantly in the state elections due in 2020. The party lost control of the mining and steel-centric state of Jharkhand on December 23rd and faces an uphill battle to defeat the anti-corruption Aam Aadmi Party in elections in New Delhi scheduled for February 2020.

**Fiscal constraints preclude significant new stimulus**

The government announced a slew of fiscal stimulus measures in August and September in response to weak GDP data for April-June 2019. The measures included initiatives for ailing sectors of the economy, such as automotives, banking and housing. Notably, the government also gave companies the option to pay corporate tax at a lower rate of 22% (25.2%, including various surcharges), from 30% previously. This was backdated to the start of fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March), in order to spur private-sector activity. 

These measures will leave a large hole in government finances. The government will have little choice but to tolerate a level of fiscal slippage, but is unlikely to contribute further to the deficit with large new stimulus measures. With early preparation under way for the presentation in February of the annual budget for 2020/21, further fiscal measures are likely to be put on hold until then. Although reports suggest that the government is considering a moderate income tax cut (after September's corporate tax cut, which was intended to bolster manufacturing investment), the government has little scope to cut rates significantly in light of very slow growth in tax receipts. Fiscal and monetary policy constraints, coupled with an uncertain business environment in some states, will mean that the economy fails to reach its growth potential in this year and beyond. The stray dog caught up with the car but has no clue what to do next. EIU or the Economist Intelligence Unit has a grim view of India in the coming future owing to the policies of the BJP government

>Despite the prolonged economic slowdown (real GDP grew by just 4.5% year on year in July-September), the government is unlikely to implement major economic reform.

Politics,Rant - Dumbwits branding people as bigots who criticize the clapping,146,fng93i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fng93i/rant_dumbwits_branding_people_as_bigots_who/,27,"I saw a meme which made an analogy where Indians were heartened to see Italians clapping showing their solidarity and when we did it ourselves, we saw it as an embarrassment.

1. This whole idea of clapping on one side might help in boosting morale. However, it's just a distraction by the government which has no proper plan of action, lack of testing centres, kits, per capita hospital beds, economic measures for the low class people, etc.

2. Italians were clapping because they were enthralled by the service of medical professionals who are trying their best to contain the situation for the past 2 months. It is this government which cut down the health budget by 20 % when it came to power (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/india-slashes-health-budget-already-one-of-the-world-s-lowest/)
and has shown contempt in the past, asking us all to clap for their service. Ffs, we don't even have a data in a realist sense and the whole drill failed when lakhs of Indians took this shit to the streets and roads and defied the entire purpose of social distancing. 

3. I'm M20. I'm appalled to see friends from my same age group who mindlessly forward these Whatsapp texts which claim clapping to boost immunity and they themselves arguing it is an ""energy medicine"". Clearly these people don't have the scientific temperament, which even the Constitution requires us to do so.

4. One guy even told me to focus on what lies ahead instead of dwelling on the past when I cited how lethargic the government has been in the past with regard to healthcare sector and implementing testing measures in the wake of the virus. I'm just dumbfounded by this argument that I should not talk about what happened already. When all hells break loose, I'll send the same shit to him again.

5. Another bhakt asked me how am I helping in complaining about the government measures. He didn't reply back when I asked him how clapping would help.

I'm sorry about the long rant but I wanted to vent it all out since most of my friends are least interested in having a discussion/argument as it requires a brain or they are already brainwashed by the gimmicks of politicians.

https://medium.com/@covind_19/predictions-and-role-of-interventions-for-covid-19-outbreak-in-india-52903e2544e6",yazz276," Well said ! Unfortunately, many people don't even care to listen to these facts. They would rather blindly believe everything. I think the biggest difference is that the italians and spaniards did it on their accord. it was spontaneous and that is what made it beautiful

in india, it was asked by the government. many Indians did not even understand the purpose of the exercise, just followed the orders they got from their WhatsApp masters like sheep. even thanking others is a staged act in India My classmate is sharing on Facebook calling people who didn't clapped ""That's why we call you anti-nationals""

:P Does anyone find it disturbing that bollywood went all out crazy in endorsing the janta jagran/ janta curfew. From Aishwarya Rai to Karan Johar to Ayushman Khurana and many in between and around the ends, everyone put up videos of what looked like wedding celebrations or when India wins a cricket match against Pakistan. 
So many people that I personally know joined into the frenzy. My notion of intellectual Indians almost seems like an ideological dream and I'd like to believe I'm wrong. Banging utensils as a gesture that is celebrated with such fervor speaks more about the collective IQ and less about the intent behind it. Infact, the intent seemed pretty muddled for a lot of these celebrities. Italian balcony timepass is India’s national disaster policy. 

We are fucked as of this moment. ""Focus on what lies ahead instead of dwelling on the past"". I've heard it from other bhakts as well. These are the same people for whom every conversation ends with Mughals, British and/or Nehru. Okay i have a big problem with this whole discussion here.

1.) The clapping thing was not about appropriating doctors. It was result of whatsapp message about vibration killing viruses. People were using kitchenware everywhere you can see that in almost every video as it was directed in whatsapp message.  

*""22nd March is Amavasya(new moon) day, darkest day in a month. All virus, bacteria and evil forces have maximum potential and power on such days. 5 PM- clapping, shankh nada etc by 130 crore people at the same time will create so much vibrations that virus will lose all potency. Must for everyone""* 

2.) Who sent this message? RSS/BJP IT Cell. Why they did it? to subvert attention from govt.'s failure in tackling the problem.

3.) Why it was not about doctors? If modi really wanted to appreciate doctors he would have gave them exposure so that they could raise their voice and ask for must needed medical equipment.

4.)  Instead [Indian govt. promoted things like Homeopathy as solution for coronavirus](https://i.imgur.com/wc6q15S.jpg)

5.) Not only that [Their ministers and MLAs are claiming cowpiss and cowdung can cure coronavirus](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/cow-urine-dung-can-treat-coronavirus-says-assam-bjp-mla-1651708-2020-03-02) 

This is proof that they don't give a shit about indian public or doctors. They are only saving their own asses.

Edit : links. The problem is that the Bhakts understaood it as the usual Publicity stunts our beloved Supreme leader likes. Medical personnel  were the ones  who were gaining some respect, so as usual there was some piggybacking going on. 

No i  am not mistaken, as recent as last year, our supreme leader had claimed that doctors are  in cahoots with Pharma companies and take  international vacations on their dime.

They just went all in. 

I understand it was a feel good moment for people who were scared of the bleak outlook being presented to them. But this is a bit too much. Thanks for this. Scores of ""engineers"" and ""doctors"" in the country but ZERO scientific temperament. 

In other news. This Princeton doctor claims that the situation in India is already screwed. He claims we are stage3. **Lets hope he is wrong**. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrsXCxs2xg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrsXCxs2xg) The bhakts think that positivity will overcome anything. And they believe that supporting Modi and his PR stunts is positivity. 

Others, like you and me, believe that making govt accountable to the issues at large and questioning them on the measures taken is the most positive thing out there. 

There in lies the difference.

Bhakts need to understand that no other democratically elected leader has had it this easy. Modi just doesn't even do press conferences and takes questions. And the opposition is in a deep slumber. And when the few of us, as citizens question, the bhakts jump right at you. Modi is truly one lucky basterd. If some success happens, he jumps right in to take the credit and if failure happens, he always maintains social distance with the issues at large. All this in a democracy. It is the National Anthem thing all over again Everytime the Jumlebaaz brings a new gimmick , our society further divides in opinions.

When we are discussing about claps , nobody will ask about the difficulty faced by Doctors and health professionals. > One guy even told me to focus on what lies ahead instead of dwelling on the past   
>  
> how am I helping in complaining 

This is what pisses me off most when it comes to bhakts. The complete hypocrisy. I'm no Congress fan, but back in UPA days, did these people follow what they're saying now. They didn't complain at all and supported the government with zero comments at all times? 

Not to mention that despite coming back to government again, they're still complaining about Nehru-Gandhi all the damn time. And that's ignoring the insane ones who go on about Mughals and Islamic invasions. Organic Vs Orchestrated Some actually good arguments against why the clapping was useless.
I had been thinking that our government is just incompetent but apparently they're ignorant and selfish too. This country needs a big wake up call. It also goes the other way too: Dumbwits branding people as bhakts who clapped.",2020-03-23 16:02:24

That's fine

>he keeps on talking shit about muslims

This should be deal breaker in any friendship In my case, He/She is not a friend anymore. 98% of them are Bhakts. I stopped talking to my Father & Sister after they gave some senseless statements on what was happening in Delhi last night. I am an A grade asshole, I may never even talk to them again because I've seen enough of what's happening outside and it's against my conscience. It's as simple as that in my case.

Reason with them a couple of times, after that you need to pick a side.

Today you are just watching when he talks about Muslims, Tomorrow you will be watching when he burns a Muslim alive. I told the same thing a few months ago in a post that today you are just opposing why people shouldn't chant ""Jai Shri Ram"" but tomorrow they will just burn people alive while saying Jai Shri Ram, After 3 days Tabreez Mob lynching happened...

As they say in Germany,  ***If 10 people are sitting at a table being civil to 1 nazi, there are 11 nazis at the table, Period*** Nothing.

At this point...i have stopped giving two tugs about anything.

They want modi in 2024, let them have modi. They want sky high tax rates with no universal medical cover, in adequate hospital and medical support, piss poor law enforcement,  uncontrolled price rises, corporate bailouts at the cost of tax payers, declining economic opportunities, unusable infrastructure, declining global power and relevance...lets them have it.

They want NRC..let them have it. They want some of us and even themselves in camps because they never bothered to question the broken system and corrupt officials..let them have it.

They want a riot on the basis of religious divide but supporting vile spitting scum politicians...let them have it.

I've learned one thing in life. If people don't want to be saved, don't try to be their white knight. You can either cut him off as others are saying or you can try to change him. By cutting him off you can save yourself from the toxicity but he would still be a bhakt.

I don't know how to change that kind of person but you're in a position where you can. I'm trying to change the bhakts around me but didn't have any success yet.

By staying in contact you can also stop the spread of fake news.

In the end it's up to you, anyways I want to recommend some videos which give me hope that anyone can change:

What do you have exactly? A ""friendship"" with someone who's insensitive and bigoted. Can this be defined as a ""friendship"" in any way? [deleted]   

Reddit  is the worst place to ask for relationship advice, especially when politics is involved. Sure, if any of my friends began spouting hate speech, I may react in a certain way, but this person is not my friend, but yours. You  know him best, and you know best what could have led him to have these opinions. Frankly  it’s your call. If  you are having trouble deciding, talk to people who actually know both of you well. Are  there mutual friends whose advice you can rely on? That  would be the sensible step to take. Whatever  we advice you here, you are the one who will have to live with that choice. Every generation has to relearn that discretion is better part of the valor and keeping your political stance secret in a democracy is as much essential as much as keeping emergency funds safe and secret. Just cut off ties with such people whose consciousness is so bankrupt that despite being educated they are all falling into such BS. Up to you Sorry OP but get a new best friend. I don't suppose political differences should ever be allowed to step into and ruin carefully cultivated friendships. I don't know man, I try not to bring up politics in our conversation. Even if it's brought up I try to sway the conversation towards football or something like that. I cannot let my 10 years of friendship be jeopardized because of a cunt who doesn't give two fucks about our country. So yeah just don't bring it up. A friend from college invited me for his sister's wedding. I happened to stalk the groom and find out that he is a BJP supporter. 
Not going to the wedding.
Do your part. Has he called you Jayachand as yet? A really good friend of mine is also pro CAA, I was kind of disappointed to hear that, I just don't talk about it. His argument is that India should have the right to choose who's given citizenship and who doesn't, while not wrong, I asked why specifically muslims then? To which he said people ""think"" they're dangerous, doesn't matter if that's correct or not. He's not some bhakt either, he's a reasonable person for the most part. well I'd think less of him. i'd probably outgrow that friendship Give him a warning.

Slowly cut him out if he continues. I don't know mate, 'cause my whole family is full of bhakts... That's why I never participate in discussions, and if I do I would be made fun of despite presenting facts to support my view... But the problem is, I love them all, and I can't shut them down... So, the best thing I did was that I completely left discussing politics with my family, as you say, I cannot let politics ruin my relations with my family.... But in your case, since it's a friend, you should probably distance yourself from him.... Keep fighting the good fight. Be friendly and speak the language of love, but fight. Do not be hard, but be firm. Do not bend over, but clasp his shoulders and talk to him. Eventually, he will change.

Source : My friend used to be anti-Muslim, but he's not so anymore. Just don't engage in thoughtful conversations with him and be in limits. What does he say about Muslims? 

""Breed like rabbits""? Bangladesh and J&K are both muslim places. J&K has the lowest fertility rate (along with TN) and Bangladesh is considerably lower than a 80% Hindu majority country. UP and Bihar are twice worse off.

""Dirty people, horrible sanitation""? Bangladesh is objectively better.   

Tell him that he likes his own narrative because he's afraid of the truth, and he's just become a useful idiot that the politicians can program at will. 

I tried these on a couple of people. That has paused them ... at least they don't get haunt me any more. Politics is intertwined with values. The question should be, do you want to be friends with someone whos values of humanity are not the same as yours? I thought this post was in r/amitheasshole for a second. If you're not comfortable talking about how you feel with him then he isn't your friend. Remind him that I can kick his ass. If you care about him, embarrass and shame him publicly. Like, not by targeting him individually, but when he makes bigoted comments, make it clear in public that it is shameful that people can have those views. Let him know that you feel disgusted to even think that anyone can think that way. What this should do is automatically narrow the window on what he thinks are acceptable opinions to hold. It's called shifting the Overton window.

And if that doesn't work, just cut him off from your life, you'll be better off.",2020-02-26 14:16:02

That's fine. This being peddled as news, however, is the actual cringe. Shashi's sesquipedalianism is reaching vertiginous elevations. You keep on using fancy words. They will keep on forming governments. Which means, “I don’t understand”. Looks like a Pokemon's name Sorry, not even I know that one. Omg Sashi you charmer. Didn't he use this word in that Quint quiz? GRE people: write that shit down Hon. H. W. J. Ham, a member of the Georgia Legislature the humorist of the last campaign is the author [of a new word] and the word is ""snollygoster."" This he constantly applied to a certain class of politicians in Georgia. When in Atlanta a few days since Mr. Ham was asked to assign a definite meaning of the word. He replied: ""A snollygoster is one with an unquenchable thirst for office with neither the power to get it nor the ability to fill it."" According to this definition Georgia does not have a monopoly of [sic] the snollygoster.
—West Virginia School Journal, February 1893

Our first written evidence for snollygoster is from 1846. By the 1850s, it was used with some regularity in the American South to refer derogatorily and somewhat humorously to a politician. Etymologists posit that it might derive from the word snallygaster, which is used to describe a mythical creature from rural Maryland that is half reptile and half bird, and which purportedly preys on chickens and children. But there's a snag: snallygaster shows up in print much later than snollygoster does.

Snollygoster began to fade into obscurity, but got a boost when Harry S. Truman used it in a 1952 speech in Parkersburg, West Virginia, first denouncing Republican ""snollygosters"" and then quipping ""I wish some of these snollygosters would read the New Testament and perform accordingly."" When asked by the press corps what snollygoster meant, he said it referred to ""a man born out of wedlock."" Not so, cried various reporters:

Former President Truman may have been making a talknophical assumnacy when he said that snollygoster is what Southerners call a man born out of wedlock. Experts of the Dixie dialect rushed to their dictionaries .... They reported that a snollygoster can mean a number of things, including tadpoles and politicians. But they didn't find Truman's definition in their research.
    —Sarasota Herald-Tribune, 12 November 1953 Erudite *BaJaPa Bhagya Vidhaata plays in the background* Snollygoster is just a fancy word for shrewd,unprincipled politician . Even when Congress is getting decimated in front of his eyes , he would rather lick the boots of Gandhi family and show off his vocabulary . its getting a bit old isn't it *Shashi Tharoor farts*

Today in my school WhatsApp group someone shared the news about Saheen Bagh protesters being removed from  the protest site. And the response was unreal, they were so casual in commenting that they should have died due to corona virus and when one of my friend pointed out why there were people on street with thali. He was brigeded with  abuses. These were the same people I used to sit on same bench, we used to share the tiffins and now they are brainwashed in believing about Hindu rashtra and supreme leader. The level of hate is Insane.",ebu_hatela," If they protest that is non violent in nature, only 5 people present at a time with distance between them. It is against the lockdown but it sure is hurting no one. Thali banging nibbas are the real threat that are marching on the roads. And gained so many new ones online Not supporting Shaheen Bagh is NOT equal to support for Hindu Rashtra and Modi Well nobody should die but people doing the protest should understand the gravity of situation and should have paused the protest for timebeing.

Ita for their own good and for others good.

In this time of hour the highest priority is self quarantine rest all take second place. Well tbh that's difference in opinion.

Never let political opinions creep into friendship. If it does, then we will have to be ready to accept it. IQ and belief in right wing ideologies are inversely corelated. Think about it. If you were a dumb, weak, incel and wanted strength and sympathy, you would belive in a ""papa"" who would promise to take care of you and gave you instructions while you ganged up with the other incels and losers.

How would you show belonging and brotherhood constantly while nothing was happening in real life? By fighting imaginary enemies, telling tall tales, and believing each other's mighty bombast supported with hot air. 

They all crumble. The reasons they crumble will be different, some crumble because they didnt realize the group would one day see them as an enemy, others crumble when thy face a real challenge, and still bigger crumbles happen when together they get into deep shit and cant deliver on bombast. 

Stay cool. Watch from the sidelines, send them bigger and bigger bombast to believe in. Feed them. Look at the number of people drining cow urine now. They cant backtrack.

AAP knew that Kejriwal's popular image is their biggest strength and they used it perfectly. From a campaign centered around kejriwal (""lage raho kejriwal"") to posing this question to Delhi voters :**""kejriwal vs who""**.

Gone are the days when a party enjoys blind loyalty just because of past history. As the opposition recovers from 2019 drubbing at hands of modi, it seems that they have realised that any election campaign now requires a strong and popular leader to anchor their campaign.

All the elections in which bjp have been defeated in past few years have one thing in common, the opposition had a strong regional leader

* rajasthan : sachin pilot

* karnataka : siddaramiah (Congress got more votes than bjp)

* Odisha : naveen patnaik

* punjab : captain Amarinder Singh

* maharashtra : sharad pawar (Congress pretty much gave up in maharashtra and didn't even bother campaigning while sharad pawar was doing rallies even in heavy rains)

* Jharkhand : Hemant soren

* telangana : KCR

* Tamil nadu : stalin

* Andra pradesh : Jagan


Indian voters are smart. Political pandits think that the average voter is an idiot who can't distinguish between state and national elections.

In not even a single state election has bjp managed to even come close to their national vote share. People know that modi won't be resigning as PM and coming to their state. Moreover, state elections are fought on different issues and environment than national elections. This was clear in Delhi where while bjp was going on a rampage about shaheen bagh, 50% of the voters didn't even know about it, while the rest didn't understand or care ahout it.

A strong and visible face will always be more of a vote catcher than a faceless party",ParmanuMan," Popularity of a face in winning elections is well established.

Eg - Nehru, Indira, Vajpayee, Modi 
They were / are all charismatic leaders - their charisma got things done. 

In a country as diverse as India, that expects too much from it's government, only a strong, charismatic leader can get things done - only he / she can pacify protestors and factions of opposite views and wants.

India also has this tendency of 'Hero Worship' and Ambedkar warned against it. We worship our leaders like a God, pray to him to help us, and will not tolerate a word against him. No man can live up the expectations of Indian voters.

Everyone was so happy, there was people from all religions actually living together and not closed off to each other. This was what my grandfather used to say our home in Kashmir use to be too. People used to call me ""monay"" which means child everywhere and was so friendly. 

Everyone would ask me how to say ""__"" this in my language, they asked how big the mountains where I lived where, a natural inquisitiveness that made me feel really welcome.

The food was phenomenal, and I learned some breathing exercises when I went to a resort that I still use to this day to calm me down. Literally no one was caring too much about politics etc, (there were some protests or something going on too but I just assume its everywhere in India). 

Kerala is still among the top places i visited in the world for what I saw. everyone was malayalee/indian it was no I am a muslim first, I am a hindu first.  I think something about being on the coast gives everyone a relaxed feeling and a secure one that too. 

The seafood, and byriani were top notch. I think  hyderabadi byriani and kerala byriani are the best in the subcontinent.

I hope people don't boycott this place because its quite amazing place to see, you get to see thousand year old temples that are functioning, which was my other fav part too! Can someone ELI5 the boycott of Kerala? It's crazy how these people react, like ""war against Hindus"", ""not a destination for Hindus"", as if the state is offering only beef to the visitors. It's just one of the damn dishes they offer. Just got back from Kerala. Do they make earth's best Paranthas or what (well may be Amritsar gives them a run for their money). Don't get me started about the ghats, the backwaters, and the peoples. Absolute gold mines.

A word of advice to bhakts: Boycott your own stupidity, instead. And remember, travel during the monsoons. Kerala in Winter is too damn expensive. Don't be like me, I'm stupid. i'm not from india (despite being in this subreddit), can someone give me the context of this? This is so unfair man. Why should only Kerela have all the fun! Bhakts were getting angry just because a Kerala Tourism page on Twitter posted a recipe for eruchi (beef) fry on Sankranti. It wasn't posted by them to offend Hindus on purpose, it was just a coincidence, but the BJP supporters saw it as expressly an attack on them faith, when it wasn't. Some of them even said that they'd be ""forced to eat beef in Kerala"" if they visited, which certainly wouldn't be the case. I'm Mallu, and Hindu myself, so I'm just baffled about their reactions to this. Honestly, the only things keralites are super religious about is beef . I am a christian keralite who lives with a hindu guy who does not eat beef. I am respectful of his choice of lifestyle, and the same way he is respectful of my choice to eat whatever I want whenever I feel like. Imagine if he starts complaining that I need to stop eating beef because he does not like it. It is absolutely bonkers, not to mention that would make both of our lives really uncomfortable.  True harmony lies in respecting each others choice of lifestyle and accepting it. Gladly my friend is not  the kind of guy who gets butt hurt like every other Bhakts our there. 

By the way I have lots of complaint about Kerala, but am proud of the fact that all the religions coexist with each other so effortlessly in my state. I hope to see India following the path one day I’m foreign- why do people want to boycott Kerala? 
Actually if an Indian brother or sister would be so kind to explain the general political situation with the BJP at the moment that would be really cool. I get that’s probably a big ask but I see articles but don’t really have a context to understand . The truth is, in Kerala even Hindus eat beef. Seems North Indians want there version of Hinduism to work everywhere. Not gonna happen, now or ever.

Dravidians were in India long before any pseudo-Aryans even arrived. All are welcome just ""mind your own business "" that's our motto don't bother what others eat, wear,believe,by the time you are back in where ever you live try it there,sure there will be more happiness and peace around you Too hot and moist. UP people can't survive there anyway. Oh and then there's food issues too. This relates to assam more and they would be so happy about that that they could send some beautiful gifts to PM and HM. Many of us have probably boycotted UP without saying it out loud. It boomeranged on them. Guess I'm moving to Kerela. Boycott all of South India please. What ? There's beef in kerela? Time to book tickets 🤤🤤 Why worry about what people are eating as long as they don’t ask me to eat or stop eating also this is not good when someone says don’t eat Id you’re doing it because of being considerate in public like not eating when everyone fast for some religin thing then it is different busy forcing them to not eat something is not a good Do these cowtards know that beef is consumed in almost every other nation ? Do they plan to stay put in their cow-belt ??

On second thoughts, that is a good idea. They better stay in their small well. Lol  Kerala is hot this time of year so snowflake probably shouldn't visit I hope they boycott travel to Goa too....we love our beef and freedom here. India shud be electing officials that take them forward.. Not back to the 1800s True bhakt will scream Boycott Kerala and then run barefeet to Kerala screaming Mandir wahin banega if a temple issue arose there If the kingdom of Travencore ever decides to secede, count me in xD What is all this about? How are idiots allowed to say and encourage to prople to boycott a state because of their eating habits. If people say something about that makes sense like protesting against bills the government punishes them and when when people say things like these they do nothing. Why is my country led by stupids?
 Im 17 and in one year ill have the chance to vote I am really curious to know why these fanatics feel so insecure all of a sudden ? I am from Hyderabad, Telangana i have been visiting Kerala since 1994 and will keep on visiting. Kerala is the most wonderful state of India ""God's own country"". Temples are so clean and they follow strict rules and keep environment clean. Food is amazing and practice of drinking hot water is very good habit of keralites each and everyone should follow it. Yummy porotta I want that in Haryana as well.! Everyone is obsessed with Modi and Godi How the fuck you can boycott a state of your country , wouldn't it be like lower your GDP and all that ? This way is better than Raj Thackrey way In kerala no one links food with religion.

These two orgs are CANCER. Please boycott UP Context? I used to be supporter of Bjp during 2014 to 2018 but later i realized how barbaric they are, i have never heard about religious shit when I was in school, but now every where in india this shit at its peak , idk may be this shit was there in way before in North India but unfortunately its coming to even South India Why you guy's portraying that Hindus are against kerala? [removed] It’s one thing to stand up against the right wing Hindus in power right now.  It’s a whole another thing to aggressively defend the consumption of beef.

The world overall is moving away from meat and beef diets.  The climate is fucked by 2050.  Rapid deforestation is occurring to clear lands for cattle farming due to the desire for beef.  I fail to see how being so assertive about beef consumption is good for anyone. Christians and Muslims together outnumber Hindus in Kerala and they eat beef.  So Kerala has no problem with beef consumption. Majority is justified. I however find it funny when somebody worshipping Krishna (beloved God in Kerala) advocates beef eating. Gopaal (one who raises cow) Govind (one who looks for cow), are Krishna's name. Hindus do not count cow's meat in panch gavayam. If somebody is refraining from eating cow's meat, their feelings should be respected too. I am 12 and this is deep.",2020-01-18 01:30:27

The closest it got is ""voluntarily causing hurt"" which is much *much*  less in gravity than sexual abuse which has physical and devastating mental consequences and that's exactly what happened here.

We should consider ourselves very unfortunate that we don't have a sex-neutral definition of sexual abuse. I mean, *very*  unfortunate. This is not just about Caste Or religion.They couldn't charge him because there is a lack of proper definition of sexual abuse against men.Frankly speaking legally men can't be 'raped' or sexually abused in India by women or men,so the only charges can be of causing causing hurt. Isn't Congress running the show there? Why do we still not have proper justice with Congress at the helm in the state?

I find the grin on that officer’s face very disturbing. imagine the uproar across the country, if the same thing happened to an upper caste woman. I hope gender based violence agitates people for all all genders and not just women. can we just say ""raped"" at this point, because:

a) rape occurs where a sexual act is done without the consent of the party, which is what happened here

b) the word ""sodom"" has connotations to the LGBTQ community and more stigma is something that we absolutely do not need

c) it's called rape regardless of a person's gender",2020-02-23 12:49:14

Danke What harm a German guy could possibly have done by joining protests. By sending him back, This current Indian Govt gave an impression against the 'Gandhi Thing' they sell so cleverly overseas. 
Even though this can quite expose our current govts true intentions, it's unfortunate that in front of the international community, it is 'India'-the whole country, which will see a tainted image. Wait then please do something about apolitical Canada Kumar too Man ! I admire the Germans. 9 years ago, I had the audacity to say - I dont care about politics. I went to Germany for a Phd and postdoc and the amazing colleagues, primarily German taught me to be socially, environmentally and politically responsible. And not by preaching but leading by example. And the best thing is they don't even give it a thought, because for them this is business as usual. I should not generalize because my sample size was small and skewed, but I understand why it is still a sane voice when all other countries are dealing with their Trumps. They made me a better person. We all Indians are idiots to think that we have true freedom of speech/expression. Solidarity is the most virtuous form of tourism. This man is a hero. Acche Din /s There is a certain individual named TAREK FATAH who is a Pakistani expelled Canadian citizen , currently resident in India . This jerk involves in all kinds of political activities at the behest of BJP. Why he is not expelled yet?. Share this make this more popular Bhakts and sanghis are the biggest group of insecure losers and anti-nationals our country has ever seen He was my friend :( For everyone taking for granted laws prohibiting participating in a protest as a foreigner: it used to be illegal to sell salt without paying a tax to the British East India Company.

There is a difference between what is legal and what is *right*. This man did what is *right* On the bright side, German liberals will now know about Desi Nazis. IIT-M student here.. Allegedly the German Consulate was ready to provide legal advise to the student but he insisted he return to his country because he did not feel safe..
this was tweeted out by one of our alumnis.. and if anyone is wondering yes the whole administration of IIT-M is under BJP support. Lot of confusing details arising.

Some saying student visas prohibit you from participating in anti government protests but that certainly wasn't the case for me in the US.

So is it specific to countries?

It certainly does make sense though. Wahh modi ji wahh Never got the OCI card and don’t intend to until this xenophobic, misogynistic and anti national party is in power. They have started with the Muslims, will move to the Christians, then Sikhs and then the other smaller groups gradually till they have wiped out the 65% population and are left with the 35% Bhakti population. There is a civil war brewing. Hmm so a german non muslim became first person to be deported instead of a muslim.so the government is against dissent not any religion for them the particular community is just a scapegoat of a authoritarian rule. Any government that issues a curfew is a fascist government that's ripe for revolution. Imagine being so insecure you deport this guy for that poster How ironic Has more balls than some of our fellow Indians. Any government that cuts off the internet is a fascist government that's ripe for revolution. Good for him that he left, he wouldn't have to deal with the nonsense and stupidity of this govt anymore. Isn’t there a huge American NRI diaspora that supports the terrible twins Modi and shah? If German national  Danke SchonJakob is not allowed to talk about India how are these foreigners allowed to do so? Tarek Fatty, Maria Wirth, Francois Gutter, David Filth, CanadaKumar, TaslimaNasreen...

Just bcuz all the above toe the Sanghi line? This is IIT Madras. I wish DMK or some party do some dharna before the institute. Poor guy, its very sad that we treat him this way. Nazi Germany 2.0 coming soon. Any government that equates peaceful protest or assembly to crime is a fascist government that's ripe for revolution. Ah yes, a student was identified and singled out for deportation. Lets continue to spread his face around! Did he nazi that coming ? Its really unacceptable. Germany too has so many Indian exchange students, who can be sent back to India in response of this. But Indian government won't think of it and is taking these foolish steps. It is going to ruin country's reputation. They dont even realize that by suppressing any voice of dissent they are just proving that voice right shame on politicians for doing this like treating these students bunch of hooligans Man, how insecure have we become. Aren't you supposed to refrain from ""political"" activism when you are from another country? I think they have you write sign that during visa or immigration process. India- where its not okay to protest but its okay to poop in the streets India is getting *in* famous under modi's era. - Moronic bhakt [removed] While people keep comparing the current government to Nazis. People don’t realize the British Tory government was responsible for the death of 5 times more Indians in India.

Narrative is written by the victor, may be the problem is also that Germany lost the war and they couldn’t hide their crimes like the brits or Americans This will certainly ruffle some feathers with the German government. Germany is one of the last bastions where protest and freedom of speech are held sacrosanct. Neo-Nazis and skinheads routinely assemble in Berlin and protest and the police provide them protection (because everytime a great counter protest gets organized by anti-Nazis or the sane people).

This is a stupid act by this vengeful government. Under the ghar wapasi Yojana of Shri yogi ji government... Technically, in several countries, there are similar rules for foreigners from protesting against the Government. It's not a new thing. So there is nothing to be surprised here. To be fair, the authorities are following orders.

Foreigners in India are not supposed take part in (political) protests. Im lost(outta the loop),how can the indian immigration department send a german man back to germany? [removed] eeeeeerrriiiiikaaaaaaa Gosh this is shockingly direct. Ofc you're allowed to protest against the government of the country you're studying in as an immigrant. Not like there are any terms he signed while doing a procedure for a visa.

Like try protesting against the German government when you're there for studies and lmk if that turns out well 

Thought yall were a bit considerate but guess most of you are just brainwashed [removed] Ha ha... I am sure Feku and Taklu will not like that thought. They rather burn the country than lose power. He violated the terms of his visa.It makes sense he was deported. this dudes like 30, I don't think he was there Germans would know best the consequences of inaction. [removed] Not a good idea to do so under temp visa in any country...But that man has guts! Or probably he regretted living in India during the time 😄. As he should be. Regardless of his position on politics, these aren't his politics and he should stay out of protests. Imagine voluntarily going to India. Comparing Hitlers Nazi Germany to the current Indian situation(or anything) is the thing only idiots would do and he deserves to be sent back. Is there any reliable source for this news? Any document that the OP has access to share?

It’s interesting how people jump to conclusions without verifying the authenticity of the news. I am scared now. Will Germany retaliate and not allow me to study in Germany through DAAD? Forget about the Educational qualification..Is there a single person in this party having atleast comon sense.. 
Whole India is going to face the consequences. Awesome ... he can now push for the ones left out of CAA to be included as German citizens. He broke his visa law what you guys expect, it's mentioned in the constitution and visa forms. Good. What kind of dumb-ass goes to a foreign country and starts shit??? If he were to do that in Hong Kong, he might end up in a situation far worse than just being deported. He should count this as a learning lesson and move on. [removed] This is not something I can agree with, I mean come on comparing to that period, I know what we are fighting for and it’s very bad and all but that comparison is way too much. I remember reading somewhere, an individual in a Visa cannot take part in political demonstrations (not an Indian visa).. 
It's just surprising that Indian immigration were so quick to pick up and act on this. Finally some good freaking news Those who are getting sad on this news i request you all to go to Germany and protest peacefully  against German right wing party Alternative for Germany. 
Let me know what happens 😊 What’s the source of information? Yeh Tatkal deportation koi naya service chalu hua hai kua? [removed] Although this isn’t as serious as those times Why the hell would anyone want to become an exchange student in India? Go see France, Italy or Sweden, or use the networking opportunities in the US, the UK, Japan or China. Why India? Foreign national breaks visa rules.

Foreign national is deported.

More at 11 Honestly this is a better outcome than I expected when I started reading the post title. Why not change your name from r/India to r/anti-bjp , cause all you do is post left wing propaganda.(don't attack me in comment section I m a neutral guy using my freedom of speech to tell the truth) [removed] [deleted] ...to be honest, although i agree with everything on this sub Reddit, and the fact that modi gov is full of shit and caa and nrc is unconstitutional, 

I still believe this is a right thing, cos in a protest related to politics of a country should not be influenced by an outsider, i have seen his post here before, & i was anything but happy, but think about this , if the situation was different where a foreigner was supporting another side (or wrong side), it would influence alot of people not be a healthly thing,... & Also I m obviously over exaggerating things, but the last time foreigners interfered with our politcs was when the british raj happened,.... 

Although i m very thankful and love him for his support and also reminding us about the history and essence of what started nazism, deporting him was still a right thing and i m sure he knew about it too, which just makes him that much more of a hero,.. Nice He knew what was coming for him. You will be deported in other countries also Thats what you get to literally say “kisi aur ke fate  mai apni tang dal ke”",2019-12-24 11:10:46

They still won because they showed defiance.

No.

They did now and that's a victory..

Inch by inch. Is the chant by the crowd not covered in these comments? I know NRC but what is nrp? LOL, Leaving no space for government to counter. More power to them. If this was shown on tv all over india then it would be a great achievement and a tight slap on modi govt.
But star doesn't have this much guts.... Why do they need to politicize sport? It is one place where people with different can come together. Bringing in controversial issues into sport only increases the divide between people. Please , for the love of the game and sportsmanship , keep the bloody goddamn politics outside the stadium FOR F*CKS SAKE Does it make sense to express your political view towards a stadium full of people who are there to watch the first ever ODI match of the year between IND Vs AUS and the ones watching live all and well expecting a good game?

Politics,Lack of political leadership to this protest is dangerous,93,ebuika,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ebuika/lack_of_political_leadership_to_this_protest_is/,12,"As Gandhiji said, the masses do not have the strength to continue fighting for a long period of time. A dedicated team of volunteers are required to keep this fight going on. Which generally should be provided by political parties, but none of them are stepping up, the way they should and that makes me come to my point that eventually this protest will fizzle out without achieving its goal.",maverick_0512," Correct.

Parties are in a mess. Congress is too lethargic. Regional parties don't know what they want, saying one thing one day and another the next. Eg: JDU, AGP, Sena.

The Jamia crowd is largely Muslim. They are the ones who feel the most under attack, and its natural they want to protest. But its their protest that is the easiest for the Right to distort and spread the perception of being anti-national about - as for most BJP supporters, a Muslim crowd is anti national. Even Modi's statement about attire pointed people in that direction.

Also, when young people protest, without an experienced leadership, like at Jamia, it can easily be hijacked by goons. There are enough goons in all communities whose default way of protesting involves violence and arson. That will be forgiven when Hindu crowds do it but with Muslims, that is fodder for retaliation.

Let's hope the student organisers are sensible enough. If they emulate the violence ridden protest models popularised by political parties, it is a matter of time before there is an engineered backlash. Perhaps. Or maybe this *is* actually a way forward. There have been other ""leaderless"" protests in the past (Nirbhaya protests a few years ago, and the Hong Kong protests now).  This government has been able to target and suppress individuals so comprehensively that very few voices from politics are able to speak up in dissent, let alone from other spheres such as Bollywood or sports. I think immediate priority for these protests is to gather momentum. For leadership, these protests may have to wait till they produce their own breed of leaders. Prolly true. All the govt needs to do is to have another URI in the next 4.5 years and they will prolly win the elections again. Congress don't want to enter the protests until it's huge enough on its own fearing BJP would accuse congress of politicising the issue.

Congress has zero political intelligence and tons of infighting. It actually is very positive for the movement. If congress associates too much with the movement, it will give the bhakts ammo to attack the movement.

The protests should be organic. They should stay it this way. Reach out. When people realize everyone wants to participate, leaders will automatically form. This movement will not survive unless it is organic. Otherwise, the leaders we currently may look up to are people who can be easily mistrusted because of their roles in traditional politics.

Go find like-minded people and form local support groups. The networks will form. We have social media for now. Probably not for long. [deleted]",2019-12-17 19:10:05
Politics,Recently told Mom about inter-caste boyfriend and all hell hath broken loose,266,f76oov,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f76oov/recently_told_mom_about_intercaste_boyfriend_and/,116,"I'm 27yo female dating a 28yo male from a different caste (both UC Hindus, if it matters). I've had a great childhood, my parents have been very liberal about most things except the fact that I get married outside the community. That's all they've ever asked. As luck would have it, recently told my mother about my north-Indian boyfriend and she is shocked. Told me they will never accept this, especially my father, who she said might commit suicide. She hasn't even asked me questions about my boyfriend,  just says ""we don't accept this, you can do what you want"". She is not one for emotional reactions or drama (which I would honestly prefer at this point), just says ""No, not happening."" That's it, and she is supposed to be the more reasonable one. I managed to wheedle some information  that might matter to them in while talking, including how much he makes (""Don't run after money, not important!!"") and that his family is on-board (""then do what you want, we don't accept it, it will never happen!!""

Telling my father is going to be a whole other event. He cares even more deeply about the caste, can be counted on to always have an emotional reaction than a reasonable one. Logic almost always eludes him. I'm actually worried about his blood pressure when I break this to him. The hypocrisy is strong because I found out about his affair, but that has conveniently been forgotten. I don't want to use that as ammo but might have to if it gets out of hand.Also, my relatives are pieces of shit. My brother lives in the US and had a inter-caste marriage himself, but they use that for ""he has done this to us already, you can't do this as well. We'll become the laughing stock of the family"" My brother has done his bit by trying to talk to Mom and is supportive, but that's doesn't seem to be helping.

I'm successful, make decent money, am financially independent and am living in a separate apartment even with my parents in the same city because it's closer to work. My boyfriend is extremely smart and successful, makes more money than my parents can fathom and is genuinely, obviously the nicest guy. I'm convinced if they meet him, they will find no reason to fight this, but I'm sure they will refuse to meet him for a very long time.

My parents and I don't usually fight, unless we're discussing politics. The fact that my mother is being cold and the fear of telling my father is honestly too much to take and beginning to cause a strain on my interactions even with my boyfriend, who is doing everything he can to be present. Any advice/tips/stories appreciated. Thanks for reading!",spekshas," marry first, talk later. Screw the boomers. What's the problem? They said you can do what you want. If they want to persist with a passive-aggressive attitude, let them.

You live separately from them and they have no business meddling in your private life at this point of time. They can warn, admonish, disagree, refuse all they want, but they cannot compel.

Cut them off from your life, and watch them come back begging. This isn't about gloating over your parents, so accept them with the same love and warm affection you've had for them for so long when they decide that staying out of your life is worse than choosing who you may mate with. My friend 28F Punjabi from delhi had some similar story when she told her family about her 30M bangoli boyfriend 6 years ago, since then they gave her threat of sucide and her fathers health being detariorating and blaming her for everything health related issue... tourchering her mentally on every day... they even brought up.many arranged marriage proposals... 

now on 02 feb 2020 her parents gave in and they are happily married now.... 

In their case what helped is one of her uncle was supportive and boy's family was supportive... and she didn't give in.. she's was firm  on her point ... ""ok fine if you wont let me marry him that's ok ... then I am not going to marry anyone.."" and this she kept on going for many year and she was really paitent and her bf too... 

because at the end YOU are more important than your Cast... no matter what your parents will be saying to change your mind you stay at your point and try not to get yourself angry at the end you will marry that ""North Indian"" Fellow...

Btw I too had love marriage(inter religion, sikh-hindu) but mine was less eventful... Our parents were good sport about it... and advantage of this was we got to have 3 wedding ceremonies 1 hindu 1 sikh 1 for Marriage Certificate... 😂 [deleted] Good that you shared your story.Mine is also on similar lines. My GF is of the same caste (diff language/state), and 45 days elder to me.

When I told my parents about this, and my intentions to go ahead with her, they were completely against it. They almost disowned me, did not invite me home for dad's or mom's birthday, asked if I am being threatened by the girl etc, and basically mentally tortured me. **This put me into Secondary Depression, got on pills and therapy. Even this did not budge them.**

I pushed this for almost 2 years, and finally decided that I will go ahead with Court Marriage, and blocked my parents completely (phone, whatsapp etc). After 21 days of blocking, in Nov 22, 2019 they finally accepted her and her family.

We got engaged on 29th Jan, 2020 and our marriage is fixed on April 16, 2020.

**So key things to remember:**\- Do not give up

\- You and your partner both need to be in this, and need to be really strong.

\- Don't find shortcuts, just keep talking to them, tell them explicitly that you are not happy because of their reactions.

\- Try to find help from uncles/aunties/cousins whom you can trust (it can feel like there are none, but there are many, trust me on this!)

Good luck :) My father didn't talk to me for a good two month when I told him about my girlfriend from a whole different community, forget both being upper caste Hindus. 

A good chunk of modern Indian parents still can't fathom their child making decisions that doesn't agree with whatever their view is. The ""log kya kahenge"" attitude eats their head up more than their child's happiness.

Stand your ground and double down. Be respectful and let them express their dissent, but don't tear your relationship for them. If they truly care for your happiness over some stupid ass community member's opinion then they will slowly accept your relationship. It's a huge plus that you live away from them, so it'll be a boon of sorts when things get difficult.

Above all, tell them that you are 27, living and earning on your own and capable to take decisions for your own life now. If you eventually want arranged marriage over love, or stick to the latter, that will firstly be your call and then only theirs. And that the relatives can buzz off - if they are this bad, trust me you don't want your parents to have family conflicts with them outside of your relationship. 

With Indians though, the best way to do anything is to give it enough time. If they refuse to still accept despite you making maximum effort over a long enough time, you move on with your life. It's always a bigger loss for them.

Wishing you and your man all the joy in the world! Eh. You'll be fine.

It's emotional attyachar. 

Just give it some time. Slowly keep bringing him up in casual situation.

I feel it's more log kya kahenge than your mom being against it. >we don't accept this, you can do what you want

Why not ? They have accepted your brother. 1) Make sure that your boyfriend is worth it before you leave your parents.

2) Stay independent, both economically and emotionally at all times.

3) Never worry about what others are saying !

Good luck ! Damn. This makes me nervous when I think about telling my parents that I am in a live-in with a girl of complete opposite religion to mine (She is Christian I am Hindu) from a different country & 4 years elder to me! Like 0 of the factors are in my favour. UC Hindus ; lel Can't believe caste is still a big deal in India with so much exposure to Western media. Thought it would have died out by now except in rural/poor communities I am amazed by how awesome Indian parents are in emotional blackmail.

When I (a NRI at that time) told my parents that I'd marry someone of ""wrong religion"", they said ""If you do that, we will stop contact with you. Even if we die, you won't get to know about it"".

I responded with ""ok, if I die, you won't get to know either"".

By next call, they were back to normal. It was bluff. 

**It is not just that YOU need your parents, they NEED you too.** once you understand that dynamics, you can use it to your advantage. >that's all they've ever asked.

It's not a small thing to ask. It's me telling a person to forget their dreams and dedicate themselves to me and ""that's all i ask"". Obey them or not, it's your decision, but remember, you'll be the only one who has to live with the consequences of that decision and life is pretty long. If they really love you, if you end up happy they'll end up happy too, even if they get angry for a while. But if they do not, well.. You know what it means.

Also it's a parent's duty to raise the child **they've ** created. Parents using the fact that they fulfilled their duty as a bargaining chip aka ""we did so much for you, can't you do this one thing for us?"" makes me sick. You may love them, and they may love you, but this relationship is not healthy and you making a decision to please them will only result in resentment in the long term which might turn  out with you doing the same with your kid. Or worse, this may result in helplessness which is truly the worst thing in the world. Can someone help me too?

Muslim boy dating a hindu girl. We plan to get married too. I can convince my family but hers is something which we aren't sure of at all. 

How do I make it easier for everyone. We've been dating for a year now and our parents aren't aware of it. Are you from Andhra pradesh? Always make mistakes which you can own and can come terms to with. I would rather be pissed at myself for some shit which I have caused to myself rather than at someone who went off and decided what's right for me (even though with good intentions) as I'll be only one suffering and it won't even be my fault if things went south. Remember, only you are going to be living with yourself every second of your life and no one else. So make decisions keeping this in mind only if you think what I said is right. Hope I've helped you in some way at the very least. ""I'm successful, make decent money, am financially independent and am living in a separate apartment even with my parents in the same city because it's closer to work. My boyfriend is extremely smart and successful, makes more money than my parents can fathom and is genuinely, obviously the nicest guy. ""

eh you guys should just get hitched - all you need is two friends to witness the marriage,  and live a great life. They'll either come around or not. Long term it doesn't matter. Don't waste time trying to persuade unpersuadables.

And oh, congratulations, sister,  and wish you a long and prosperous married life! Mera bhai apni thai bandi se shadi karke yahin rehta hai koi kuch na ukhad paya. Don't worry sis you can do this. Idk why people are against intercaste, i mean, you'd be happy that's it's not inter religious Would Indian parents have a problem if their child marry a person  from another country. In this situation caste doesn't come into play, right? You should have totally told them that you were gay... Then they'd let you marry any guy you wanted 😏 My wife was in exact same situation when we decided to get married. But lucky for her, we were both living in a different country from her parents at the time she broke the news. There was quite a bit of drama and emotional blackmailing but the distance restricted how much she had to face her parents every day. The separation also helped to convince her parents that they might lose their daughter if they hold on to their pride.

My suggestion is, stick through it, don't fall for the emotional drama. It will take a toll on your emotional wellbeing, but it will be worth your time and effort in the long run. Some drama is expected :-) I completely understand this situation of yours. I see you as a mirror of me rn. My family too is similar to that of yours. I have similar fears that you have. I live in a constant fear that if I do like someone in the future, I might be in similar situation as yours.

Strength to you OP. That's what I can say. Pity on the Indian conservative culture, though! I hope your parents can learn to treat you like an adult. Mine still don’t but I listen to them and do what I feel is best for me. You have to choose between two options here if you really want to marry the guy:  
1) Push for it aggressively and just go against your parents consent and hope they come around after some time. Only go for this if you are in a rush to get married.  
2) If you are not in a rush to get married and can wait a few years, play it patently. Slowly wear them down. This by far is the most successful way to go ahead with these things IMO and I have seen this work. Reject every guy they show you. You have to make it look like they are forcing you to do something. If you try and push your boyfriend on them they will feel you are forcing them against their wishes and will cause more problems. Do not reveal the details about your boyfriend to your father till you see an opportune time, like if he explicitly asks you. Another way to reveal this to your father is through someone he trusts or respects in your community. Take that person in confidence, confide in them and ask them to help you out. If nothing else works, just wait. After a few years their anxiety of having an unmarried daughter will outweigh their prejudice of inter cast marriages. At this point they will be like anyone is fine as long as it is some one from the same religion. Do not introduce your boyfriend to your parents proactively or ask him to do anything. It should always seem to them that they are in control and things are happening as they would have wanted it, just with a small adjustment. This is not an easy road and will be extremely mentally taxing, so fasten your seatbelts for the ride and hope that you are the last generation that has to face this bullshit. Stay persistent.  Continue to keep the communication lines open - dont shut them off.  As someone else mentioned - keep bringing his reference up.  

Involve cousins, unkills, aunts and any relative who you think might help you case.  Keep away from relatives who might hurt your case.

If possible invite him to family functions like cousin's birthday etc.  Socialize.  Make it seem like a normal thing. 

On a lighter note: Take cue from Ajay Devgan in Drishyam - talk about him so much that people just get used to the idea of him. Well. Your mom has made her position clear. Only one thing left to do i.e. what you want to do. Dont overthink it. Our parents are not going to change overnight. Their social status matters to them more than the happiness of their own blood and they will have to suffer the consequences of being that way Hello Sister,
Find an aunty, uncle, relative who is elder than your parents and can understand your views.
They can help you to act as a bridge and sort this out.
Don't agree on this issue, this is for your personal life. If you want them to be totally onboard they won’t be in the beginning. I would advise setting up a meeting with your bf and mom in a public setting without letting her know he is coming. This way he can charm her and she can see you are good together. Usually that works. Your father may not come around. Be prepared to fund your own wedding. Just elope if you have to. Do not entertain for a second the bigotry and prejudices we have inherited from our ancestors.    

My next-door neighbour killed herself aged 25, apparently because she (a Brahmin) wasn't allowed to marry her boyfriend (a non-Brahmin Hindu). 
      

Her family hushed up the suicide and told us all that she had suddenly collapsed due to ""breathing difficulties"". My mother saw her in the morning of her death. She was perfectly healthy.    

No police investigated the scene (probably the dad's contacts with the local BJP MLA helped cover the case up). No proper funeral rituals were done for her, and her family doesn't even speak of her any more. 

She was someone I grew up with. We played together as children. We even went to the same school. And now, it is as if she never existed.    

To hell with the caste system. People defending it are real scum. Just relax and stay calm. I too come from an UC Hindu family and now happily married to a Muslim girl. There were issues from both houses (comparatively less on my side). My dad was hurt initially and although he is liberal he somewhat believed in keeping blood lines pure or whatever that shit means. I told him i'm not planning to have kids ever and hence his blood line will not be tarnished. But anyways i kept explaining to them calmly and in the end they were happy. It did help that i was completely independent and lived overseas.

In most experience parents personally have no qualms but are bothered about the infamous 'log kya kahengey'. Find a way to tackle this and you should be fine

But they all came on board and it took us almost 3 years of persuasion and negotiations and yes lies. But its all good in the end. The initial reaction will always be fierce but they will come to terms with it. 

I wish you all the best and my only suggestion is try for as long as you both can. And the relationship with my spouse soured as well because of her family not agreeing initially. However, say strong and remember why you both are together. Just go ahead ,this all suicide thing is a drama


The worse it can happen to you is that you might not have a fairy tale marriage.
.

If they are Brahmins from eastern UP, then maybe they will disown you forever Here's my two cents, I married a Muslim man (atheist) , and my parents told me they'd never accept it (screamed it infact through my Nokia cellphone). I've been married to him now for 5 yrs. The whole khandaan is happy. Give them time , it's sad that this is our reality, but the good thing is you've found someone to share your life with, hopefully your folks will see it that way too. Going by your story, I think you are in a "" good as long as you abide by our rules"" relationship with your parents. Universally, this type of relationships are not good for the incumbent's mental health since somebody has to suppress their personality quite frequently. I recommend severing ties with your parents (if it comes to that stage), if need be. Obviously, this recommendation is coming from the consideration that IC marriage is their only issue regarding your boyfriend. It's cold but I fear there's not a lot you can do here. This is every Indian love marriage ever. This caste thing sounds like you're from Andhra Pradesh/TG. Are you? >both UC Hindus 

What's this cancer? Very stupid advice but, don't marry. Make it a war of attrition. If I know anything about Indian parents, they will come down on your side instead of having an unmarried daughter. Its clear you have two options - Marry your love and live life on your terms (hoping that your parents accept you both somewhere down the line) Or submit to your parents and marry according to their wish thereby making everyone happy and content except for you, the guys who you marry, your BF and his eventual wife.... do it for the simple genetic diversity too much inbreeding has made our country weak although i doubt there would be much difference My boyfriend is 31, I am 29. Different castes, similar educational backgrounds, similar jobs. I have South Indian conservative parents, but I have always been the dominant voice in my house. I have also not lived with them since I was 17. I went to visit them in October of last year, I told them about my boyfriend and they just shut down. We talk on the phone all the time, but they just haven't brought it up. 

I think they are also scared of me getting angry. I have a bit of temper. I am also the main provider for my family. I have already told them I don't care about my extended family and the ""log kya kahenge"" thing never works on me. Right now, they are just stalling and hoping this goes away on it's own. 

My advice is do what you want, they will come around, they don't have much of a choice. What are they gonna do? Never see you again? Their other kid already lives in a different country. Based on what little information I have, this is my tentative take on this, subject to change based on additional information : You knew this about your parents and still got into a relationship with this guy. You have no choice but to stick with the guy, otherwise you will have played with his life and his feelings. Get someone of your extended family who is close to your parents on your side. UC Hindus 🤔 >My boyfriend is extremely smart and successful, makes more money than my parents can fathom

Problem with Indian women Someone I know is coming to meet me from another country. Could be an organ harvester, could be not.
Basically she is older, another race, another religion and a whole lot of other things.
I am dead either way. If you don't mind, it'd be interesting to know the castes of you and your boyfriend.",2020-02-21 13:45:37
Politics,Mom's (F58) boss keeps harrassing her to go to work even during the lockdown.. is there any action she can take?,139,frp4o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frp4o8/moms_f58_boss_keeps_harrassing_her_to_go_to_work/,31,"So my mom who is old and diabetic,( the worst combination to have during this pandemic), lives just 2km away from her office.  Her boss, who is much younger and healthier, keeps calling her, even during the lockdown, asking her to go and finish files that have been left. My mom has been politely refusing her since the lockdown began, but now she's becoming more and more persistent with her threats: like she'll complaint to the officers above, or use some other tactic...

Eventhough there is no official notice for her to go and do her duty on the office.  She's still forcing my mom to go and do the files..

Is there anything I can do?
 She works in railways and hasn't been officially asked to go to work.
Anywhere I can complaint about this, or any suggestion would be helpful!!

EDIT: Thanks for the overwhelming support guys!! I've told mom to try many of the things you guys suggested, she'll ask her to give an official letter first and incase she still forces her to go unofficially, then I told her to use, u/marrmalayde 's idea, she agreed!!

Thanks a lot guys!!, This was truly heart warming !! Also thanks from mom!!! She was happy and surprised to see this many people helping!!",sicksikh2," Ask your mother to lie a bit if she can. She can say that while she was on the way to the office, she was stopped by the cops. They wouldn’t let her go and were about to arrest her, that’s when she gave them the boss’s name and phone no asking them to verify from the boss herself. They took the details and let your mom go but they have threatened legal action against the boss. A repository of lockdown offenders is being built in the city and they will be named and shamed with an FIR and their property auctioned to fund coronavirus healthcare. 

Ask your mom to tell her boss that she may expect a call from the police anytime. Hi OP

 So ask your mom to do this next time her boss calls. Ask boss to send her the order in written paper signed and emailed on office letter head. As you mentioned she works for railways I am 100% sure she won't give your mom anything in written. And as long as the word are verbal aunty can ignore it if she feels like doing so

 And if she gives it in written because she is that stupid. Then just forward the letter with your mom's reply on file to seniors GM, district collector and her boss ka immediate boss explaining age and risk of corona. Tip the police. Unless the 'work' falls under essential services, report it to the police. I don't think higher ups will take her boss's side. Does your mom have union membership? Communicate through text and email. She should Write a diplomatic email, without pointing fingers at her boss, apologising that she can't come to work as she had the highest risk to the Corona virus, because of diabetes and old age. This should be CC'd to her boss. 

This will have two effects: 1) her boss might back off 2) in case your mom goes the office, and does get Corona virus, then you'll have written proof and you can hold her boss liable. Cough loudly while on the phone Don't take her calls. Get something in writing. If she calls, send text saying sorry I have a sore throat and bad cough cannot talk please text me.

Or just say sorry I have cough and fever need to quarantine for 2 weeks in case I have covid19, do not want to spread it to anyone. End of story. Just ignore what the boss says. Put in your moms leaves. She might have accumulated a lot of leaves she put them in. Since she is in railways nobody can kick her from the job. Might deduct one or two increments and thats all. Even that is in worse case scnerio. Which state? Ask her to put it in writing that she is concerned about health and safety and thats why she cannot come to office. Legally, they cannot force her to come to office during the lockdown an dif they do, they are liable. However, consult a labour law person. Karma",2020-03-30 19:32:57

Obviously Scindia got a Rajya Sabha seat and will most probably be gifted a ministerial berth. However, for this, he had to earn it and bring down the Congress government. 

The 22 MLAs could not have been made ministers in the new BJP government - they first have to take care of their own MLAs and secondly, these 22 have resigned anyway. So for their resignation, each of them has been bribed 30-50 crores. That puts the total to almost 1000 crores. This money is going to come from you and me and all because BJP wants power either through winning elections or through bribery.",paul-tyson-braff-cat," Hope has left the chat. BC how it is common knowledge that MPs and MLAs are bribed Rs 30+Cr per transaction? These people are then elected again by a population who would not even earn that much in their entire fucking lifetime. How can they route tax money to bribe MLAs? ELI5 please I don't believe this 35-50 caror. Must be higher. Same thing happened after Harayana elections. JJP MLAs were bribed 10cr each in a Gurgaon hotel. Karnataka says hi FYI... If the resigned MLAs are being paid 30-50 crores, the damage has already been done. The money has already come out of the system and gone into each MLA's pocket. MLAs don't resign with promise of money in future. Besides horse trading is as old as politics. There is very little the people can do about it. It is not the mistake of any party ( BJP/Congress), it the mistake of people who elect candidates with weak morals. 

Congress in their rule has been more ruthless while bringing down the govt. [deleted] Put some sources or all you're doing is speculation and rumor mongering.

Even if the whatsapp messages turn out to be fake, ABVP's claim is hardly believable that the left attacked them.
If it was the left, why didn't the police intervene like they did in jamia to beat up innocents students in library? In fact, the police would have been more aggressive in its action if it were abvp who was the victim as Mota bhai has his blessings on them. Why would the jnsu president get injured. Why did the VC vanish? Why did the Jnu administration take 2 hours to give an official statement. Wtf is happening to our country!!!! Fuck this government. Everyone who has refused to go against this regime is an enabler of fascism. Even today some people here were defending Kohli when he refused to speak against this government. 

This is a result of that. Democracy doesn't die in one night. It is taken away slowly. If you don't speak up today, there won't be anyone to speak up for in the future. [removed] One of the ABVP members from the recent attacks is likely identified. Similar stories were posted by her college mates.

As a concerned citizen of India, I request you to take suo motu cognizance of the attack on students and teachers of JNU on 5th January 2020 and direct the Delhi Police to safeguard the life and dignity of the students, staff, and teachers. 
Thanks. First attack students with murderous intent and then trend #LeftistAttackJNU, classic bhadwa move by ABVP Modi is a threat to India. A bigger threat than Pakistan.

MMS warned us that Modi will be disaster, but voters didn't believe him. What the fuck is happening to our country man! This is what happens when India elects a Gunda pm and his gang. I don't generally advocate violence but these madarchod ABVP goons if get their heads smashed I won't give two shits. Fucking inbred cowards. Just reached Shaheen Bagh, the crowd is huge, I doubt they will dare to attack here. More people are reaching as they hear of violence at JNU. Get this to r/all This is so terrible. What I am afraid of is that the TV channels will parade this violence as somehow proportionate and justified actions of the Government just trying to ""protect public property."" In fact, they are attacking the public itself. This is nightmarish. I cannot imagine the plight of those poor students. I’m feeling so helpless right now. Can't believe this is happening in our country. Disheartening. I am sure bhakts would be happy at this.

However, event like this will push fence sitters (or aloof people) into anti-BJP bandwagon.

BJP leaders are turning this into another issue saying Left students unions blocked registration and the goondas were left urban naxals. Also dragged in Jamia into this including Meenakshi Lekhi specifically said Jamia specifically so as to include ""Muslims"" to complete the ""anti-nationals"" tukde tukde gang. 
Somehow RSS was okay using students during emergency for protest in 1970s but now seems so much loving education and worried about students future. When you have extremists ruling the country, this shit happens a lot. I'm actually really really interested to know how this will be defended by the Bhakts. Till now I have:

1. "" JNU ko yahi bhasha samajh aati hai ""
2. "" See, the Left beat me up""
3. "" Shut Down JNU "" (because you attacked them? wtf)

and the most outrageous one of all -- ""It's self orchestrated"" (Yep, opened my own skull because why not.) But I don't understand what advantage would BJP get with this attack? Holy fucking love of God. I have no idea how high my heart beats went when I was watching that. Is any international media covering this? Super power 2020 Ok so can anyone explain what's Twitter on about? There's blaming the left for this attack, I don't understand Chaddis/bhakts are behind these attacks. Didn't BJP say that it is time to punish the tukde tukde gang? 

All protestors should carry something with them with which they can defend themselves. Protest tomorrow near Meenakshi towers. 4pm. Guys from Hyderabad show up pls! Soon a Paramilitary will be formed in India and there will be a civil war, if such stuff keeps going on.

It will comprise of
Anti cab
Students
Victims of police massacres
Revenge seekers of gujrat model
Victims of injustice system

A deathsquad will unravel itself against these low iq polticians. madarchods. PM kapdo se pehchano na kaun hai ..... fuck this Gujrati Duo and their supporters. Will they do anything or will there only be ""kadi ninda"" Pro BJP people be like....meh who cares ...Anti-national University. Definitely they must have done this so Modi gets blamed.

I fear this is the reason they are doing this. Because majority is with Modi so they can get away with anything. And even if culprits are found from BJP, their supporters are gonna say ""Tukde Tukde gang college deserves what they get."" > Send emails to Chief Justice of India to take suo moto notice and summon Commissioner of police and direct police to protect life and liberty of students staff and teachers .

Would it actually matter? Sometimes I wonder is there any hope left for this country? I fear in near future this country will be divided into pieces again. Why Indians are always like this? They don't even bother to change themselves. Majority of the population are selfish and they don't think about their country's future. And yet these people say others anti national. Sigh. If we had a Second Amendment like thing in our dumb Constitution, imagine what would have happened. Dark day for Indian education and democracy. ABVP goons and terrorists are doing their work and Delhi Police is standing still. Delhi Police is always ready to thrash JNU and Jamia Milia students but when it comes to students' safety and taking action against ABVP goons they are inactive. This is the condition of law in this country. As a hindu male from upper caste I hate this government. What worries me is that Modi is going to win another term. Today is a sad in India democracy. how do we make this hit reddit front page?, i really want the world to look at the shit we are in. ABVP is behind the attack, it is the BJP students extremist group and police let them do things when Shah asked people in his rally if they wanted a government that sponsored riots ... he wasnt asking , he was laying bare his gambit. 

There are already conspiracy theories being forwarded by bhakt handles that aap was behind the attacks. 

smh. RSS and ABVP are terrorist organizations. Delhi is burning coz of 2 eunuchs Check this WhatsApp thread. Nuff said!

[https://i.imgur.com/CCRuD0j.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/CCRuD0j.jpg) What the fuck? Is there any reports conforming why the ABVP and JNU security had assaulted these students? Tweet and retweet with #TerrorAttackOnJNU. That will get more attention from media and neutrals. And make it harder for anyone to defend the goons.

There can be no denying this was attack from Indian terrorists. They came to suppress the voice and spread fear. They attacked innocent people. Without any provocation or notice. I am fron Hyderabad and this shit is so surprising. What are the students doing. They should lock the fucking gates and gang up on these masked bitches. I don't know, maybe ram a car into them. Fucking break their legs ASAP. A phone number in the whatsapp group shared by barkha dutt is showing INC crowdfunding number? How legit is this? Is it actual INC's number or could it be changed by someone in this one hour? behenchod is desh mein chal kya rha hai The right will blame the left the left will blame the right. 
We won’t know who were these goons affiliated to. And in the national capital where the police can call for backup force within minutes how the fuck did this barbarism happened??

The govt controls delhi police, will this investigation ever see a result, a just trial? 

Those fuckers. 

Doing such a thing right at the heart kf national capital needs balls of steel and wothout govt backing it was not possible ever. Eye for an eye seems the answer in india. Putting a bullet in these idiot's heads seems the perfect solution. These people won't stop, until they are dead. > **Delhi Police Sources:** FIR registered in connection with violence in Jawahar Lal University yesterday. 23 students who were admitted to hospital have been discharged. 

https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1214043387625492480 Whatsapp is the biggest echo chamber of bhakts and believe me, limiting the fake news would slowly have effect on boomers to start questioning things. Instead of debating and rupturing family bonds, think outside the box. Think you need to save them from the poison without them knowing you are doing it. Start with muting whatsapp groups and archive it. Secretly join them in moderate groups and you will see positive effect.

Limit zee, republic and hate mongering channels by disrupting the nonstop flow, just like we get annoyed from youtube buffering and switch to other video. Make it look technical and they will switch to better channels. 

This is fight for our future, not theirs. Consider this part of your job, struggle. Our mission is to flip their votes which is possible by working on their mindset. This is a fight for ours and nation's survival. Post is getting downvoted heavily. Sanghis shitting their chaddis. Alright this is it. I'm fucking done. We ain't winning this without violence. If that's the path, so be it.

There are times when Non-violence works and Violence works. This is fucking fallout of what that tadipaar madarchod taklu has said today. He gives incediary speeches about how these so called tukde tukde gang is leeching off our country. For violence to get easier you first have to demonize your victims. I don't understand how a party which has won two general elections can plan something so boneheaded which has zero chance of succeeding in the era of camera phones and social media. If it was indeed them who planned this then it was bound to back fire 100% of the times. 

Which makes me entertain the alternate theory that BJP isn't behind this, I mean the last thing they would want is increase nationwide mobilization against them, and this is exactly this attack would do. Hey everyone, first time I'm hearing about any of this going down in India, someone give me the quick version? Who did this? And why? Is there no CCTV coverage inside the college ? Thats what superpowers do tho Can anybody explain this? AMIT SHAH MODI BHAGAO DESH BACHAO! Protest tip:

If you are being beaten up or man-handled AND you or others are recording the goons attacking you, just say: ""ABVP/RSS/BJP/BD (or whoever it is) goons don't beat us, don't attack us""

Now understand the logic behind this, say, if ABVP goons and the likes are the ones who are getting beaten up (like they are claiming), they should shout ""Students/leftists/whatever don't beat us"" but they aren't, because that's not the reality. It's rather the opposite. So when the innocent students who are actually been beaten up by ABVP goons don't shout out the line, the general brainless public doesn't understand who is who and they get swayed by the propaganda that the leftists are beating up the abvp people. 

ABVP goons won't say 'abvp goons don't beat us' because that will put them in bad light. So the students are at an advantage here. Please don't spread rumors without knowing the actual identity of those goons. It might be the work of some terrorist group who could try to widen the gulf between us by using the sentiments of protestors. For god sake, please maintain peace and calm. It will only lead to more violence and injuries. Stay united but don't lose your patience. Disturbing if true. But let's not panic or spread hysteria. Guys try thinking rationally before reacting. What we see here is merely a couple of Twitter videos. We will have to wait till media covers these happenings more thoroughly and let the truth emerge. Until then beware and stay vigilant and most importantly. In this atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion and divide. Stay smart. One number leaked by barkha dutt of the planner or attacker turned out to be congress Everyone has a phone with a video camera but they have no idea how to shoot a watchable video. Be it left or right why are they not allowing students to register for exams. [deleted] I wouldn’t be surprised if the Congress party is behind this.

I think what you are describing as solution is the problem itself. People are reading more than ever. You may say WhatsApp messages are not literature but lot of bloggers and podcasters have gone on to write best selling books. Also, there is no process which makes a book more factual than a WhatsApp message.

I believe the solution is to reason more. People are getting polarized by reading stuff from one side and completely believing it. The only way to break from the bubble is to reason. Take a pause from reading and reason whether what you read makes any sense or not.

Politics,US Democratic Presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard has ties to the RSS,183,fcarrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fcarrw/us_democratic_presidential_hopeful_tulsi_gabbard/,67,"While it's unlikely she will win, Tulsi Gabbard has unmistakable ties to the RSS. This is worrying because she has still not dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nominee, even though she is polling lower than all the others. While it's safe to say she will never win this US presidential election, it's still worrisome that someone with such ties to the RSS has reached such a position. 

NRIs living in the states appear to support her, probably because her name is Tulsi and she loves Modi. In fact Tulsi is not Indian or of Indian origin, as she clarified herself on Twitter in October 2012. She was  born into a family of American Samoan ancestry (Hawaiian) and converted to Hinduism later in life. 

Some interesting articles about her Hindutva leanings:

Tulsi has spoken at several RSS events and allegedly receives funding from them, but she clams up every time she is questioned about it. Time to make this public knowledge and ensure she never runs for presidential office again.",inkyfingers7719," Tulsis take on American foreign policy is refreshing. But yes the bottom line is that she is indeed a Sanghi. She was asked about the post-godhra riots and her answer was telling. RSS is only filled with con artist and scammers Tulsi is the same The Alt Right seems to like her as well, from what I remember. That's never a good look. [deleted] ‘Murican here- there’s honestly nothing to worry about with regards to Tulsi, she’s one of the only Democratic House members to vote ‘present’ in Trump’s impeachment trial instead of voting to impeach. We hate her, she is a blight on this country, and she is doing absolutely terribly in the polls. Bernie Sanders is the Democratic frontrunner.

Edit: Also Indian American citizens make up 2% of the populace. And as one of them, I can assure you that not all of them condone RSS, BJP, or Modi. I would've still rooted for her if her immigration policies were beneficial to India or Indians in some way, but apparently, no. Though you should've already known that Pieter is barely regarded high in journalists circles, lemme go through his stuff again.

The Caravan article is behind paywall, please post full text. This is cited as source many times in his every piece when ever he gives actual links to RSS.

The Quint article is by same author, and instead of providing proof of links, he is again clutching at straws. Not criticizing the RSS doesn't mean she is RSS, by this logic Kejriwal is supporter of RSS backed violence in Delhi.

Rest whole article is just roaming around the point making useless conclusions. And shit like ""she used a Sanskrit word, vhp also uses the Sanskrit word, so she's clearly RSS"" when conveniently omits the dact that many from  MMS to Pranav Da have used a common Sanskrit word.

Also, the author seems very, very angry about her tussle with Hillary for some reason, despite it's clearly Hillary in the wrong for making baseless accusations against some of her fellow dems to favor her friends.

Intercept is, well, Intercept. No source, no facts, just how they like it.

That said, please post the Caravan article which provides source of the RSS backing & funding as Pieter claims. Hopeful my ass. She has dropped out of the race. Many of America's new far leftists are tied to terrorists all around the world. Its scary they might be part of the administration somehow if Bernie wins..  
  
Tulsi - RSS  
Ilhan Omar - Erdogan  
Talib - Hamas Don't buy into smear campaigns. All the above articles are ill researched. Instead of asking questions, they accuse, that should be a red flag. Tulsi might have been the only Democrat who had a chance to beat Trump in 2020.

I have heard hear speeches and don't think she has anything to do with RSS. 
She is very much anti establishment and the liberal media (CNN,  MSNBC and others) hate her. The main reason for them hating her is the fact that she was anti war, which is why the liberal media in the US hates her. They have also tied her to Russians as well. Don't think she is related to RSS,  India is the biggest untapped market for developed countries and if you want to grow you will need good relations with India that's why she must have said good things about her. 
As far connections to RSS are considered, i don't think it out of the world to see a Hindu organization be happy of the fact that a Hindu is doing so good in US politics. Where is the actual source linking Tulsi to RSS? These are opinion pieces. Reported for misleading and false content.",2020-03-02 19:33:17

Sadly, the Congress doesn't seem able to get out of the ICU. 

On one hand, Many states have already passed anti-CAA/NPR acts. On the other hand, BJP already seems to be making a star of Yogi. 

BJP will put forward a strong ""personality""/""face"" - this cannot be beat by an amorphous coalition - they too will need people to lead from the front, not decide leaders after post-election squabbling. 

But at the national level, the only secular hope is a multi-party coalition. Who is the best PM and deputy-PM (yes, I think this job will need to be reactivated to keep all coalition partners happy) choices from the current secular parties that could come together to form a national govt? 



I have nothing against RaGa, but for the foreseeable future I will vote against whoever makes him as their PM candidate (go ahead call me hypocritical I don't care).",yogesch," Bhai entrance exam lagao. Interview karwao.  And find someone who will listen to a group of experts on issues. Chai wale nahin chalenge. Maybe a federal front coalition could work, with states being accorded more rights over taxation and other matters while keeping the BJP on its toes with a patriotic flavour to the movement.  

All you need in the FPTP system is to prevent the opposition parties from dividing the non-BJP votes by cooperating at the seat level.

Fwiw, I don’t think any politician can lead this decisively without significant buy-in and compromise from the Congress. That would mean the Congress would have to let go of the top leadership role while avoiding the impression of calling the shots behind the scenes. Difficult but doable, taking cue from Maharashtra? Kejri will get my vote, you can tell from all the brainwashing that is going on by the bjp it cells and Bakths, to tarnish his image, that the psycho pants consider him to be the biggest threat.  

Indians are too dumb though, they will just vote for modi till time ends coz he “tries” and when he makes mistakes, he says “sorry”. What a man! KTR, IT Minister of Telengana.
He is exposed to the corporate culture, and an excellent administrator. Navin patnaik I think we need a 1977 Janata Party like merger, with all anti-BJP parties merging together. In such a scenario, put Vijayan as your PM candidate. Paint HDI of Kerala as an alternative picture to the oft repeated Modi development. For good measure, and balance of geographical figures, put Sachin Pilot as the Deputy PM face. Young enough, a North Indian figure and surely some administrative experience. Very idealistic, but I think this duo can actually work. Any competent south Indian mass leader with administrative capabilities. 

Pinarayi Vijayan gets my vote of confidence. Kajriwal. He's not perfect but he's 100 times better than modi. Yes he does politics too but he is not an evil mass murderer. Uddhav Thackeray - why, you ask? Not just because he came across well during this crisis & shown his leadership skills. 

But also because in the atmosphere BJP created, you need a man who is pro Hindus yet not RSS type Hindutva I dont see any political figure in the opposition who looks like a candidate. When they are able to dislodge the BJP, they should go back to the MMS-Sonia model. Politicians taking care of politics and administrators governing the country. India likes strongmen like Modi though. So they will call this guy/gal remote controlled. But this coalition can just stick together, not give daily threats of breaking up and get behind the PM, you never know, they could just pull this rabbit out of the hat. I am surprised no one mentioned CBN yet. If no RaGa then you need a very solid veteran. Maybe Sharad Pawar from NCP. Or Chindambaram is also a good option. Lord Simon",2020-03-31 15:06:32

Now BJP got Scindia's backdoor. If he feels neglected in INC, ideally he should have formed his own party (like Sharad Pawar) but him joining a party on the other side of spectrum projects him more like an opportunist. Of course. The thing about making our democracy so....cynical, a task done as much by the people as the politicians (because politicians did not come out of the aether, and are elected and supported by the people), is that every system in human history has relied on the honour of its participants to function. 

Right now, honour in politicians is treated as a joke. So why are we surprised when we hear the punchline? Scindia's political career is effectively over. congress itself is to be blamed for this.They kept neglecting him,  snubbing him  for rajya sabha was the final nail in the coffin.

In rajasthan, they atleast gave pilot vice cm post.This guy got nothing , he was displeased from the start.Surely he must have told his problems to gandhis , nothing was done by the leadership.

Congress is full of arrogant pricks who are in the party for their self interests, no fixed ideology in the party. Gandhis are failure as a leadership , internal politics is rife in this party.


Everyone has been predicting this government's downfall since it has been formed.it was only a matter of time before it happened. Eight months later, opens up his back door for the BJP... When it comes to Indian politics, ""Hypocrisy ki koi seema nhi hoti"". Scindia is talking like Poonam Pandey. I guess somebody liked the backdoor afterall. I know this guy, he used to sit with Rahul Gandhi in Parliament.

Politics,We need to extend support and solidarity to minorities and marginalized sections of society rather than vilify them if we want them to keep coming forward to report coronavirus symptoms,54,fv6zuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv6zuc/we_need_to_extend_support_and_solidarity_to/,11,"We have all seen how Muslims are being vilified after [a Muslim congregation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52147260) sparked a new wave of COVID-19 cases. 
[List of names with addresses and mobile phone numbers](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-activists-voice-privacy-concerns-over-leak-of-unverified-patients-list-on-social-media/article31236944.ece) of people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi are circulating on social media. Given the communal narrative being spread against them, this makes them extremely vulnerable to community backlash and hate crime.

A BJP Health Minister himself [revealed the names, age and locality of Nizamuddin returnees](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/this-is-why-the-names-of-the-nizamuddin-returnees-who-tested-covid-19-positive-in-assam-were-revealed) who tested positive in his state in an official press conference. He then asked the other Jamaat attendees to also come forward to face the same ""treatment"". Any guesses how many would willingly come forward now?

In most other parts of India, so far the administration [has made efforts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/those-revealing-identity-of-covid-19-patients-to-face-action/articleshow/74590731.cms) to preserve patients anonymity, but I guess these rules can be bent if there are ""special circumstances"".

Yes, you could make an argument that other people need to know who they are so that they can stay away from them, but that can be easily achieved by using [hand stamps](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/privacy-fears-india-hand-stamps-suspected-coronavirus-cases-200320120033460.html) or [""Home Under Quarantine"" stickers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-covid-19-stickers-being-stamped-on-houses-of-home-quarantined-families-1660543-2020-03-28), though IMO even these methods should be employed only on willful violators. But at least with these methods, only your immediate neighbors will know rather than the entire city/nation and any potential backlash will be minimized.

Charging people with the draconian National Security Act (which allows detention without charges or trial for up to a year) is also counterproductive, while that will definitely make violent people think twice before assaulting health workers, ordinary Muslims in UP, who are already deeply distrustful of the Yogi government, will now be even less forthcoming about their symptoms to health workers. 

Similarly, by now we have all heard of [how 5000 migrant workers were sprayed with bleach](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/india/india-migrant-workers-sprayed-intl/index.html) to ""disninfect"" them. After being treated this way, do you think any of them will still come forward if they start showing symptoms?",cncrndctzn2," In odisha the spokesperson for the government and a Muslim MLA appealed to Muslims to not be afraid and come forward to register and their identities will be kept secret. Thankfully the identities of none of our covid 19 cases (neither Hindu or Muslim) have been leaked. Also anyone who gets infected is a patient who needs treatment from a highly infectious fast-spreading non-discriminating virus, not a terrorist or anti-national. COVID19 has wrecked havoc across the world and everywhere governments are trying to find hospital beds, ventilators, and medicines for the ill, and here in India we are trying to find who to blame. This jamaat gives media the opportunity to steer away attention from the stranded migrants situation, so this won't stop. Jamaat guys infecting others is a better headline than the hungry crying migrant family pic coz it shows administration in bad light Agreed. It's genuinely worrying to think about the number of cases that might pop out once this lockdown is over since there are so many people who need to be tested but aren't. Putting fear in people is only doing worse. I'm sure a lot of these people are scared that if they do come forward and end up testing positive, hell will break over them.",2020-04-05 11:21:00
Politics,Can Assam Look Beyond Ethnic and Regional Politics?,7,en9dfb,https://indianculturalforum.in/2020/01/10/can-assam-look-beyond-ethnic-and-regional-politics/?fbclid=IwAR0_Mc1lMXufvsPfTzCPJNYXEPD-aGABLOD2jbu-2DhZC6WgLO2UJGx30Rs,7,,hammyhammad," Can? No, Assam HAS look to beyond ethnic boundaries, cause the NRC failed, and it did so in epic proportions. For fucks sake, many Rabhas, Koches, Rajbanghsis, and Bodos were out of the final list. Apart from these Bhumiputras, several tea tribes and people who lost their belongings due to floods, evictions, and various other reason were left out. 

This might hurt egos of Assamese nationalists, but their fight is over. Bengalis are here to stay, and they should probably demand an autonomous council to 'safeguard' Upper Assam, the last bastion of the Ahomyias, Mishmis, Chutiyas, and Deoris; which is very unlikely cause the Assamese will never get tribal status (and they shouldn't). 

Although there's one thing about liberals like Mr. Gogoi I don't get is that fact that he has in previous articles mentioned how it was only Bengali speaking Muslims who were targeted during the anti foreigner movement in the 80s and he attributes it as some sort of 'amnesia' on the part of individuals who support Assamese nationalism and but also reject the CAA, which could be further from the truth cause just a week before the  Nellie massacre, a horrible pogrom which should be talked about more, 100-500 Bengali speaking Hindus in Khoirabari were massacred in a similar fashion. And there are several other pogroms that took place in a similar fashion in the years following '83. It isn't to say that there is no element of Hindu nationalism in Assam, but, honestly it is negligible, unless you say it's somewhat intertwined with Assamese nationalism. Although one must realize that even Assamese speaking Muslims (both Miyas and indigenous) have supported AASU and the anti foreigner movement. Assamese chauvinism is a real thing and it's a threat to several indigenous tribes and even Bengalis, but I think that's a debate for another day. 

u/ayr909: what do you infer? For that illegal infiltrators must assimilate into greater Assamese society. Without it, there can be no peace ever.

Assamese/Bodo/Mising etc language can be left to die because govt wants to promote a Bangladeshi votebank in Assam.",2020-01-12 00:19:30
Politics,"Babasaheb’s warning: In politics, hero-worship is a path to degradation and eventual dictatorship",295,di67qv,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/constitution-babasaheb-ambedkar-warning-hero-worship-6069022/,52,,iheartsubmariner," All should heed the tales of past dictators, including Idi Amin, Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, several Roman Emperors, Adolf Hitler, General Franco, Rudolf von Goldenbaum, several Pakistani presidents, the former King of Nepal, Tito, Pol Pot, Bashar al-Assad, Omar al-Bashir, Robert Mugabe etc.

Why do we never learn to shirk the cult of personality? Indians have always been susceptible to hero worship.

Our nations spine was broken under colonial rule, and it has been ingrained into our psyche to be on our knees looking up at someone with arms clasped together. 

That's why we have temples for actors, politicians and cricketers. People who are just ordinary people, some not even worthy of respect, doing their jobs. Sadly in those sections of society you can only get votes by being their hero or their god, not their friend. Funny thing is that people hero worship Ambedkar too. Maybe our caste system has ingrained in us to hope for a benevolent ""upper"" consequently translating into hero worship. Dont bring such foreign concepts to India. These are not applicable, create something indigenous /s Ambedkar agar ek brahmin hote, toh yeh log unhe bhagwan se badhkar pujate. We literally have a dry day on Ambedkar Jayanti. You know what also Ambedkar stood for:

2. Not having Article 370",2019-10-15 18:55:31
Politics,Dalit man's wedding procession taken out under police protection in Gujarat's Banaskantha district after some upper-caste people allegedly pelted stones as they objected to the groom sitting on horse,447,f51j78,https://twitter.com/PTI_News/status/1229077679636283392?s=19,98,,Gavthi_Batman," Sometimes it feels like India isn't going forward but going backward in the time.... building statues, Religious disharmony, casteism on rise, society that lives on rumors...

Also, the crazy part, Police gave protection to bridegroom but no one dared to raise finger at Upper cast assholes.

Edit: https://indianexpress.com/article/india/gujarat-wedding-procession-of-dalit-armyman-targeted-because-he-rode-mare-11-booked-6271501/lite/ This is exactly the justification for reservation. If people cannot bear a person sitting on a horse, how can they tolerate to be their boss? Best part of this news is ""Ironically, the horse itself belonged to a man from the upper caste Thakor community, he said.""

Sad part of news is bridegroom is   an Army jawan posted in Jammu and Kashmir. Hindutwa is not for all Hindus. It is only for the rich and powerful, including the upper caste. It is not for Dalits and it is not for the impoverished upper caste. 

As time passes, and if RSS keeps having its way, all Muslims, Dalits, and impoverished Hindus would be disfranchised gradually. 

Today it is Muslims.  
Tomorrow it is Dalits.  
Next it is the impoverished.

RSS wants to cleanse India of these parasites. And Hindus are ready for that in the name of Krishna and Ram honorations. And they criticize reservation system, once they remove reservation system these types of incidents will emerge even more. It's not a reservation system, its the feeling developed inside us. Pelting a Jawan.....these pelters deserve to be called traitors There are two types of discriminations in India.

One this kind of caste discrimination in rural India where real education is given zero importance.

Two status discrimination in cities. You cannot setup a high end startup or business like restaurant or a bakery without local mla or politicians first getting their share. Next paying percentage of interest. Unless otherwise you are chamcha of politician or his binami , there is no way you can thrive with your own business ideas. That's why brand growth or global conglomerate never spore out.  
What ever major business you see today are somehow connected to Aditya birla, ambanis, tatas and few other family business started by people from rich family heritage pre independence.
Thank God I am out of India and settled in USA, the true land of opportunities, atleast as of today Shame on Gujarat. I'm surprised the police did not trouble the procession But hey reservation affects India's growth.

Point to think !?!?! Is the reservation or the casteist assholes affect India's growth Welcome to kal yug or dark age of human kind . 

Some one said it will reset back to normal 1 day . Meanwhile, Chutiyon!! Sab changa Si. [deleted] This I can get behind. No one should be sitting on a horse. Poor animal should be allowed to roam free. For people using this incidence to justify reservations, The stone pelters belongs to Thakor community. It is an OBC community. They have the highest reservation at 27%.",2020-02-17 10:21:30

Let me translate to you what modi is saying : 

*""You all are dumb sheeps, you don't need to bother thinking how would country manage this epidemic when we are not even testing properly. You don't need to look into what we are doing, It's okay that we didn't banned export of ventilators and masks until just few days ago because we were busy buying MLAs in MP. You don't have brain, just be silent and follow our stupid commands.""*

* According to the guidelines passed by govt. If someone was in contact with confirmed coronavirus patient and if he ask to doctor to test him for COVID-19 then the guidelines don't allow that test, since he was not a foreign travelers.

Not only that, their was more guidelines which contradicted the previous ones and according to these you simply cannot test a person for COVID-19 if he/she does not have foreign travel history. (these were only changed few days ago)
