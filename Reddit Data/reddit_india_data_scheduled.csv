Scheduled,Why the Supreme Court’s verdict on SC/ST quotas has created a political storm | It has upheld the state’s powers to deny reservations to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities.,108,f1o839,https://scroll.in/article/952687/why-the-supreme-courts-verdict-on-sc-st-quotas-has-created-a-political-storm,47,,rahulthewall," Muslims and reservation are two distractions used by Indian elites to confuse people. These two are blamed for all of India's problems and people are stupid enough to believe it. 




Honestly, as a dalit I sometimes wish let them remove reservation. Then let them explain to masses how 1% Indians are getting 73% Indian wealth. Within decade there will be riots in streets and true people responsible for Indian poverty will be found out. Sizable dalit tribal population doesn't understand how system is rigged against them, they think reservation is making some difference. These guys can finally wake up. You have 22.5% reservation for 29% SC,ST in government jobs which are just 4% of total jobs. And people think this is useful or something. The main question we need to ask is where are the damn jobs ? I have said previously that Scheduled Castes and Tribes are next on the list after Muslims.

Looks like I was wrong. They're targeting everyone at the same time, just with a different approach. >The other problem is also the court’s selective affirmation of the state’s discretionary powers for providing reservations. When it comes to a decision not to provide reservations, the court feels the state has absolute discretion and need not collect data to justify this decision. But when the state wants to provide quotas, the court brings in the concept of equality and places several restrictions that dilute the discretionary power of the state. The 50% ceiling for quotas is an example of this restriction.


This alone is enough to show how the SUPREME COURT is disingenuous and biased as hell and their end goal isn't equality of any sorts. First they stopped making it compulsory for promotion in government jobs and now will give only lower level jobs to reservations.
Second they stopped compulsory arrest in SC/St act and will give pree arrest anticipatory bail to the accused.

This is the destruction of the act itself. 

Bc reservation is not the government spooge to give its a bloody constitutional right. Get that modi shah I wish the govt does try fucking around with the reservations. I truly pray that they somehow think that by making their stooges pass such judgements that they can alter the basic tenets of reservations and try curtailing it. It will be the end of this govt. Period. Come on BJP/RSS! Try messing with reservations. Please. You can do it!! Show us how tough you are. First Moslems , now SC/ST ; good job BJP judiciary /govt . Golly what is with this government? Talk to upper caste, and they believe BJP is shit and giving SC/ST everything. Talk to SC/ST, they say its upper caste party

Who the fuck voted for these mfs? I believe reservations  should be based on economic conditions and not on caste.
The reason is many sc's and st's have a high family income yet take advantage of reservation.
On the other hand there are many general candidates that have very low family income yet have no such advantage.

Reservations(if any) should be used to lift the distressed classes and not lift the already uplifted.",2020-02-10 18:00:46

I think it's a well known, well documented reality of our times that work balance life is highly trash in India.

Work environments are largely toxic too due to a culmination of many internal & external factors.

The commute eats into a substantial time of the day for most folks as well on top of this. 

Are there any organizations in India who have already implemented a 4 day week - or are such plans in the pipeline for companies?

What are your thoughts on such an initiative - does anyone reckon it will succeed here?",PuneriPerson," The single biggest minus point about Indian society is the non-existence of clear communication and lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with things.  

Such being the case, the 4 hour workday won't work because that kind of productivity requires an enormous amount of clarity with the undestanding that the everyone involved is working hard to get the job done. Japan and India are two entirely different animals.

Japan has an ageing workforce. It also has a work environment that emphasises employees working long hours. The stress had in recent times resulted in multiple news reports of employees committing suicide which had prompted a national outcry and condemnation.

In addition to this, the work-nolife balance also resulted in men and women choosing to marry late or choosing to delay having children. This isn't good considering the already low population growth rate in the country. This has even led to the mechanisation of many low end jobs in Japan because they can't find enough people to work.

So a 4 day work week might work in a country like Japan which is carrying out iniatives in order to promote population growth. The 4 day work week has a high synergy with these objectives.

India meanwhile has a high population growth, high unemployment and a young workforce. The competition here has prompted firms to cut costs in order to maintain profit. This often means a smaller workforce, which still does the same amount of work by taking longer hours; but without any commiserate increase in remuneration. 

Even when an employee is burned out, the rat race in India is so bad that there is always an enormous pool of often unemployed/underemployed applicants who are ready to be hired at short notice for a lower pay. So the employers can simply choose to fire the burned out employees and hire new recruits to keep the assembly line at work.

Long story short: In Japan, employees are still a key human resource. In India, they are an expendable tool. Many times we have to work on weekends anyways. Can't think why that will change. And it won't matter if your clients work 5 days a week. Your opinion doesn't matter. [The decision has already been made](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-avoids-fixing-minimum-wage-in-draft-rules-suggests-9-hour-working-day-11572758439316.html).

> 26 days of work in a month

Which basically means 6 days a week.

So yeah, go fuck yourself. The Government has already decided 6 days a week, 9 hours a day for everybody. Bhai middle managers won't let this happen. Mandated 5 day work week would be a start. Apart from MNCs and few central government offices, everyone else works on Saturdays. also what would be the secondary effects of this move - as participation in hobbies, skill growth, lower commute \ traffic congestion - shall all have largely stimulating advantages in the overall environment. 

I am fascinated by what the results of such an experiment will be if implemented on a controlled, small scale. I think India would better benefit from more Work-from-home options. For example, come to office twice a week and wfh other days, especially in congested cities like bangalore. Now even Saturday and Sunday leave is a problem. Either you have to work om weekends due to some emergency or they load you with so much work and such deadlines that you end up working on weekend. If we deny the manager will say even we went through this or we will be simply released as there will be 1000s ready to work on saturday and sunday. Talk about negative competition. population (s)explosion That's like taking 3 steps at a time. First jobs need to be 6-8 hours long 6 days a week. Generally people are given ""work from home"" even on Sundays. Not to mention people work till 8 when they were supposed to be home by 5 or 6pm.

LOL. I was recently ghosted by a startup for letting them know I wasn't comfortable with their 6 day a week schedule (Monday to Saturday, every single week). Read on if you're interested.  

________________

**Back story -**

I recently interviewed at a startup for a tech role (Data Scientist) and was going through the final so-called ""cultural fit"" interview. I have almost 3 years of experience in the field. I currently work at a startup that works Monday to Friday (40 hours a week).   

Just doing my due diligence, I asked the interviewer if they work on Saturdays. To my disappointment, he said they do. Now, this was my 5th interview round. Not once did they tell me about their Mon-Sat schedule. I only got to know because I asked. 

For some context, this startup is 4 years old, have their product out in the market and have close to 30 employees (their claim - I was never invited to their office and all interviews happened on the phone in the course of a single week).   

As soon as I heard of their 6 day work schedule, I was disappointed. I mean, coming from a startup background myself, I understand the kind of hard work people need to put in every once in a while. Working on Saturdays during emergencies and other critical events is perfectly fine, but every single week? Come on! 

Oh, and I also would get **no** equity for my work there.  

But working on weekends wasn't necessarily a deal breaker to me. I just wanted to put myself in their shoes and know *why*. 

I mentioned to the guy upfront that my current organisation works 5 days a week, and that my life is built around a Mon-Fri schedule so it will be difficult to adjust to a 6 day work week.    

The guy must have realised my disappointment (this was on the phone), and so he started talking about how much potential this company has for growth and how much I could grow with the company. 


Anyway, I wanted to ask them their rationale for working every Saturday the next time we spoke, and also to evaluate for myself whether sacrificing my social life and hobbies for a job was worth it. 

Coincidentally, this conversation happened on a Friday, I got a text message the next day (Saturday), saying ""Let's close this today"". I had a long week and I switched off for the next two days and I didn't respond until Monday. I apologised for the delay, saying that I took some time off for the weekend and was ready for a discussion.    

That was it. I never heard from them again. I never said no to working on Saturdays, but still they ghosted me. I guess they wanted someone who would be submissive and not question their wisdom. 

Which is a shame, because the product (from what they told me, seemed interesting) but some of my friends say this was good riddance. Part of the problem is that our labour regulations and enforcement is, mildly put, absolutely terrible. Looking at indian labour laws is a crash course in the necessity of updating laws to new circumstances and the need to discard old laws in an expeditious manner rather than just getting by on the courts desperately trying to make the woefully inadequate laws fit the needs of today.

Even in sectors with massive deficits of required workers (such as medicine and law), the actual worker holds little power since regulations are lax and there's no one powerful actually standing up for them. A doctor or lawyer, especially one that's just starting out, will universally work long hours at the cost of his health; not because he's easily replaced, but because his managers are, for the most part, so inept that it would be tragic if it weren't hilarious. The iron law of wages is evident here for most to see.

Now how this can be remedied is a task in and of itself. It starts right from said horribly convoluted and loophole riddled regulations to the rather asinine practices of promoting professionals to managerial positions based on their ability to do their original job (a good doctor or lawyer isn't a good manager or leader) and linking payments to said promotions (which forces said professionals to seek such positions for better remuneration).

And yes, there's more to it than that, but the short answer is that the problem is very much systemic. This is as much cultural (if not more so) than it is economic. And that wages do not reflect demand or skill (otherwise we'd be paying the people who clean gutters more than any corporate CEO or hedge fund manager), they reflect status and power. 4 days working !! What a joke for Indian owners. I can see some of my friends are working on Saturdays also. Also, some are happy with their alternative Saturday holidays. I am sure as The sun that India will never implement this type of formula. Even government will do, Private company owners they will never spend a minute to think about it. You talking about 4 days working last month I worked on 2nd October without getting extra pay !! It's not like I'm talking about small towns this scene is available in one of the Metro city in India and only officially declared heritage city of India :) Would never work with our work ethic. Already mondays and fridays half the day is gone in either reaching late after leave travels or leaving early for leave travel. I still know people working in 6 days week. Even I used to work 6 days few years back. Let's make a uniform 5-day work week first. Better to learn to walk before attempting to run. I don't think that would work out over here. We've got a pretty laid-back work culture as is. most of the work in India is about availability and not about capability , our work culture is a reflection of it ( in both public and private sectors ) , Being specific to IT companies we are mostly cost centres which do really little productive work hence the moment we go for a 3 day weekend thereby increasing cost , these jobs will be outsourced to a cheaper location. Also apart from the '**highly questionable work culture**' we also suffer from highly questionable work ethic , as employees some treat their job as time-pass activity  working as seat warmers. For these people a 3 day weekend is pointless.

3 day weekend boost productivity which is amazing for people involved in demanding profiles, for this strategy to work in India we will need to have jobs that involve R&D ,planning or designing  . The problem is this kind of work demands attention and critical thinking, something our newer generation is quite not trained due to being spoon fed in schools with meaningless grades and ignored by professors in higher studies . Hence the 2nd thing will be reform our education system which emphasises more on thinking and less on following. It will work only if the office remains open six or seven days a week and there are alternate workers for those days which others have off.

That will kill both the unemployment problem and improve worker productivity. Might work where creativity is given large portion of importance..

For labour , essential services like hospital , it wont work , as this will hamper production in case of industries , and routine work procedure in case of health care industry. Service-based IT companies have their heads up their clients' asses. Middle and onsite managers make unrealistic promises to clients and make their subordinates work like a dog.

Much of this behavior stems from keeping their bosses happy, which was prevalent even during previous generations. So, I really don't see this happening until the time companies choose to treat their employees with respect. Yes, but only if people stopped the casual chit-chat over chai breaks, numerous smoke breaks, discussing cricket/politics breaks, taking personal calls at work breaks, hour long lunches and so on. [deleted] [deleted] Will it benefit the people? Yes, Of course.  
Will it benefit the companies? In the long run, yes.

I'd like to bring on a few points here:

* Japan is a labour shortage economy, yet the country is so culturally driven that loyalty and long working hours is a norm. You will find a huge faction of the workforce working for their first company throughout their career.
* India on the other hand is a labour surplus, and that too at the number one spot. In short, if you don't want to work long hours, there are literally thousands who would.
* This was done by just one company, Microsoft, which isn't even Japanese. They just tried it as an experiment, and 'might' do it again in the future.
* In a report produced a few months back, Indians turned out to be the employees taking the least holidays in the world. Technically it was correct, but didn't mention the procedures, the unapprovals, the interrogation involved with leaves in India. With such an approach of the organisations towards employees where taking leaves is ""not caring about the well-being of the organisation"", there's little hope of 4 day work-week.

I am a Senior Manager- Human Resources in one of the top media companies, and no matter what the terminology is - Human Resource, Human Capital, Personnel, Talent, Pink Squirrels, HiPots - the companies (there are exceptions) know that unemployment rates are high and that they can choose to treat employees like robots with little to no consequences. I have worked in a 4 day shift model back in 2008 and 2009, we had to trade off weekends. My working days used to be tue, fri,sat,sun. First implement 5 days, 8 hrs/day properly. Forget everything else. Work from Home once a week NEEDS to be a thing right now. Work culture is bad? 

Are you fucking kidding me? We Indians are lazy and most of teenagers and college going students that I have seen are complete morons. Even the new job takers have no skill and no desire to sit and learn.

If you think this is 'bad work culture and hard' then you are simply WEAK. Learn to fight. There are people surviving with no resources and you can't even survive and thrive after getting an excess of monthly income?! Shame on you And lose all that sweet outsourcing $$?

No, thank you very much. I'd rather jobs stay here than go to our Asian rivals. Use some basic sense.

We are a growing country and need to constantly do so just to keep up with the population growth let alone generating enough GDP to life people out of poverty.

Now imagine the whole indian work force stops working for one whole day every week? Does not even bear thinking about.

Everyone wants a work free chillax life, not everything the heart wants is good

Scheduled,Job Consultancy companies request PAN Card before scheduling interview and then cancel the interview after sending the resume and PAN card. Possible scam?,25,esd9js,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/esd9js/job_consultancy_companies_request_pan_card_before/,8,"So my wife has been trying to attend interviews in the last couple of weeks, I have noticed a trend which kind of raises a red flag. 

The consultancy calls up for a potential opening in some company, they inform that the interview is next day and request to share the resume and PAN Card details. Once these information is sent, she gets a mail from the consultancy saying that this position is put on hold. 

It has happened three times already. It looks like some kind of scam. 

Why do they ask for PAN Card? Is it safe to provide the PAN Card? Can they do anything malicious with the PAN?",MasterApotheosis," This has happened to me. I got suspicious about and tried searching on Google and it indeed is a scam. 

I read somewhere that this companies need to show its workforce to clients companies to get the projects. By this way they can show inflated workforce without actually hiring that much no of people. A ghost employee to manipulate the balance sheet ! Never give your PII before the final round and compensation discussion

Send only to company HR email Id and not to consultants or agency Haven't you or your wife asked them why they need PAN before interview?

I don't know how PAN card can be misused but I wouldn't hand out any document like this. Yes",2020-01-22 23:08:25

Ok this is fine but wtf is this

> Suresh said the woman's uncle is threatening him against approaching the police. 

Do they expect these two live a happy life after having seen the reaction by the husband? Is the taboo of divorce so strong? Still gullible Parents will force for Arranged Marriage. Singles enjoying this drama. 😂😂😂 Beat wife - yes

Have toxic relationship - yes

Have multiple partners - yes 

&#x200B;

Divorce - Fuck no - log kya bolega Shit like this happens more to people named ""Suresh"" The husband should thank the other guy for helping him dodge a bullet and call it a day. woman and lover can have sex but can’t marry each other, happily destroying another mans hopes. Why are people like this. HAHAHA

>  And the incident took place just days before the two were to consummate their wedding. 

Consummation:

> In many traditions and statutes of civil or religious law, the consummation of a marriage, often called simply consummation, is the first act of sexual intercourse between two people, either following their marriage to each other or after a short or prolonged romantic/sexual attraction. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consummation I don't understand, why was this 'Rahul' guy arrested? So basically,

Now she can't be with the 'Rahul' guy because he leaked an intimate video, no resao of going back to him.

Suresh won't keep her either. Why should he? 


This just went tits up.

People are fucking stupid. Please refer the case to Neha dhupia. > Their first wedding night was scheduled for December 15.

CMMI Level 5 processes even during sex. Did they also fix a date when the conception would occur and for the child to be born? Guys even if you do shit.. don't fucking post it on Social Media. Keep shit private. This looks like something Times would make up for pageviews. Lately, they have been twisting facts, especially around Corona to create sensational news. Shame on these guys. No wonder people refer to Times as Toilet Paper. Guys, don't go for arranged marriages. Made in heaven - Part 2 Guy has a chance to pull out, literally The problem here is not so much the woman and her family, as the ridiculously biased, anti-men laws in this country. 

Do you guys know that if a woman dies within 7 years of marriage, the investigation has to be done by a magistrate under [Section 304B of the IPC](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/653797/), and the presumption of guilt is on the husband by default? Which means - the man will be assumed guilty by default. All your wife has to do is make some cuts and bruises on herself and the courts assume she committed suicide because of dowry harassment, and will send you to jail for 7+ years.

Our law still operates in the 19th century mindset, according to which all women are angels, capable of no wrongdoing, and must be protected from the evil men in society who are out to get them. Oh, and they can never have any premarital or extramarital relationships - they all are virtuous virgins by default.

In this country if you are ever wronged by a woman, it is better to shut your mouth and take it quietly. If you look to the law for recourse, the law will smack you down, throw you in a dark dingy prison and probably champion the verdict as a victory for women's rights. I mean why How can you call the cops if someone is cheating? Is this even valid? The reddit jury would like to view this ""porn clip"" as evidence, please and thank you [deleted]",2020-03-17 14:19:46
Scheduled,The Continuing Practice of Untouchability in India.,2605,eptyqa,https://i.redd.it/91hssr5m29b41.jpg,643,,Gavthi_Batman," My state, Manipur might have perrenial conflicts but I am proud, there is no practice of untouchability. Jai Maharashtra I used to be so confused about untouchability when I was little. I used to hear how the untouchables were mistreated by almost everyone. I thought why don't they just riot or fight those people mistreating them, after all they can't touch the untouchables! Later someone told me you could still touch them with sticks and stones. Damn, I was so ignorant. I live in a semi Village locality in West Bengal,can confirm most of the household still practice untouchability. Mostly with the maids of their house. I would like to see the correlation with percentage of 12th standard educated students. It's probably very high.

There is a reason why politicians don't like a well educated populace. Stupid people are easily manipulated into forming tribes and fighting each other. I’m curious to know what in Kerala and Bengals history was different from the Hindi belt. I’m surprised Maharashtra is so radically different from surrounding states. You would think that the border regions would have some sort of gradient in attitudes... Come on Cow belt. Please change. We are in 21st century **SOURCE:**

>An extensive study by Amit Thorat teaches economics at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. Omkar Joshi is a doctoral scholar at the Department of Sociology, University of Maryland, Washington on **The caste (jati)-based practice of untouchability in India.**

>This article is based on nationally representative data of 42,152 households, surveyed in 2011–12, which, for the first time, asked direct questions on caste and the practice of untouchability. This data is part of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), a panel survey conducted in 2004–05 and 2011–12, which is a joint undertaking of the National Council of Applied Economic Researchand the University of Maryland.

>The household schedule of the 2011–12 IHDS posed the following question to the primary respondent of each of the enumerated survey households: “Do some members practise untouchability in your household?” The respondent’s answer was recorded as a “Yes/No” response. In case the response was a “No,” it was followed by the second question: “Would there be a problem if someone who is a Scheduled Caste were to enter your kitchen or share utensils?,” again seeking a “Yes/No” response. Any household that responded in the affirmative to both or either of the two questions was regarded as practising untouchability.

https://www.epw.in/journal/2020/2/special-articles/continuing-practice-untouchability-india.html It doesn't matter how much you study or earn money, we(untouchables) are always looked down upon. 
Economically sound hai to reservation ki kya zaroorat
Padha Likha hai , reservation ki vajah se isko Kuch Nahi AATA Hoga
Kaam ekdum (insert lower caste name) Jaise

I still remember when we lived in UP ,the house maid found out that we are dalit ,she left the work next day and same day we were asked to vacate the house. When we vacated the house my dad told me the landlords cleaned the whole house with Ganges water. Word got out and my family was socially ostracized , suddenly friends stoped talking to me. teachers called me with casteist slurs.
It was a living nightmare we had to leave the city

Now I still have to lie about my caste everywhere I go ,they all act progressive but in reality they are the backward ones

The most hilarious thing is people are ready to drink cow urine but won't touch food made by an untouchable Kerala of 1800s and early 1900s were extremely casteist, probably one of the worst in the country even. I haven't heard of practices like [breast tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Tax) happening anywhere else other than Kerala. It's amazing how much we progressed in the last 60-70 years. Still, caste is not going anywhere, even in Kerala. It has gone more covert though. What I've noticed is that, many people from outside Kerala starts to probe about one's caste openly the moment you meet them. I've never experienced such things while I lived in Kerala. Unsurprisingly, it correlates with high GDP per capita and better HDI. I'm from M.P. and sc caste and i have seen people making bad/weird faces when knowing my last name. And i have seen my classmates discriminating sc/st people on the basis of reservation (""iska kya hai ye to bina padhe likhe bhi reservation se pass ho jayega/jayegi) The south seems to be far better. Interesting fact: Majority of the Hindu immigrants/refugees who will benefit from CAA are Dalits from Bangladesh, now living in Assam and West Bengal. BJP is a bit [two-faced](https://thewire.in/caste/the-two-faces-of-hindutvas-dalit-agenda) when it comes to Dalits. My district in Assam has close to 0%,feels good. I guess it correlates with education,we have the highest/2nd highest literacy rate in the State. How do they get this data? I am not questioning the validity of data. But I don't think they went house 2 house asking if people practice untouchability. These are depressing statistics Wtf whats up with some parts of himachal and uttrakhand? Thought my states didnt had it this bad. Nice to see my home state doing good-ish here. Still 5% is 5% too much. Shit needs to stop. I am noticing a pattern when it comes to every major problem in India. Way to go --- dont forget your Northeast Indians --- they have put aside these old beliefs --- Hindi heartland could learn a thing or two.

One observation is the long-time communist run states like Kerala and W.Bengal and the emphasis on education --- most commendable for Kerala given what its historic caste structure and history of oppression has been, even W.Bengal with the oppressive Zamindari history.

Maharashtra is interesting --- there is a common Marathi identity greater than other identifiers, possibly also the higher penchant for industry and economics.

Just my 2 paise trying to understand how this can be explained. No more claiming of North is Progressive and South is Conservative!  
Being conservative is good if you are Progressive within. In the context of this study, how are ""households practising untouchability"" defined? I was trying to see what it was from the link to the IHDS-II data, but I'm not savvy enough to figure it out.

In any case, I'm pleasantly surprised that Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala, and quite a few places in the North-East (except for the ones with no data) appear to have massively reduced the practice of untouchability in their regions. My state WB seem to do pretty well . If the data is right and good sample size is considered I'm aure it'll be even better. Maharashtra Kerala and Bengal along with the far Eastern frontier states seems considerably exceptional. Pretty predictable. But did no Jyotiba Phule or Rammohan Roy or Vidyasagar emerge in these northern states? I mean, damn look at the amount of red... pretty depressing for India as a whole... Source: [https://ihds.umd.edu/sites/ihds.umd.edu/files/publications/papers/ThoratJoshi3.pdf](https://ihds.umd.edu/sites/ihds.umd.edu/files/publications/papers/ThoratJoshi3.pdf) In case anyone wants to learn more, the documentary India Untouched offers a deeper look into untouchability and the way it's practiced in different parts of the country. Really informative and insightful. Again, not surprising that the places also map out with [where the BJP won](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election#/media/File%3AIndian_General_Election_2019.svg). South India is far more progressive, clearly. I love how the colour for 0% and no data is the same.   
TN's scenario isn't as bad as I thought. Still pretty bad considering it looks more like a north Indian state than a south Indian state from this map. Its funny that people are supporting CAA and NRC to give prosecuted minorities from neighboring countries citizenship while there are far more minorities inside the country who face discrimination and what not on a daily basis but no one cares for their pain.
Makes me wonder if the CAA and NRC is just a political stunt for vote bank or the govt really cares about the minorities. And mainland Indians have the audacity to think that the Eastern states are junglee and un-civillised. 


Completely fed up of this bigotry. How has no one mentioned Bengal, as clean(no red spots) as Maharashtra if not more. The reforms that started here spread to the villages with the 40 year communist rule instilling the values into deeper sections of society and peripheral villages too. I'm not a proponent of hardcore communism, but I feel it has had it's share of good effects amongst the many bad ones. As a North Easterner, we have our issues but mainland cancer like dowry and caste system doesnt have a foothold. Also, people eat whatever the F they want without fear of lynching! It is a tragedy that despite Dalits being more reformed in maharastra , they never attained political power like Dalits of UP, Bihar where Dalits have their own mainstream party.

All credit goes to Sharad pawar who ensure that Dalits never get mobilised. This is actually not a good measure as in reality, the figures would be much higher as many practice it but deny it Go Kerala! I'm a malayalee mumbaikar, I didn't even know this was still a thing One interesting thing I noticed is that even though this is a per-district depiction, the trends nearly line up cleanly according to the state borders.

This goes to show how the standardized mini-subcultures within each state influence people's values. The case of Bengal, Kerala, and Maharashtra is especially striking relative to their neighbhors. I hope there will be a time where it's gone completely. Proud to see Maharashtra being a progressive in this regard. wait, that looks like South Indians are more progressive and have liberal views than North India. I am shocked at Haryana. I thought they would be higher in list. *Funny how Gujarat is still a major contributor to this even considering it is the homestate of the country* I Lepe forgetting maharashtra is above Karnataka, they don't talked about much. don't know when India Will be free of all these things Very happy to see kolhapur in the white Extremely surprised to see Jains had the highest ""Yes"" percentage at 35%. I've generally considered Jains to be relatively socially forward but I guess I've been living in a liberal bubble. This is honestly very disappointing. It's 2020 now, and the practice of untouchability is still prevalent? Honestly, by now you'd thin the education system would have worked at least a little. Feels good by seeing the data for Maharashtra.
We believe in humanity and the youth of Maharashtra doing good job by spreading the humanity message. Growing up in MP, I lived in the decently sized city of Jabalpur. My dad was a police officer back when we were in India, and he got posted to a police station out in a village somewhere. The place was about an hour drive, so we used to go there on weekends or when we didn't feel like going to school.

This one time, during summer vacation, we were there for maybe 3 weeks. My brother and I used to go out and play in the fields or whatever all day long. This one time him, a few other friends, and I were playing around where we got our feel all covered in mud. After we were done, before we going home we decided to stop at this hand pump to wash out feet. We waited while this outer kid, around our age, was filling up about 3 matkas with water. He filled them all up, and left with 2 of them and said he'll be right back. While he was gone, I decided to wash my feet (his 3rd matka was out of the way). He comes back, see's me washing my feel, and gets pissed the fuck off. He doesn't say anything to me (since my father was the police incharge of the area), but he did say something to one of our friends in a Hindi dielect I didn't understand and then he threw out all the water from the matka. Confused, I asked my friend what was going on? He said this guys is from some higher caste, and they don't drink or eat anything that has come into contact with someone from a lower cast. I said I'm not even Hindu, I'm Sikh. He said since he doesn't know your caste, he's treating you as a lower caste and will refill the water.

That's when I realized shit like untouchability and caste system is still alive and well in India. An obvious and visible form of untouchability would be less harmful than invisible form where higher casts do not show they are treating lower cast people in an inferior manner but just not include  them in daily activities. Pleasantly surprised seeing Maharashtra stand alone seeing surrounded by a sea of red.

Also surprised it's not all white in Kerala. Have heard of pockets in Kasargod area that drops into Karnataka. Work needs to be done.

Extremely shocked seeing TN though. Source is from University of Maryland. Are there any citations for this research? Vegetarianism is directly proportional to Caste system if we go by this chart Anyone surprised by Gujrat being in same category as UP, Bihar? Not me. Just curious, why is the North always kinda backwards? I guess it takes a long time for people to break traditional bigotry like it does racism, generations. How is this measured? How do they collect data for this one? By asking people ? Source ? Telangana isn't quite there yet but hey, we're getting there.. some progress is better than no progress Nagaland? Really ? Which year or when was it conducted? As expected from Amiths Maharashtra looking so fair and lovely, but my home state odisha makes me sad end classism If you see south indians and west Indians are very intelligent Bengal has a lot of bad things but on this one it doesn't disappoint much , I'm curious about South Bengal because personally I haven't heard about it. Proud to be from Kerala!!! Cow belt ftw The cow-belt is clearly visbile here.


Apparently making people eating beef will ensure they don't practice untouchability :)

It would also improve their literacy & give the people brains to elect better leaders.

/s Proud to be a Maratha Can someone overlay the 2019 election result over this map ? How old is this? Telangana's borders aren't on this map. Feeling Ashamed from Himachal Pradesh. I belong to the western part, Dharamshala. But the sad thing is that  so called modern areas like Shimla, Manali and Mandi are dark. It's always interesting seeing the correlation between bigotry and distance from the coast. proud of my state(Maharashtra) ^_^ As you go south , Indians get wiser . Marathi people have strong character. Well proud to be from state of Maharashtra. Land of Reformers. Shivaji Maharaj, Mahatama Jyotirao Phule, Savatri  Phule, Gokhale, ....... its huge.

Shahu Maharaj a prominent King(1874-1920) and more a reformer who setup different boarding school for different community. Abolished Mahar act, appointed non brahmin for Vedic  education, Supported Dr ambedkar during his struggling period. Free education to all during his regime. Shahu Maharaj arranged intercaste marriage of his sister  **Chandraprabhabai.**

&#x200B;

These all contributed greatly towards decreasing of untouchablilty in Maharashtra. Ah, MP is the hidden thug, often outshined by classic thugs like UP & Bihar, thanks to their massive population. 

Apart from less population density, MP is just another UP-Bihar,  it’s poor (gdp per capita: India ~$1,900, MP- $1,300, UP- $1000, Bihar - $900), has lower average literacy - 69% (2011) and it’s casteist and belongs to cow belt.

Edit; Cow belt aside Odisha & Assam have higher untouchablity practices in districts with high tribal populations (southern Odisha & eastern Assam). Is it a coincidence that all red marked states are mostly under BJP government? Look at the cow belt Nagaland? Are you kidding? First of all, we don't even have a caste system. Second of all, the indigenous people of the state mainly practice Christianity and untouchability has its roots in the Hindu caste system. I'm not really sure but besides Christianity, I suppose people in some of the far-flung places worship nature, so there's that.

But even then, if there is any validity to this data, I can vouch for the fact that this isn't because of the indigenous people. It is probably because of the migrants from other parts of India that's causing this. I haven't been much to Maharastra in my life. Any good reasons why it's so progressive in this metric? The caste system is here to stay so long as people feel proud about having born into their respective caste. Kerala Gang Rise Up My state is in a very dire state Telangana isn't quite there yet but hey, we're getting there.. some progress is better than no progress Very true and disappointing. It is so bad that a majority of people have accepted it the way it is. But there's hope from folks like we have in this community. dated? Can you provide link of this survey ? I just want to share it with other guys. Is this for 2019? How did theh even collect the Data Very disappointing picture, the middle horizontal strip area of India is still suffering with this problem. I believe educated has to play a great role to eradicate this menace. These data are chocking for everyone, a lot of work still needed This is a ten year old dataset Op, can you give us some insight on the questions asked in that survey? This just makes the case, north India is the shitty part How was this data collected any link to the source ? [deleted] The fact that the cow belt is not just red color is a victory, cannot expect any more.., How are such data ever gathered? 

I am genuinely curious. This is depressing. How about some religious artwork to cheer ppl up Surprised Telugu states are on the lighter side. I wonder how the data would look for the age below 30 Could very well be BJP rules states map. 

Oh wait. To be honest, I've never seen untouchability in Punjab. Awful seeing this. [removed] People commenting on north/south india, casually ignoring north-east..as usual Meanwhile my parents rejecting an arranged marriage proposal where the girl is from untouchable class. J&k is white due to snow You know us North Indians are the root of the problem when it's more concentrated in our area. Proud of my state West Bengal. And all the cow belt states are dragging India behind... #Gutkha-khods Interesting to see Punjab that low. Sikhism? Peasants and their problems West Bengal :-) North India still stuck in the stone age, while South focuses on education and development. if you notice it's the north side :pwe southerners are humble people lul Would be interesting to see the data for literacy rate and per capital along with this I don't understand why North India is so backward. South Is way better in almost everything. Can you explain what it means to an American Sikh? Goddamn I’m proud of Kerala! Non-Indian here, isn't untouchability prohibited by the Constitution? I though this bs died put long ago Would someone be kind enough to ELI5 the “Practice of Untouchability” in India for a foreigner coming in from r/all? me: * a north indian *

also me: those goddamn north indians 😤 mera bharat mahan Which year's data is this ? What is untouchability? Wow! We as a country Can't grow unless we get united. What does Household Practicing mean? That untouchability is practiced in households?? In brazil we just call them poor people jai jai maharashtra maza [deleted] wtf is Gujrat and Rajasthan doing? Hey American here. I’ve had classes on the class systems of India but am by far no expert and those were years ago. Was wondering if someone could explain this and if it still has to do with traditional ideals or if there is a different drive for it in present times? Any answers are appreciated. India world power 2020, biggest joke of the year Just by looking at the map, it doesn't seem to correlate with economic progress. I'm very keen to know what other metrics they can do stats with. That's the worst thing we are continuing in India. Okay. I find this hard to believe. It could be the ratio of people that believe in the caste system, but who even practices untouchability still? So crazy, as a westerner who visited India last year I had no clue this was still happening. Its so hard to pick up on all of the nuances and I guess many tourists just boil it all down to 'crazy shit everywhere' and 'chaos' haha.

 Quite sad to see that still takes place. This is shocking... when will the people learn. What is untouchability?? Hope it's more white now since the data has to be atleast 5 years old as telengana is not shown as a state . Himachal has high literacy rate and hight untouchability. 👏 Cow belt being cow belt doing gobar practices As a Tamilan, I feel ashamed. Almighty will free whole the country from Untouchability in India!! Sab Changa Si, can you free India from Untouchability si??? This doesn't seem right¿
Given its done by University of Maryland, I'm sure there wasn't groundwork done and a lot of assumptions were made This might also be kind of mis represented. as it just looks at households. But if someone is homeless, living on the streets, can still be facing untouchability. But in just the context of how certain states don't practice untouchability within people who can afford houses. What year is this report mate? Indore has zero untouchability practice. I am shocked, why does himachal has high percentage? കേരളം Quite surprised to see the data on Maharashtra especially given the Manuwadi RSS operates out of there. When was this data made ? If its an old one then definitely the numbers change will due to the rise of hindutva I don't believe this... Pretty sure the conclusion is based on very limited test cases I wonder how good this data is and what sample of people have been surveyed? This looks so flawed that i cannot even fathom the sheeple and ignorance on this subreddit. For example the darkest region is delhi and 50% of them practice untouchability. wake up sheeple - have you ever been to delhi??? Have you even heard of untouchability in delhi ? it is the most metropolitan city you will ever see . In buses the problem is over crowding and everyone touching eachother and not the other way around.

You are being pawned - use your brain for god sake. Do not think this is correct picture especially for Gujarat. Spent close to two decades there, never encountered untouchability. Castesism yes but no untouchability. I wouldn't trust the data. Link to the source would really help to validate the authenticity of the work. Can anyone provide link for this? I'm from doon i never seen anyone practicing this I'm American what is untouchability? Proud to be a south indian!! Another L for India A headsup, this dataset had been published in Year 2011-12. So data collected is almost a decade old. Wtf is untouchability.  Sounds like a good suit name.

edit: untouchable = poor Hindu [removed] [removed] [deleted] Similar to what we call today - The Reservation

&#x200B;

ffs Sadly I come from a state which is extensively red and one common sentiment that I have seen among people is reservation which is messing up with the poor people who belong to upper caste. Most of the upper class soo called 'brahmanical patriarchy' families have not been able to make their ends meet. They say that reservation and caste discrimination will go hand in hand. On the one hand you don't want to be called by the name of your caste but you'll jump with joy if the government is giving you reservations for the same. Sad but truth.",2020-01-17 10:29:25

Everything else is camouflage to get the status cleared. As I recall constitution doesn't provide any definition or criterion for a community to be deemed ST. Parliament can include or exclude any community as ST if it thinks so.

We believe it’s super important for Indians to stay level-headed & use this lockdown as an opportunity to spend some quality time with their families. In India, as we grow older and start working, we often forget about our old hobbies & the things which we used to enjoy when we were younger. 

This lockdown will last a minimum of 21 days, and everyone needs to find quality activities to fill their schedule with & things to enjoy with their families.


To solve this, [we've launched IndiaSmile](https://indiasmile.org/): A one-stop resource for the best things to do while stuck in quarantine, with a unique indian context. What's more, it's 100% non-profit and open source!


It contains:

* Best movies and TV shows to watch -- Hindi & English

* Home workout tutorials for Cardio, Yoga, Strength, and flexibility.

* Guides and apps for managing anxiety and social isolation

* Community chat to discuss & engage with

* Unbiased, scientific news

* Learning resources 


We're trying to benefit the community by providing carefully curated lists of content to consume and resources to follow, regularly updated by a team of dedicated citizens.


The IndiaSmile WhatsApp communities section aims to provide more social connections by only permitting authentic and positive content. 


We have also added [a tool to check the nearest confirmed covid case to your current safe location](https://indiasmile.org/nearme/).


Tech details: lean PWA (Progressive Web App) using Nuxt, built to have negligible load times and be super performant on all devices (especially the slower Indian ones). Offline first and heavily cached to provide extreme performance. [Completely open source & non profit](https://github.com/IndiaSmile). 


Open to contribution, ideas, and thoughts. How can we truly make this a genuine resource to help every indian successfully go through this unprecedented lockdown?

How does the nearest confirmed case tool work? Are the whatsapp groups any active ? The last tip is incorrect:

> Do not wear a facemask if you arent sick
>
> You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.

Increasingly, this is proving to be bad advice (even though it is WHO-supplied), and face masks are shown to reduce transmission. Doesn't have to be N95, even a cloth or handkerchief will help.

From [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322931/):

> S. Wearing masks outside the home in a reference period corresponding to the 2 weeks before symptom onset for cases was significantly protective against clinical SARS. Supporting the validity of this finding, there was a dose-response effect: by multivariable analysis, persons who always wore masks had a 70% lower risk of being diagnosed with clinical SARS compared with those who never wore masks, and persons with intermittent mask use had a 60% lower risk. Many persons who wore masks in the community did not use N-95 or similar highly efficient filtration devices, which have been recommended for use in the hospital setting.

Seriously though, great job OP! Good job guys! I have a suggestion. You could put an Indian household game to play with friends/ strangers online. 
Simple games like Scrabble, Guess the movie, even Ludo will be amazing.

Just one suggestion, specially related to the updates WhatsApp group

Can you do this on Telegram, because it is impossible to get ""older"" information on WhatsApp groups. You can scroll up n see stuff on Tele from before you joined.

Thank you [deleted] Great initiative guys. Found one small thing though, your old hindi songs page has a Punjabi playlist. Joined 2 whatsapp communities as well let's see how that plays out Excellent site and excellent post. How did this start?

What about games.you something similar to flash games that we used to have earlier as a quick refresher Is it a good idea to teach people how to torrent pirated stuff in the movie section? Its illegal and can get them as well as your team arrested. Not to mention our networks are already overloaded enough as it is. I loved the design on my phone, perhaps the most responsive mobile  website I've seen. Also +1 for no ads. how about a list of novels/books to read? Nice.

You guys should consider adding 'Khosla ka Ghosla' in the movies list somewhere. Loved the HIMYM pic you've used to represent Tv series, usually it's GoT I would love to contribute. Amazing! One suggestion you can add a general aged group based online learning material. I see this is Open source. I'll try forking. Great work. You are a good man OP! Maybe add a foriegn section for movies and series'? I can help with the suggestions. Are you collecting & storing any user location & personal data when people access the listed web site?
Asking as no user privacy & data usage policy is listed on site. Great stuff, thanks for doing this and sharing here.

Is the nearby town safe at midnight for family?",Direct_Equivalent," I am assuming by car.

Unless you are like a real enthu astro/aero geek. I wouldn't recommend esp with family. More than safety, it will be very tiring, if you are trying to drive up and down in one shot.

If you break it up into 2 night trip it will be better idea. Pulikat lake is quite a sight esp if the birds are in town. Find a decent hotel within 1hr distance along the highway. Town everything will be booked up esp for this launch.

There is just one road leading to the site and security will stop you 5-6 km away, but you can take the mud road along the lake to the right of that security check point and find a good place to sit.

There are hundreds of people these days who watch from that road. It's not crowded or anything because its a very large lake bed and you can see the launch from any point along that road.

Also go post/read on r/isro you might find a lot more details from others  there.

If its not cloudy and weather is good, a night launch is pure magic. I want the answers too. Do we need to buy a ticket or something? Heard from someone that you could buy tickets couple of months before the launch.

Scheduled,I am from Shaheen Bagh and I hope the protest here ends.,34,fahqeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fahqeu/i_am_from_shaheen_bagh_and_i_hope_the_protest/,15,"I remember the day of violence at Jamia university. I had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached Mathura Road, a major road in Delhi, the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police, a violent lathi-charge. He said, people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over. Next thing he sees is buses burning, police firing gun on protestors. 

All I said to him is, "" I wish people didn't protest because this will not yield anything"", he didn't believe me so, I switched on my TV and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media. He was shocked. Next day Shaheen Bagh protest started and rest is history. But never once did I think from day one that BJP will talk or courts will intervene. And never believed that this was a good idea as Shaheen Bagh road is major thoroughfare between Noida , Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because I know most people don't really care what the Indian Muslim thinks. 

It has all come true, and today as more than ever, I wish this protest ended. 

I was brought up in India and never did I consider this country to be more than a Hindu nation, with Muslims living in their ""aukaat"". I grew up watching Mahabharata, Ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television, visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of Hinduism in government that established that. As you grew older, met kids who had never met a Muslim and knew zilch about Islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about Muslims as facts. Countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto. But now my ghetto, which is chose for security over facilities is gone. 

But the thing is, I had learnt to live with that. But this protest makes me feel unsafe. I feel noticed. I don't want that. Till this protest , nobody knew what was Shaheen Bagh, I liked that. Now I feel exposed and worried that I might have crossed my ""aukaat"" and will soon feel the punishment for it. So please my friends at the protest, please stop it.



PS: just my rant, thought, don't downvote because you don't agree, kindly comment or else move on.

Edit : I also do not want the protest to end. You have to understand that as a Muslim in India, I am used to keeping my head down and going on with life. But this, this is totally new. This is a revolt of a sort, which totally makes lots of people among us nervous, we get these thoughts and I just articulated it here. Thank you all for the support and understanding.",zafar_bull," Well if the protest ends here then its a amit shah victory he got a new template.... dangay karao protest khatam and you will see that applied all over india. If someone is protesting peacefully against injustice they have every right I understand and empathize with your perspective. However, if you want the protest to end, that means you are okay with giving up the only resistance there exists against the CAA. Without the protests (and essentially no one being outraged), the Act gets implemented silently and obediently, and you are at the mercy of this genocidal government. You are okay with atrocities being committed against people of your religion and possibly you yourself. There is literally no other fight available to people right now other than peaceful protesting, even if it may eventually lead to nothing. At least it keeps international media attention on India and possibly reduces the damage inflicted on Muslims or postpones it. Unless you have a better alternative than protesting.

If you are okay with protesting, but not in Shaheen Bagh because it makes your life more difficult, and would rather that the protests moved elsewhere in a different locality, your argument is selfish, albeit valid, but undoubtedly selfish. And there's no merit in that for me, sorry. You would rather that someone else gets inconvenienced and threatened, and while of course that may be a natural reaction, it is not very endearing. No, OP. 

Do you think that if all protests end , the hatred will stop? 

No. 

Do you know what bjp's no. 1 weapon is? 

It is hate. Hate will always exist in people's hearts unless these hindutva goons sitting in the Centre are thrown. We need everyone in our country to realise that hateful hyper nationalism is very bad. Oppression is very bad. 


And it is only achievable through protests. Times are hard now but trust me when I say that this protest is the only reason people have hope right now. They already had the chronology planned they always had the plan to attack the minorities. We all know what they wanted. But the protest made a revolt against them and people not only from minorities but also the majority of Hindu’s started joining. This protest is not between Hindu and muslims. Its a protest of the educated vs the oppressor. They want you to go weak and they will land the first blow. But they cant take away the hope and the unity of the people because religion comes after humanity. You can be a muslim or a hindu but firstly we’re an Indian and we learnt to respect all the religions. I understand your opinion and perspective but I have a question for you. Would you also advice women in your house to cooperate with the rapist to reduce the pain in case someone attacks them? We've seen similar events play out in Indian history multiple times. But just taking events which have been done by the duo at the helm of the country right now:

* If Gujarat is any indication, there might be pogroms in the future for Muslims followed by segregated housing (similar to Ahmedabad).

* If Assam is any indication, the NRC process will be brutal, imprecise and disproportionately affect poor people.

* If the Kashmiri Pandit exodus/genocide is any indication, the (current) ruling party is willing to just keep using some token crowd as a political prop to suit its agenda without actually doing anything for them.

* If modern Kashmir is any indication, the government is willing cut off basic necessities (e.g. internet) for months just to enforce their police state, jail people without reason etc.

* If the demonetization is any indication, the government is willing to put its own citizens at huge risk just to win an election (UP election) and on the basis of some tinpot economics.

If you look at other events in Indian history (Sikh riots, Kashmiri Pandit exodus, Mumbai riots of 1993, 1983 Nellie massacre) we can see the patterns emerge here as well.

We've seen such events play out elsewhere in the world too. India is not unique in this respect.

The NRC-CAA process preceded by a pogrom? Your documents will burn in your houses and then you'll be forced to somehow produce those documents to prove your citizenship. It'll leave a lot of casualties - and now only the non-Muslims will get citizenship back through CAA. You go to a 'detention' camp.

This is an existential crisis for Muslims so I'm not surprised that they are taking to the streets...

Let's not forget this

Our route is (in that order): New Delhi, Jaipur, Agra, Kanpur, Varanasi, Kolkata and we want to use trains to move between them. On one hand it's safer and more robust to book everything online and not worry about the ticketing, but on the other we want to be flexible since nothing goes as planned.

What would you recommend? What's your experience?",5hrp," Travelling in trains in India on non-reserved tickets is not something you would want to do. 

There's only about a month left so you better hurry and book your tickets on www.irctc.co.in otherwise you would not even get a reserved ticket.

To have a better idea about what type of tickets to book, search for 'What does 1A, 2A, 3A, SL, CC, 2S mean in Indian trains'. I would recommend you to book 3AC tickets.

Edit: You can book tickets 1 day before train's departure day under Tatkal quota too but it's risky and its costs extra money. Tickets can be sold out in under 5 minutes after it opens. You will get tickets easily even in Tatkal a day before while you are travelling Kanpur to Varanasi and Varanasi to Kolkata. 
I always used to take tickets a day before while I was living in Kolkata and coming to Varanasi my hometown. 

One of my friend used to stay in Kanpur and I often used to visit it in the same manner. .

If nothing is planned and you want a flexible journey, then you can do tickets a day before but be a little cautious and do it as soon as ticket booking opens, which is 10 a.m for A.c class and 11 a.m for sleeper class.  I would suggest you to book confirm ticket now, if it is available. You can cancel it later, if there is a change of plan and book a Tatkal ticket. 

You can text me if you want more information about the places to visit or any help or have any confusion regarding these cities. Get the NTES app on your phone for live train status. It's the official app and it's good. Do you have a non Indian passport ? Foreigners have a quota in most major trains and you can purchase reserved tickets under this category from major train stations like New Delhi Railway station. It might be difficult to find seats in regular category on trains if you use the online route as trains get booked fairly in advance. Goodluck !

I read that it has been cancelled and everyone is reaching Gateway of India instead as students have been protesting there since 12am last night. Add : Guwahati, Nehru Park 4PM Just a reminder - from past experience during Lok Pal Bill protests and Nirbhaya protests - outcome wasn't end of corruption and rape - best outcomes happened where Organizations got built. And Connections between various orgs were strengthened.

Know (build awareness of) the various orgs in your region and help build connections between them.

Initially 3 people might show up from each, then 10 then 100 as violence and unacceptable behavior increases.

When the next round happens, and it will, the more organized people and groups are govt starts backing down from instant automatic reactions.

Whether it is student bodies - legal - social - cultural  - ngos - media - trade unions - industry bodies(each sector has one) - govt unions, as soon an event occurs knowing who the contact person is and showing them what your group is planning and ways their orgs can get involved, will change peoples understanding of how our new networked society can respond to misuse of Power.

https://twitter.com/NrcProtest/status/1214091227475267584?s=09 Mods, please sticky this. We need more people to go out and fight fascism.  The point of relay protests is to maintain a continual, peaceful resistance without a reduction in numbers. To do this, people take turns to participate, rest, and rejoin, much like relay races.

Unlike rallies, relay protests usually take place at a fixed spot. People bring supplies such as food and sleeping bags to stay for long periods of time.

Relay protests are much more likely to attract media attention without disrupting peace and order. This is due to their long-term, continuous nature. People's determination and dedication to the cause shines through. Especially in cases like Shaheen Bagh, where the protests continued despite the nail-biting winters of the North through Christmas and New Year's.

Scheduled,Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,693,eogkmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/,345,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",VelvetHedgehog," People in the Northeast do not seem to have any dietary restrictions 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GLzuKz1fuQg

However, the problem arises when bigots and racists use this to demonstrate their ‘non-Indianess’ for in their logic such people could only be ‘Chinese’ If you want to see how Caste affects the perception of non-vegetarianism look no further than Tamil Nadu. The majority of the state is non-vegetarian. It has an incredibly developed Non-vegetarian cuisine. Ask anyone outside the south about the perception of Tamilians and its always vegetarian. Majority of the reason is because outside the state the vast majority of Tamilians working are Brahmins (especially in civil service), and most of the eateries outside the state are run by Brahmins. For those that don’t know, this is Dalit cuisine

Would you eat this? Perhaps if you were starving and nothing else was available to you? That is why these people started eating them! [removed] I’m not telling everyone to eat non-veg, beef or pork. I know the last two are unfathomable for most of us. However, those that want to eat them should have no restrictions. There never used to be any such laws before and this was the traditional diet of many communities Gai doodh nahi deti hai, hum usse le lete hai. Spot on. It's not like we are an animal or nature-loving society otherwise. It's all caste, masquerading as lifestyle choices. I belong to small backwards village in UP where we didn’t have electricity until a few years ago

Outside our village was a basti of the Chamars

They certainly did not eat lithi chokha unless it was given to them as leftovers. All they were entitled to eat was the leftovers of higher castes and they used to take the joothan of both Hindus and Muslims without discrimination. I am haunted by a moment when I was around 10 years old and ran after the ice cream cycle and bought an ice cream and I was greedily eating it like a pig while a boy the same age as me but from the Chamar community was staring at the ice cream and at me and I still remember the look on his father’s face. His father wanted to buy one for his son as well and went after the ice cream man. My mother told me to eat it away from them so that they cannot see and ‘najar nahi lagegi’ 

They ate pig and breed them and would sacrifice a pig every year to their caste god. They also ate the flesh of all dead animals. They ate lizards, jackals, mongoose I don't get the cow fascination most cows are domesticated so they grow up for sole purpose of feeding milk to the population so why get offended when people eat it I mean the cow served same purpose in both cases to feed people, I will never get the cow thing it's so stupid. 
My great grandfather(Brahmin) moved to West Bengal and since then most of our family members are non vegetarians but still beef is very sensitive topic. I hope someday we can see through this bs it's a domesticated animal people stop getting offended. I am sorry but you are using the words ""Indian"" and ""caste"" very vaguely. I am an upper caste Brahmin from the Bengal originally and there is no such restriction for any caste. In fact even the ""pujari"" eats non veg after doing puja, in fact he is fed before everyone else can eat. Also, same is the case in kashmiri shaivism and a lot of other tantric sects as well. 

It is only a few ""elitist"" brahmins (mostly vaishnavites). Who promote such ideas and should be looked down upon because they spoil the name of Hinduism. We are a very vast culture with many schools of thought we can't demean Hinduism entirely just because a part of it is very casteist. We need to learn, re-write and re-narrate Hinduism to the masses.

There is a lot of hindutva propaganda. But let's try to see though it and not kill beef eaters or look down upon meat eaters. 

PS: I did upvote because you started a great convo here. We need more and more diverse voices Just like everything else in india Such hypocrisy is ripe in India and I personally feel there is a need for drastic change that would make the society casteless and classless may be I’m wrong but it’s time for a change in mindset of people. Of course most people in this country don't actually care about animals. We all see and ignore the plight of street animals every single day. By that argument are Jains and Bhuddists also forcing vegetarianism ? Or is it only the Brahmins who are espousing vegetarianism on everyone. 

Kshatriyas were warriors and kings. They ate meat. So to say vegetarianism has to do a lot with casteism is being a bit dishonest. 

Indian cuisine is one of the few which organically has so much vegetarian food choices instead of just meat substitutes. It is sad that even that is used to fuel hatred on this sub. 

Hope you find peace OP. What is this? Bootleg scroll article? This write up is sprinkled with gems like,

>Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power **being forced on** the non-vegetarian majority – **with their consent**.

>The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

>The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity.

*Proof:* Assume theorem is true => Theorem is true now. Done<>

&#x200B;

There are many things wrong with caste, but vegetarianism isn't one of them. So vegetarianism is bad because of Brahmins? I feel nowadays caste based vegetarianism is like forced practice I have friends who belong to the swami caste yet they eat meat and stuff outside in secret and practice vegetarianism at home. This is pure BS.  

People are non vegetarian because that comes naturally to them and easily accessible. In today's world we don't even need to rely on meat as we can get majority of required supplements with veg counterparts and remaining can be found in eggs. Most Baniyas/Vaishyas are vegetarian. Kshatriyas have a high percentage of meat eaters. Any “ism” is more about moral superiority than the real thing. Absolutely. We're a hypocritical bunch with dung for brains. If we had the sense to look beyond Brahmin India, we'd see how people thrive with non-vegetarian food in their diets. It's beyond cringe to see our athletes against say, Australian or New Zealand athletes. When we moved to the UK initially we had the problem of halal haram coming from a Muslim family but later we decided to abandon these customs for a few reasons:

1. In this country you cannot see the animal being slaughtered, so you do not really know if it is halal and since most of the animals are stunned beforehand, it so not valid. Thus you cannot be sure of the provenance of meat even if it is from a halal animal

2. It is not convenient to be restricted to certain foods. We lived in a White British area and not some Desi ghetto where everything is halal or vegetarian. Most of the things I grew to like actually consumed pork such as sausages, pate,  etc. Which either my parents knew had pork but did not care or they really didn’t know

3. Islamophobia and also the mentality of most Muslims in modern times makes me want to distance myself from them

4. Me and my father, mother are technically atheist or agnostic, so why not eat pork?

5. I used to try to be vegetarian as far as possible but I love meat too much so it didn’t last long I'm an avid non vegetarian. I don't crave pork or mutton coz i much rather prefer the chicken-egg-fish combo.

If you have to bring it up to castes well even among the so called brahmins there are sub casts and I happen to belong to top of them. And in my entire region, across casts and whatever subsections you want to indulge in or care for, having the ability to have fish regularly is among the top prosperous blessings our ever so orthodox ancestors can bestow upon us.

While it's easier to chalk it up to caste. The choice and stigma of vegetarianism is more about the region and the kind of people who've rose to power in those regions from ancient times. But most of it lies with people who cling to unfounded beliefs in the name of ""culture"" and not having the sense or ability to question why things are so.

PS: pretty much any class of people have had access to and have consumed some section of non vegetarian food. Just go through the manuscripts from the courts of any kings and such you can get your hands on. Bengali brahmins eats fish. It has nothing to do with caste but everything to do with religion. Naturally some random beliefs might get right. Definitely nothing to do with compassion for animals either. BS ->
>As is common knowledge, 

Common knowledge is WRONG, all the time, not most of the times, all the times. 


>the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet

Wrong again, the mostly part is wrong as well as the entire sentence 



>, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously

Who told you? 



>is much higher than among those who are not from these communities

This proves nothing and helps in NO WAY to make the point you are trying to make. 



> The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians

This proves nothing, and you have no data to proof this, and you have not even defined the higher and lower. Your ranking of higher and lower is based upon an argument you tried to make before, which makes your assertion circular, ergo no signal but noise. 


> burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Who told you?  It is not a burden but a choice. Just because you cannot accept other women's choices does not mean your labelling of their choice as burden is correct. 




>of moral power of minority within Hindus

Wrong again

> be if they feel threatened by the introduction

Circular argument again, it's their choice, and it their right to protest. It is their right to PROTEST AGAINST THE THINGS THEY DO NOT LIKE. just because you do not like their rights and choices does not mean you are correct. Do not poke your nose into other's people choices and rights. 

> In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung

One who eats beef by slaughtering underage calf is NOT the same as one who eats beef of buffallows. 




The above write up a anti semitic and calls for voliance upon bhramins, just like the naxzis do and continue to do so. 




The tax paying citizen [ net + ve tax paying [ no reservation, no govt aided college and medicare ] ] is an asset, not a libilaity. [removed] Ambedkar also wrote about it in one of his books To clarify I am not against vegetarianism itself, it is actually a good thing but it is not good to force it upon poor Indians who have historically suffered great injustices and many still do. If you can afford to chose what you want to eat, that’s great but remember not everyone is able to chose. very true Unfortunately, in Hinduism, certain animals are considered more valuable than certain categories of humans. gohatya or slaughter of cows is a grave sin, perhaps only superseded by brahmahatya  or killing of Brahmins. Why are you replying to your own post.You can edit it. They say that non veg makes your mind dull (which is complete bs btw), to them, I say, Einstein and Newton weren't vegetarians.. I agree with your heading. In India vegetarianism is like that. But you are going too much extreme on other side and getting preachy . Let people eat whatever they want. This post reminds me of the L. K. Advani interview with his wife, where she blurted out that his favourite food was chicken hearing this Advani was visibly perturbed/embarassed and negging her to shut up. > ""People who committed big sins in past life, have been forbidden to enjoy tasty (non-veg) food in this life""

I use this to shut down any vegetarian who pretends to be morally superior as I much on my chicken/fish/beef/pork :) Bang on!

You forgot the main aspect that connects the caste system and diet - untouchability! 

I get people getting nauseated due to the smell. But there's whole different untouchability I have witnessed where the vegetarians don't want people eating non veg on same table to touch their food or even use same spoons. As if some minute particles of non veg are gonna spoil their purity.

And another mistake we do is restricting this discussion to Brahmins. The Jains are vociferously pungent about non vegetarians. Most of the shit non vegetarians receive comes from them! I sometimes wonder how every discussion somehow excludes the nasty practices of that community. I felt very much in two minds when I visited India as a vegetarian (vegetarian for ethical reasons). I was of course absolutely delighted to have so many options when it came to food, and it never felt like the food I had was prepared as an afterthought. In Western countries, you're sometimes lucky if there is one vegetarian option on a restaurant's menu, and that itself will often be ""Please ask your waiter"". This roughly translate as ""Ask us, and we'll go through the back of the fridge and maybe the peels from yesterday, fry up what we find, throw some soy sauce over it and sell it to you as stir-fry for €20"". So having so many choices and such delicious options was a fantastic experience for me.

However, when I chatted with my colleagues while there, I had more than one of them mention to me how some of their family members would use their vegetarianism almost like a weapon. One told me that he and his wife were no longer vegetarian, and consequently her parents had cut contact for years. Even after they had re-established contact, they would not set foot into the non-veg couples house for a long time. They now do come and visit, but the couple have to ""cleanse"" the house before the parents arrive, to make sure that there is no meat in the house at all. Not even powdered chicken stock. And no eggs in the fridge, either.

Another told me that an aunt of hers, when going out with the rest of the family to eat at a restaurant, will bring her own food. And she's only started doing that after not having had a meal with her family for years.

It really made me sad to hear about all this. Sharing food is such an important aspect of companionship, family and culture, and to break that so callously and brutally is beyond my comprehension. I really appreciate this post. It actually came up recently in another thread I was in. I like that you wrote this without criticising any one section. Vegetarianism in India is one of the great plagues forced upon the masses. If we could eat beef and pork and other meat then we would never go hungry. The Chinese eat everything, learn from them. They have survived some of the worst famines in history yet they are thriving PETA, celebrities and Westerners need to stop endorsing vegetarianism (and even worse, veganism) in a developing 3rd world country where most of the people suffer from hunger. It makes me sick when Westerners praise Indians for their non-violent vegetarianism. Sure, Indians can’t hurt cows but they have no issue lynching a human that supposedly ate one Fantastic points put forward. Vegetarianism is form of elitist thinking and lifestyle and it's also repressive. Live and let live, and let people eat what they want ffs. Ugh!
And the virtue signaling in social media.
Every single time when there is a forest fire, this same group couldn't stop posting about meat industry's 3% contribution to global warming.

I'm like.. 
Yeah? The forests stop burning if malnutrition becomes the global standard?

You don't eat meat because of your fucking scriptures you idiot, don't pretend like you care about the planet.

The same people do not care about anything else that is happening in India! From what I understand, the food choices do not just come on the basis of casteism. The lack of means to buy non vegetarian products has also been a factor driving many people towards vegetarian cuisine.

the same logic applies to the ingredients that going to the preparation of the food. For example, lot of red chili being used so as to hide/cloud the missing taste of other masalas which are rather expensive.

Your post maybe correct in criticising the old practices, but I believe people nowadays have less qualms about these things. Some people who were brought up vegetarian choose to stay the same and not because they despise the sight or smell or what have you. The ones who were closet non-veg eaters nowadays don't have a problem discussing the same with family. Well not exactly _discussing_ but still their family knows and sometimes they may joke about it.

I myself belong to vegetarian family, baniya Agrawal. My mom won't allow any of the non veg item being prepared inside. With Uber eats, at least we started to get the cooked items inside!
Anyway, she's finding it hard to allow eggs to be stored or cooked, even though given my diseases and high protein requirements it's essential. The _boomers_ have a little hard time in giving up old practices. If you replace that vegetarianism with English language in India and non vegetarianism with the desi languages we will reach the same conclusion , the thing is poor people always follow the rich people not the other way around Root cause is not caste hierarchy. Root cause is some principle behind a caste not wanting to consume meat. It's a stupid argument, comparing caste hierarchy to love for animals. You should rather compare the reason why certain castes want to follow vegetarianism. I wonder when people of kolkata are forced to try Jain/Marwadi Veg food Are you against animal agriculture or for it? I would like to make a new post now because at this point there are too many comments to reply individually so apologies for this. Also thanks for the silver!

Ok so title states that Indian vegetarianism has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals. That does not mean caste system is the reason for vegetarianism. I apologise if at any time I made it appear that way. Religion, region and availability of ingredients as well as economics are also very important factors 

I also apologise for hurting sentiments of anyone, in no way do I mock anyone for holding cow sacred, but the truth is that cows in India are sadly not thriving, most as seen on the road side are actually struggling to survive. We can argue that at least they are free unlike other countries where they are kept in poor welfare farms and abused for meat and dairy etc.

I am not against any community or caste, I am merely against discrimination, a lot of which is so deeply rooted in our society that we have been blinded to a large extent. I believe people should be able to eat what they want

The reason I posted parts of this article from 2017 is because it is still valid and the whole thing has some unnecessary details, otherwise I could have just posted a link to the original. I elaborated my own views and opinion in the comments 

As we can see society is changing and attitudes, not always for the better unfortunately 

Being Vegetarian is good but eating meat is not bad. Yes vegetarianism nowadays will benefit the environment but it not be forced on anyone. The poorest of the poor should have the right a balanced proper diet. They have historically eaten meat so it is unfair to take that away from them as well and advocate them to eat plant based substitutes, so much has already been taken away from them.

Peace and prosperity 

Bharat mata ki jai! Can anyone tell why specifically cow was chosen to be revered and not buffalo? I don't think this is a sound model considering that the fraction of meat eaters don't follow the caste hierarchy, I mean if Caste Hierarchy is Brahmins > Kshatriyas > Vaishyas > Shudras, then going by your explanation the fraction of meat eaters should be in the order of Shudras > Vaishyas > Kshatriyas > Brahmins, but it's more like Shudras > Kshatriyas > Brahmins > Vaishyas. I have seen a lower number of Baniya caste people who are non-vegetarians as compared to Brahmins.

Plus eating meat is more like function of how religious someone is (if meat eating is forbidden in the version of religion in their region), behavioral inertia, and economic situation. Expanding on the last one, Dalits of my village are pretty well to do, I mean you wouldn't notice when you enter lower caste neighborhood, so eating meat for them is not a matter of survival, and behavioral inertia and religious beliefs take over.    

Also I don't think we should be discussing this, because it is implicitly persuading people to eat meat. Currently nearly all meat is industrially produced which results in great suffering for the animals involved, is bad for health and have massive environmental impact. Beef is worst of all, especially the cattle reared solely for slaughter. 

A cow needs to be fed 20+ tons of food and even greater amount of water before it's ready for slaughter in two years, in the meantime it has produced 10s of tons of methane and carbon dioxide. Then you kill it to obtain a few hundred kilograms of meat. This is horrible conversion ratio of resources.  

We have raised cattle for generations, so take it from me that you need at least half acre land to support one cow. Now on one hand you ear mark half acre for two years and then you will get say 300 kg of meat, or you could grow 8 different crops in the meantime which will give you much greater amount of food products, and capture some CO2 in the meantime. I don’t see it as such a problem in Punjab. I suppose it’s because caste hierarchy isn’t as big of an issue as it is in other states. It’s an issue but not as prominent I think.

For **TLDR** scroll to the bottom of the comment (PART 2).

\-------

Vegetarianism is the natural course any civilization would follow in a country with the geographical conditions such as India's. And vegetarianism as a cultural phenomenon (religion, caste, etc.) is merely a consequence.

Let me explain this.

We have one of the most fertile plains in the world, created due to the the extensive river network throughout the subcontinent, the most prominent ones being the Indus river plains and the Ganga river plains (630 million acres) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic\_Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic_Plain))

For the climate that early Indians were exposed to, the terrain and the geographical conditions they lived in, agriculture was the most optimal means to feed the society. As a side note, agriculture and relative isolation is the main reason for such explosive population. The conditions were similar for china too. (This research paper illustrates the correlation between agriculture and explosive population growth ([https://www.nature.com/articles/16339](https://www.nature.com/articles/16339))

Now compare this with China.

China, like India has an extensive river network throughout the early Chinese civilization positioned on the east of Heihe-Tengchong line, where to this day, 94% of the population resides. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heihe%E2%80%93Tengchong\_Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heihe%E2%80%93Tengchong_Line))

China also has two prominent rivers, namely, Yellow river and the Yangtze river, which led to a network of multiple fertile plains, the most prominent being northeastern Chinese plain. This is also where the earliest Chinese civilization existed ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast\_China\_Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_China_Plain)) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow\_River\_civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River_civilization))

Agriculture, like in India, was naturally adopted in China too, given the climatic, geographical conditions of the country. This again lead to the explosive population growth in China, like in India. ([https://www.nature.com/articles/16339](https://www.nature.com/articles/16339))

Now, let's analyze the vegetarianism aspect of this situation.

Like India, China also had a long history of vegetarianism, mainly due to the agricultural development the civilization witnessed (This later changed, people did eat ""weird $hit""; Mongols have a significant contribution to meat eating culture in China, again, due to Mongolian geography). ([https://ivu.org/history/east/china.html](https://ivu.org/history/east/china.html)) Huan Tsang also notes that Indian upper castes were predominantly vegetarian. ([https://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson9/chapter03.html](https://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson9/chapter03.html))

Comparing this to non-agricultural civilizations (more appropriately, settlements and nomads) found mainly in central, western Asia, Europe and Mid-Africa, where agriculture was difficult, people resorted to meat consumption. The first meat production/culturing (NOT consumption; early Homo sapiens ate meat too but they weren't civilized yet) took place in western Asia, which then spread to central Asia and Europe. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#History\_of\_meat\_production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#History_of_meat_production))

Not only India and China, most ancient agricultural civilizations like East (China, Japan), South East, Mediterranean basin adopted vegetarianism. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_vegetarianism#Ancient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_vegetarianism#Ancient))

And before you claim that I'm upper caste hindutva guy and a bigot (like you've done in this comment section already), I'm neither of those. I’m not attacking any ‘caste community 
There is merely an evil mindset that must be changed for the sake of India. This evil has been going on for far too long and it will one day encompass all of us if it remains unchecked. Case in point, what is happening to our country today Da fuq ? Why is your post word-to-word copy of [this 2017 article](https://scroll.in/article/833178/vegetarianism-in-india-has-more-to-do-with-caste-hierarchy-than-love-for-animals) OP. Care to reply? If you look at the terminology we use

Pure veg 

Non-veg

These are unique to India

Pure veg apparently does not even include onions and garlic and masoor dal as well as mushrooms and more. It is basically the Sattvik diet. It includes yoghurt, milk, ghee, butter. Sometimes vegan tourists mistake pure veg for vegan but that is not the case. Pure veg is for the purest castes

Non-veg is unique to India because vegetarian is not considered the norm in other countries thus the term is not used. ‘Meat’ or protein is used instead Everything I have said is true. People downvoting my comments on this thread are either bigoted/prejudiced or content with ignorance and want to keep the lower castes oppressed [removed] I call this BS.I come from a vegetarian family, been one my whole life. Never witnessed any caste or religion based discrimination. India is too big for such broad generalizations, I can speak for North Indians (Punjabis, including Delhi) are mostly vegetarians and also the most cosmopolitan of Hindus and have the least level of discrimination based on caste, religion or race. I have second hand knowledge for rest of India, still the love, respect and acceptance of animals in India is impressive and admirable.

Whatever the reason may be how Hindus arrived to this but Vegetarianism is the future and the way to go. Vegetarianism and respect for all lives is only increasing in the world, it is actually one of the most important strategies to manage climate change and its impact. I know about 100+ vegetarians, except for the handful religious nutjobs, nobody cares about caste or ""purity"". 

Most vegetarians do not want meat because of the eek factor, the smell or death, the whole idea of boiling dead bodies and eating flesh is insane, disgusting and most importantly extremely disturbing.

Many people are asking how the bot stops fake news, so I'm copy pasting my explanation here -

There are two main scenarios:

1. You receive a WhatsApp forward which you know is factually fake and want to report it. You can forward the message to this bot and report it as fake, and leave a note as to why you think it's fake.

2. You receive a WhatsApp forward and want to check if it's genuine before believing it/passing it on. You can forward it to the bot, and the bot will inform you how many people have reported it as fake and their reasons for doing so

It was scheduled for a hearing and vote at 2pm today. It has been a long and emotional day. There were around 200-300 people supporting the resolution and probably not more than 80 who were supporting CAA and against the resolution. They were in minority but were the loudest and were there at the city hall since 7 in the morning. Since they were first in line, they got to register for the hearing first and got the opportunity to speak. [Here is the full video of the hearing and the vote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwygRQ6oXuQ)

One after the other they came and spoke lies about how CAA has nothing to do with Indians. They talked about how minorities are being prosecuted in Pakistan/Bangladesh, how women are being forcefully converted or raped in these countries, or how minorities went from 25% to 5% in these countries(without any source for that information). Some argued that Seattle should deal with its own problems of homelessness, drugs and crime instead of ""falling prey to hate-mongering"". One person even claimed that there is a [genocide of Hindus going on in India and the population of Hindus went down to 65%.](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=1920) Many people laughed at that. Some accused the council member Kshama Sawant and her political aspirations and her ""ulterior motives"" behind this resolution. Some even went on to claim that all these protests against CAA are sponsored by Pakistan/ISI. [And when there was finally a group to speak in favor of the resolution, the bhakts started heckling and shouting at them and the the hearing was suspended,](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=2798) which they knew would happen. When the hearing was resumed it was back to them and their lies.

After the public hearing, the council member Sawant [gave an amazing speech supporting the resolution](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=4463) and she was constantly being heckled. And then there was [this](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5106) comment from another council member who could see the bigotry through all the comments made by the bhakts.

In the end, truth prevailed and the council members voted 5 out of 5 in favor of the resolution. 

Right when it was apparent that the resolution was going to be passed, the bhakts started [creating a ruckus](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5574) and after multiple warnings, security was called and they were asked to leave the hall. The way the acted was embarrassing to say the least.",ali_sez_so," What is that going to do for us? Thanks for the detailed self-post. NRI Bhakts to boycott Seattle and Microsoft now! This is great news after the EU. Hope the SC would atleast think twice now before giving blow job to the Modi govt. OMG, the beeline of whatsapp University graduates sharing their whatsapp gyan with the council members is pathetic.

It is almost like they were forced outside of their zee news whatsapp bubble but never realized it and kept repeating their whatsapp chants. Thank you for the Summary OP. 

Were they chanting NM zindabad as they left the hall? Utterly Despicable. Well done, Seattle Council and well done all those who worked so hard to create and table this resolution. So uh, will the international pressure help?. What if they become even more authoritarian?. Thanks OP for the video link and TLDW. This was a good watch. Wish we had neutral courtrooms here. Also, I'm sad to see how propoganda has consumed highly educated folks all over the globe. If over they open their ears and minds to the other side of the story... These sanghi bhakts are the same everywhere innit. Spew lies, shout, disrupt and then blame everyone else apart from themselves. 

Good job for chronicling all this, OP. With bhakts, it's painfully evident that while they feel greatly for the persecuted minorities, their hatred for Muslims is much more in magnitude. A bhakt who is truly for the persecuted Hindu minority would have suggested inclusion of all religions so that relief for persecuted Hindus is expedited in the light of the protests. Of course BJPs doesn't give two shits about the persecuted Hindus. Their endgame is mostly WB polls where they stand to immensely gain if the Muslim illegals are disenfranchised ( who currently are part of the Mamta vote bank) UN should pass a resolution against CAA NRC. Impose sanctions, if required. Whatever it takes  the spirit of India must be saved. Nice to see the council focused on the real issues of the city. Always wondered why shit never got done in Seattle... thanks. Hasn't US, France and Israel supported CAA or my Facebook feed is broken? Again this only highlights biggest red flag with Muslims (there I said it, bury me) that religion > nation. Why are they talking about India in Seattle. They are just hacking the democratic processes and have misplaced loyalties. I want to see one passed against China. Bunch of hypocrites. It's like saying 'happy mahoram' to a Muslim.

Why do we do that! Why do we try to see the difference in one other.

Why is there even an idea of someone being superior by their birth.

How can someone think they have more rights than others.

Animals are better than this. Government must compensate the family, the best it can. Life lost. Casteism at its ugliest. This country will not Change in a million years. I don't even duckin care anymore. Bloody hell. Casteism is one of the very important reasons why India is so low in HDI and various other indexes. This is why we need **caste based** reservations This is so fucked up and the bad part is this is very near to my village (about 30Km) in Punjab.And I don't think this is casteism . It's a pretty peaceful and safe area. RIP. I tweeted few days back saying how dalits and other minorities facing discrimination and this ""girl"" commented dalits are not minorities and she is a dalit and i am fucking stupid because dalits are hindu and they are safe. This is fucking digusting, whoever did this should be sent to jail. The deceased was jat Sikh too right ?

So I’m confused - I thought there’s no casteism among the Sikhs Pains me ! Why oh why be so bloody stupid. Casteism  is getting more and more deep rooted in society instead of fading with the progress of education ,job options ,other digital information sources .There is an increase of tensions between different castes even on slightest poking by any  miscreants ,Lots of abusing you tube comments ,videos,Facebook status ,Whatsapp forward will instantly start to make things more worst.Only God knows when we will be out of this shit of killing each other based upon caste hierarchy and rank .

No body have right to kill anyone when we as a human do not have power to make alive anyone. Yet, the UC in this country have the audacity to question reservations. WTF? Feudalism is still alive and thriving in India. In another world this guy would've been a supermodel or something. Such is the lottery of birth sadly :(. WTF is wrong with people in Punjab! Modi doesnt care. This is messed up Godse did not assassinate Gandhi, it was an accident, I’m told. People believe what they want to. 
But you have a point, and the prosecution will have to prove the casteism allegation. Regardless, it is a heinous crime and must be punished severely. I do feel sad

Scheduled,Can Indians grow a spine already?,269,f2y883,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2y883/can_indians_grow_a_spine_already/,164,"I am so sick of Indian men and women being pressured into arranged marriages. I am sick of the whole virginity being the sacred bowl of purity, sick of aunties who will keep on nagging you to get married. This is absurd. 

Everyone puts up the whole, 'Arranged marriages are done with consent' bs. Are they though? Deep inside everyone knows that the majority of the Indian population is pressured into marriage. 

Let's see, if someone pressures you to have sex, it is *sexual assault*, right? It is a crime. You shouldn't be pressured into *anything*, not even marriage. I can't believe how manipulative parents can get, 'I will slit my wrists if you don't get married', 'You will see my dead face if you don't get married'. Here's the thing, taking your own life needs a *lot of courage*, trust me, I have tried. *Your parents won't take their own lives for this*. You are an adult, probably earning, you can take care of yourself and take your own decisions. *Please don't be pressured and ruin two lives*, hell maybe 3 lives, if we assume that you will have a child. I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course, and my life has been hell. I remember wishing that my parents never got married, even if it resulted in me not being in this world. 

Here's the thing, life's already complicated, you need to earn, do your job, take care of yourself and others, etc, why make life more difficult with things that don't need to be complicated. Socialize, date, make friends, find common interests, know each other for *years*, marry. That's how biology of the body is. 

Some say that arranged marriages have a courtship period, but how long does it last? The maximum amount of time I have seen someone just being engaged in an arranged marriage is 1 year. Not to mention, the courtships can be in an controlled environment and fixed meeting and schedules. How can you be sure your partner wants to marry? Hell, how can you be sure? Is it because *this is just the next step*? What if your sexual libidos, kinks don't match?
 I, for a fact know that I won't marry someone until I have know them for atleast 3 years! It's sad to see where the society is going. You can say that that's how the culture of India is, but does the culture have any value if it suppresses and unnaturalizes the whole concept of love and relationships, the way biology works? If it affects mental health? After all, isn't culture just man-made? Only the positive aspects of culture should be kept. Relationships, sex, love are natural. Nothing *sacred*. If you want arrange marriage, good for you, just make sure your partner has *actually consented*.

Sincerely, a rant by me. Seeing my dear best friend in depression after being emotionally blackmailed into a marriage with same threats of suicide, 'log kya kahenge', etc has been terrible. Know that parents are not Gods, they are humans whom you should definitely respect but they *do* make mistakes. Even if love marriage doesn't work, you have yourself to blame, not your parents and part in your own terms. If you are pressured into a marriage, how can you say that you won't be pressured to no divorce? 

Stand up for yourself.

Edit: This is amusing. I would like to point out few things,

1) I am not claiming that *all* arranged marriages are forced. I have just stated how forced marriages do happen. Some people have taken it personally.  *I just feel it is projection*.
2) Many people are denying this, but it happens. A lot. To the point that it is so normalized that you don't feel it. *This is not a village thing. The friend I mentioned is from Mumbai*.
3) The ""I am a virgin, I want a virgin"". Okay, good for you, it's just, I feel that you are insecure about yourself. Atleast, that's how it looks like to me, as  a girl. (Oh, I am a *virgin* girl, so don't come at spewing shit like, ""You had sex that's why you don't want virginity to be considered""). If not, tell me why your partner's virginity matters to you, if it's not insecurity. It's a preference? Well, why is it? I mean, given the trend in the comments, most of you want to marry for sex. Which defiles marriage in itself, which you claim is sacred.
4) if calling me names, saying I am a weak shit for pointing out the obvious things happening in the society *and denying that it happens* makes you feel better, well, you do you. Classic ad hominem. Oh, you can say that I am generalising, and you know what, maybe I am, because generalizations always have a bit of truth of the society in them.
5) ""I won't get a good looking girl if I don't have an arranged marriage"". Oh my, that is so shallow. Just like a girl asking for 6 figures is wrong, then so is you asking for a good looking girl. Don't cry foul that women want money and gold diggers when you are just as shallow as them. I guess the quote should go, 'Don't judge a person until it's time for marriage'.
6) MARRIAGE IS NOT A CONTRACT AND DEFINITELY NOT A PASS FOR SEX. If you are marrying just for sex,   you are pitiful. Screams lack of confidence in yourself. People need to work on themselves, you don't get things you want just by sitting and hoping to get it. Since, most arguments are from men here, I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets 'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to get sex, except here, it has a better name. 

Again, I would like to clear that I am against 'forced arranged marriages', though I am not a huge fan of the business like transaction of arranged marriages, what people want is none of concern. People have started bashing it as if I am totally against arranged marriage. Though, I have tried to counter the points which have been posted in defense of arranged marriage (and I didn't find them convincing). Though most of them argue about how arranged marriages are not bad, which I agree. *It's just how it happens here, is bad*. And I have tried to counter them too, though those have no relation to the whole point of the post. Which is how many are being forced into marriage and how it is so normalized in the present society.

Oof, formatting in reddit sucks. And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go. 

*Pretty ironic. A country in which romantic movies are usually the highest grossing, shuns love in real life.*

I am not going to reply anymore, I have tried to reply to every comment but now it has become exhausting. Have a nice day, everyone.",Zea-," I think bigger underlying issue is the idea of life isn't complete or you are not settled till the time you are married. I could be earning, financially and emotionally independent but for Indian parents marriage is end all be all to every existence. More urban parents are getting sort of okay with love or ""love-arranged"" but none is okay with idea of NO marriage. 
And standing up to them is like death with thousand cuts. It starts eroding your conscience.  arranged marriages give way to dysfunctional families but I have seen non arranged marriages being dysfunctional as well. As dysfunctional people attract each other that type of thing. #The average guys *wishes* he would find love. Counterpoint: Dating in India is dominated by players, scammers, blackmailers and entitled ones who throw acid if they dont get what they want. There is no place for civility here.

tl;dr: Dating in India is asking for trouble. Counterpoint. 

The women i want to be with arent the ones always available to date. 
The ones available to date are the ones i have ZERO interest in.


Contrary to r/india, arranged marriages arent always doom and gloom. Especially if they are arranged- love marriages. They are probably the best. Arranged marriages are the only reason why some men in our country get a woman to marry them. Yeah, grow a spine and like and do as one likes. There is no need that only 1 way is correct.

&#x200B;

I went for arranged marriage as there are many factors in place for me.  If one loves someone he can do love marriage, some one likes live-in. Do it.

&#x200B;

In any case, anything can happen. People get depressed after love marriage also.

&#x200B;

And I personally don't think that it's the case of who one can blame after things go south. . Becoming an adult means that you can make a decision and you have to live with it. Dating is risky in india..only safe dating options are in college or workplace. Lot of scamners out there. Arranged marriage is the only route  for people not finding a match at these places..these days most profiles on matrimonial sites are managed by girls only so i dont see how it is any different from any other dating app.regarding courtship  3 years is a bit too much time to understand and then reject a person especially if you are nearing your 30s. Most Indian guys lack the social skills and/or social capital to get into relationships. There's also the skewed ratio at work here, coupled with the fact that girls are highly and in some cases violently discouraged from being in relationships. I'd say it's a cultural flaw - arranged marriages have been the norm for centuries, we never developed the social skills to maintain romantic relationships before marriage. The majority, which either doesn't know how to talk to the opposite sex, or can't, has only one chance at a relationship - through Arranged Marriage. Which is a hit or miss, with no way to undo what has been done. Can Indians grow a spine, or do you lack the said object yourself op? Seems like a big whine. 
If you have a problem with arranged marriages, just don't do one. People don't usually date in small towns and villages. And they have their right to remain a virgin before marriage.

And yes it's your friend here who has to grow a spine and stand up for himself. Marriage is not compulsory. Only if you find a person worth living with, all your life. Totally agree.  Way too many idiots  in our country who haven't really grown up into independent men and women. The arranged marriages is merely a systemic escapism from having to make hard and tough decisions by themselves. Its the classic outsourcing strategy. [removed] Counter point : Arranged marriage gives an average looking (ugly) desi guy (who invested in academics) a shot at getting a decent looking girl. 

Love is all emotional stuff but getting ""arranged married"" is a transaction \>   I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything  and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets  'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to  get sex, except here, it has a better name

While *Forced Marriages* are obviously bad ,the idea of confused shy young guys getting a bride by their parents for sexual gratification might seem selfish initially ,there's a lot of good things that happen as a consequence if the bride and groom consent since both achieve sexual gratification which is necessary at a young age and most people in India cannot find partners through love marriages since it isn't in our culture.

Also it makes certain youngsters both boys and girls responsible and gives them direction.I'm not even saying that only the husband works . Both may work and raise children together.

Its not a perfect process and there will be  disagreements when the going gets tough,that's why consent of both is so important. With consent the marriage is more likely to be successful than a love marriage since they've already made a decision before marriage to live their life with a person without rose tinted glasses  so they've (ideally) seen things which lovers wouldn't have or tend to ignore

\>  Oof, formatting in reddit sucks

In mobile . Not on PC

\>  *A country in which romantic movies are usually the highest grossing, shuns love in real life*

Not necessarily if you consider the amount of love marriages in this environment.

Plus look at the number of inter caste and inter religious marriages in the time of open bigotry

And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go

There are genuine problems with how arranged marriages are done in the subcontinent

The caste factor,skin color ,dowry and business and family relationships (groom and bride) often overtake actual marriage requirements of the boy or girl. This is a social evil and transcends every religion Of course they can not. They have a 'Good Guy' image to maintain, which usually translates to just obeying your parents blindly and staying away from unpopular opinions! Shit is engraved so deep, the practitioner doesn't get a whiff of it, irrespective of how smelly it is. People who are being forced into arrange marriage do need to step up. But if the person in picture is not against then everything is alright. who is this clown to say one year isn't enough just because he takes 3 years to decide? My way IS RIGHT NOT YOURS HURR DURR!! Yeah, obviously you know people better. Everyone around is simply being assaulted all the time, forced into arranged marriages and they have no say in it.

Seriously, where do such notions even come from? Have you tried talking to people around you? Most young couples I see in arranged marriages have had their wishes respected and are perfectly happy with their partner. It is only in the villages and in some families with issues where forced marriages happen.

Not every arranged marriage is forced marriage and harboring an opinion like makes you a cultural bigot. A strong disagree here.  I think one has to be realistic and practical about this. Op probably has an environment where everyone dates for years before marriage. Personally, if a young bloke asks me for advice on thks, I'd simply tell him that if they are already in a (physical) relationship with a woman and they like them, marry them by all means as and when they mutually agree. But if the chances of winding up with a gf are bleak (either because of lack of opportunity in a skewed gender environment or lack of a non-ugly face) , then LISTEN to the damn aunty and get arranged marriage once you have a job. In the hope for a Bollywood like romance, watching yourself become the third, fifth ... (2k+1)th wheel over time  will only kill you from the inside.  
And things like ""sexual compatibility"" are first world problems. It's when people are already getting a lot of action and want to optimize it. For a common Indian bloke, any bandhi is better than his right hand. 
I used to be like you: woke and arranged marriage basher during my younger years. But I've come to realize that idealism has its limits. In the end, in life, the rules are set and everyone plays by them. >virginity being sacred bowl of purity

A virgin would prefer a virgin partner. Nothing wrong with that. Those who've lost the V-card are free to ask for a partner ""*who knows what to do in bed*"".

Also, arrange marriage helps people get laid at least. A guy with a good future and a girl with a clean past get the most out of this system. That's the reality. 

Bring in the downvotes. At last someone spoke on the reddit what I usually keep saying to my friends. Exactly! The whole system is so rotten that it has no value left. [deleted] Good rant..
It's not as black and white as we would like it to be...some people are happy after an arranged marriage...so be it...

Both sides win.. Move out the minute you start earning and don't look back. Raise a good family (or not) on your terms. Unfuck the ""culture"". This is the only solution. It's a social issue. It's not really limited to family level. It's not even a marriage. It's a transaction. Beauty/wealth is exchanged for wealth. It's all about matching standards. It's a shitshow to be frank. The courtship posts are funny af. I live in a state which has one of the highest suicide rates among youths. We don't have the normal Dalit, Hindu, Muslim communities but even in our indigenous communities inter-cast marriages are looked down upon. I've lost 2 friends and a relative who were being pressured to marry someone they didn't like or had been separated from the person they eloped with by the families.

The seperations are normally aided by the police but it has to be done since most(ones I've witnessed in my locality) cases the lovers are not at the age recommend for marriage. India also needs to rid itself of the caste system. The biggest blockbuster next to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was Hum Aapke Hai...Kaun?. Around 80% of the movie was an Indian arranged marriage process from scratch. It is a Dummy #101 sort of thing if anyone wanna research. Then the rest 20% of it includes, pregnancy news, baby shower big party and baby welcoming bigger party, the wife gets killed off, husband set to marry his sister in law so she can take care of her deceased sister's baby. But in the end love conquers all when a Pomeranian dog spills the beans about secret relationship between husband's brother and the said sister in law. Happy ending, now love cum arranged marriage process begins.

Most of the parents you have today have come from those era and put a trademark that this is how marriages must happen. It has nothing to do with relationships, it's just how big of a wedding ceremony it was for a family. How much jewellery the bride wore, how many hours she spent on make up and dressing, did the groom threw a lavish Haldi party (usually means booze, chicken and dance), how big of a tent was created, etc etc. Every Indian parents see that future for their children and feed this idea into them. They don't teach them since young how to look out for yourself, what you should seek or how to lead your own self. They just teach their kids how to be like them in the marriage. And that's not always a pleasant thing to observe till you grow up. It is so sad that people are being forced into this ""normal life""

I've seen a lot of people get married or engaged recently and its mostly a really unhappy affair for them. I also have older friends in their 30s and 40s and most of these unhappy marriages will turn into divorce or infidelity, like they have right now.

Parents are only concerned with what the society will think/say. Thankfully I've convinced my parents that marriage is my choice and they have no role to play in the decision and they've backed off although the taunts do come sometimes. Still it needs to be forever remembered that it is my life and my decision. Fuck the world and fuck the society. Years of patriarchy and female infanticide has left us with a skewed gender ratio.

This skew gets  progressively worse as you go up the education ladder, since ""zyada padh likh legi to isse shaadi kaun karega"". So its not like the urban educated working class is spread out in an equal ratio and they should just pick a match for themselves - the ratio is badly skewed, something like an 80-20. This works great for the 20 girls who were fortunate enough to have progressive parents, since now they have a pool of 80 guys to pick from.

But the remaining 60 guys have no options in their peer groups or circles. So they get matched with Tier 2 Tier 3 city girls through this system of ""Arranged Marriage"" simply because there is no way they would cross paths with these girls without the intervention of relatives who work as ""arrangers"" in the arranged marriage system.

Lets not jump the gun and vilify the institution of arranged marriage, we need to focus on and eliminate this deeprooted patriarchy from our society to enable more women to get out and study/work and that financial independence goes a long way towards your parent's acceptance of your decisions about your own life.

If guys and girls were out and about in equal numbers, hardly any matches would need to be fixed by family members. they would have time and opportunity to find the right match and evaluate his/her marriage potential on their own.

Also a lot of the onus lies on you and me. Our parents are so used to having their way when it comes to our life choices that they just assume it is their right to decide our future here aswell. Stand up for yourself a little earlier in life, start taking decisions for yourself, learn to say no. Not just for the heck of it, but where it actually matters.

And besides, I do not know anyone who REALLY wanted to marry someone give up on the relationship because of parental pressure - all the quitters you see around you are just people who were on the fence about it and use parental pressure as an excuse. If you DO NOT want to get married, nobody can get you married (barring some extreme cases where the family's psychotic). If you give in to emotional drama then you are yourself to blame. Marriage is a crap shoot irrespective of whether it is a love marriage or not. It's lottery of life.... Laughs in naati and pota Laughs in die alone. I know I'm not gonna get anyone to like me, let alone that love bs and that is why I don't want to get married. I hope my parents will understand. > I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course

I never though i'd use the fake internet currency to award someone, but take it, this post deserves it.

I too come from same bg as you. On the good side, my parents are individually honest and good people at heart, but together they make a horrendenous couple.

There is 0 understanding, 100% dominance, 0 romance. My mom avoids going out with father, we don't have outings and have total **0** movies watched together. I cant remember the last time we dined together, or had a conversation together. I'm not on good terms with dad, so we avoid eye contact or talk unless absolutely necessary.

Don't get me wrong, my mom loves my dad and dad loves mom but only because its their responsibility and were forced into marriage. They are just like your father and mother, caring, loving, sacrificing, but as a couple, as a family, I would have preferred them divorced.

There is a myth we see in movies that after arranged marriage, as time passes, everything settles down, in our case it didn't. It only got worse.

It affected me so much that I, at a fundamental level don't understand or feel anything family related. Moms bday ?? cool, idc. Anniversary? idc. Somebody's wedding and if I dnt attend they'd cut ties off ? cool, idc.

I hope I'm explaining it correctly, but remember the feeling you get when its a special day for your loved ones ? maybe its their bday or they got a promotion ? the happiness you feel ? I just don't get it regarding family.

People think I do it for attention and they find it literally impossible to comprehend that a son could not feel anything for family. I don't give any explanation and it translates for them into 'edgy wannabe guy'.

The saddest part I felt was, My grandmother, with whom I lived from 1st to 10th because parents left in morning and came at night, when she died. I held her in my arms and I felt **nothing**. I was more petrified by the feeling that 'why am I not crying, why am I not feeling sad?' it was like a strangers death for me.

The second time where I considered counselling is when my dog of 12 years died in my arms (he was already sick) I was with him during his last moments checking for heartbeat. He left this world, and I did not feel sad. I was again feeling petrified over not feeling anything, it was just like a strangers death.

This is how my family fuckup has made me. If not for my close friends and exes and current gf, I dunno where I would have been. ties to family here are very strong and parents want to be part of their children’s lives compared to the west, where you get complete freedom to do whatever you want. So obviously they want “best” for their kids which includes finding a paramour.
That usually means finding someone that’s socially acceptable to them and their own family on parameters such as caste, status, features, reputation, etc.
It never includes anything that you may desire so shut up and get married or carve your own way in life with no one to question you. Ah you echoed my thoughts because I am going through it. I am turning 27 in May and my parents are losing their shit, that I have to marry ASAP, but I have complete clarity in my mind that I won't marry a stranger. I have indicated to my family that I would want to marry someone I know well enough, but the problem is that I am not dating anyone so that option can't be exercised either. 


The thing going my way is that I pay mine and family's bills, and I will have to more or less pay for my own wedding, so they can only pressurize, not force, and I have a pretty good spine lol. Very true,I am 27 and being a secret agnostic/atheist from few years I always get the thought of why we need to get married and have kids, are we so dumb that knowing how much struggles we face days to day and still we give birth to a kid and expect them to get over it in future.

Has anyone ever directly benefited by the scheme? Funny, FAQ Q18 reads as 'since a large number of requests are received seeking financial assistance for medical treatment, it is not possible to accommodate all requests due to limited resources.'
Limited resources? They had 570.68 crores in surplus from just one year? 
Also it is mentioned that the balance amount(which are significant surplus since 2011-12) is ""invested"" in various forms with scheduled banks and other agencies to ensure long term sustainability. So, about 75% of last year's funds are ""invested""?

Any help is really appreciated.",throwayaForRandia," Tell them what you feel., try and understand the trigger points.. As someone battling SAD and depression id recommend you go to a psychiatrist instead. Psychologists can't prescribe meds and I feel meds (not anti depressants or sedatives) can improve the condition a great deal.  And in my opinion meds should be the first linen of treatment.

Having said that, psychologists can offer CBT which can also help SAD and other mental afflictions. I would suggest seeking both treatments but if that's overwhelming then please consider going to a psychiatrist first Just be completely honest with them.
Don't worry about any judgement or such things  Be honest and speak what you feel your perspective etc. If they want to give you tablets ask them if you can be treated without it .
All the best 🙂 Type your life story so far on a page and hand it over to the psych\*ist. They can read it and gain an initial understanding better this way.

Scheduled,TIFU by being from a Scheduled Caste but apparently not looking like one,342,7jhqsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jhqsa/tifu_by_being_from_a_scheduled_caste_but/,264,"Sorry for the dramatic title. Also as TIFUs usually go, this did not happen today but over a period of a month

A little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.

So I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.

I checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.

So within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:

1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is ""highly interested"" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.


2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - ""hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?"" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. 


3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, ""I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number"". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- ""ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste"". Never heard back from her.


There are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. 

Now I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites. It's been a great learning experience about my position in the society folks! :)",whiteobsidian," You’re actually saving yourself from getting into a family of hypocrites. Not really a fuck up.

Good luck! I thought caste no longer existed in cities /s

Funny how the OBC girl was open-minded... for the castes above her.  OP, just invite me to your wedding, that's all I care about.

PS: I'm from okayish caste, not too high, not too low. Any caste generally means that they are okay with people of higher caste contacting them.  So ""open minded"" is my caste plus caste considered above mine. Matrimonial sites are hilarious and sad. 

just a thought, you are still 27 why hurry?  There was a gilded comment by a black guy a few days ago that said that he really appreciated when the bullets dogdged him for a change.  This is the same.  Unfortunately Indian matrimonial sites is just online aunty network without the aunties. There will be the same BS except it's online. 

Take some time out and start dating. In the grand scheme of things, finding the right person is as important as JEE. * **Any caste** means **any equal or higher caste**

Educated ""modern"" broad-minded Indian _hypocrites_.

OP, you dodged a bullet with every one of those.

Marry a girl who, as they say, ""loves you at your worst"". You are lucky you got matches. My friend (bengali upper caste) from IIM didn't get any matches when he didn't mention caste in his matrimonial profile 5 years ago. This is what modern day un-touchability looks like >  IIM passout

> working in a well known consulting firm 

>earning about 30LPA

> sincere, hardworking, simple dude

>Got 99.4 %ile in CAT

> AIR in 600's general in IITJEE

>Telugu 

*stops reading* IIM does not teach you that Indians are hypocrites of the first order? SC guy here, top educational institution and worked for top companies but not an IIT/IIM guy.

When I got married, the first line of my profile was I am an SC, dont believe in Reservation that benefits only the creamy layer. Rest of the stuff, I was very transparent about what I was looking for - a no-nonsense girl who is non-hypocrite, non pretentious humanist. Caste/religion no bar.

Got fair number of interests from inside and outside my caste. It was hard to see people with matching academic background from an SC caste. The non-SC interests I received were mostly from other religions.

Married to a no-nonsense unpretentious smart girl, her parents are from a brahman + other religion mix. A couple of my close friends who married within their caste have said they wished their married life was as stable as mine, after interacting with my wife and me for a while.

Hang on dude. Fuck this shit. I'm so tired of people acting all ""modern"" on the outside and being a casteist, hater on the inside. This is just ridiculous. 

Dude hugs man. I mean what can I say, just know that if someone asks you your caste they're not worth your time.  [removed] [deleted] [deleted] Lesson no 1. Those who developed a thinking that girls are some magical creatures and are very innocent and caring should know that they are human and just like men are in general shitty. Also given the chance they can act even worse than men and they do.

Lesson no 2. जात कुछ जाती नही

Caste never goes away.

Women at the time of arranged marriage will prefer someone from their caste only no matter how ""open minded,Liberal or progressive they claim to be""

The reason for this? All those lables are to fit in socially and nothing else.

Lesson no 3. Everyone's hypocritical. Some will admit maximum won't. That doesn't change the fact.  Shaadi ka laddu  ouch. some people just suck, OP.  This is just sad.

As much as I hate to say this, you should mention your caste on matrimony sites cos ppl do judge you based on caste and this unfortunately is the reality of India. Better to keep the hypocrites at bay. 

My parents had an inter-caste marriage. That being said, it is a fact there are differences in upbringing (type of food, type of interests etc.) and general attitude/mentality of people ( pet peeves, biases, dinner convos etc.) of families belonging to different castes. This isnt that big a deal if the couple plans to stay away from parents and love each other enough to get over the differences in mentality. But these differences cause a lot of issues when the couple decides to stay with either set of parents. Especially for the wife. I know my mom suffered a bit in her early days since she is from a lower caste compared to my dad, similar thing happened with one of my aunts. My dad stood by my mom and both of them were working and earning so things worked out eventually, my aunt ended up divorcing my uncle.

An upper caste friend of mine married an SC guy and her parents all but abandoned her, her husband's parents were somewhat accepting but issues did creep in over the years and now the couple are staying in a different city.

My advice would be to find a girl who is willing to relocate and not overly attached to parents/family or someone who has stayed abroad or has had a parent who has worked/stayed abroad. In those scenarios the caste issue will likely get diluted Whoa, from Tinder directly to a matrimony website? [deleted] You are being honest in India, mate. Won't work unless she is 1 in a million, who literally doesn't care. 

Ride solo instead. 🤘 i don't know if its true for most grills , but All of the grills i know never married below their so called ""caste strata"", but i know many guys who have relationships/marriages without a fuss about this. All the best OP, you will find a wonderful bride. Till then collect stories to publish a nice entertaining book. it shouldnt be TIFU but the others who f****** up by rejecting you based solely on caste. Good for you... I suggest leave this AM madness and look for someone who actually likes you!  So even a guy earning 30 lpa with IIT-IIM tag can't get over his caste when it comes to marriage 

Why are you not marrying within your community though ??  Damn! That is really sad to read. This must be really hurting for you.
I am SC too and nowhere near OP's financial and education status. I guess, I should start worry about marriage now. 

 I don't get the fuss around castes. I don't know the caste of my ex, I don't know the castes of my best friends, and I couldn't even be bothered to ask. It's an irrelevant label given to people that people don't even get to choose! Telugu people are casteist AF, no ? even here on randia caste feelings about marraige are pretty strong, people got triggered when sometime back i had suggested (after ambedkar) that people should marry outside their caste for eradicating caste system. but seems that caste runs too deeply in the indian psyche Wow i never knew caste is such a huge issue even in urban  areas. I know for a fact that I'm OBC (because 10th board forms. Never knew what my caste is), but I never knew what my exact caste is, since we never used the reservation. 
This discrimination is just saddening. Thank God I'm gay! >Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE.

Go to Europe. Get cool job. Get white girl. They don't know what SC is. why not post this on /r/tifu thread? i mean a lot of foreigners comming here to experience religion should know what they are buying into. What you're facing is ""did not read the instructions carefully"". Indian people don't read instructions on a hazardous item also. Let alone a marriage profile.

And like others have said -- (though you are wasting time), you are saving yourself from hypocrites. This is sick. I hope you find someone good yourself than through this arranged marriage business. Good luck. Such is reality. But keep an open mind and don't give up and weeding out the assholes is easier at this phase than at a later stage -from a person in a similar situation as you Wow ! Great(?) experience, keep track of your experiences till you meet your wife and write a book. One day it can become a movie ! :) This is the saddest thing I have read today. What the fuck people.  Caste is well alive even in urban India. No matter what you get or achieve in your life, you will be always judged by your caste and color. Nothing can change this mentality. I think it happens for your good, can you imagine marry such narrow-minded girl? You saved yourself bro. keep trying on tinder! Lol see the down votes. 
Good Luck OP but I think 27 is too early to get married. Haha this is so funny and so fucked up. ""Incredible india"" This is so sad and disturbing if narrated events are True. I can understand if less educated villagers are caste conscious but highly educated professionals from Metro have such mindset? Shocked and appalled. Perhaps, I was mistaken that people get enlightened with education. [deleted] caste system can't be broken by sustaining the system. you have anyway rejected the reservations that you were provided, for which i respect you. so, i don't see why you should still be hanging onto a demeaning label that somebody else gave your ancestors. just make up a caste of your own and don't call yourself an SC. as far as i know, there is no law preventing you from creating a caste of your own. My best friend a SC is dating a Brahmin. I remember her mother found out and she told her he will never marry you, no higher casts would accept a SC daughter-in-law. Her mother was right. My friend is the daughter to two civil servants. Still this is the status quo.  So no one is talking about 30LPA. OP sorry for your condition, but being a dick that I m, would like sharing your CAT prep strategy.

Obligatory caste notification, Dont know the caste but I m a fucking Tribal  from Bihar and do look like one.

EDIT : Also do invite me to your wedding if you dont mind a tribal in your wedding If you don't mind me asking kaun jaat ho? I mean which caste?

Why I am asking is because most northies including Maharatrians won't know the Telugu caste hierarchy unless you tell them. 

So you can either say bluntly that you are SC or you can tell them in a softer fashion that your caste is classified as SC but it isn't comparable to northie hierarchy and also highlight your own achievements. I mean soften the blow.

Now I am going to  be criticised for what I said above as it's playing the caste game and not taking the high road. However caste is a reality. Also you have chosen arranged marriage route so you can't escape it. Also your own post starts with claming you aren't stereotyptocal SC and you want to play up that card.  Soceital attitudes that makes one cringe. Racism (Skin-color), casteism, or communalism (religion) - these attitudes are programmed into us by an earlier generation , consciously or unconsciously. Its our choice if we want to *work at* eliminating them from our psyche - these are like layers of an onion - impossible to cast off in one go.  

Being in contact with diverse people can of course speed up the unlearning. You're fucking better off bro. You're killing it professionally (and you can only go up from here) and you're obviously intelligent and well educated. I'm not saying this to lift your spirits or whatever, you don't need that shit. What I'm saying is, if these people want to cling to archaic bullshit, let them. They may think you're beneath them but they're wrong. You outclass them by far. You do you bruh. I will die alone someday because I am of lower caste too minus the IIM pass out and fat paycheck stuff.

I once passed out in front of a college so I guess that counts :D Dude, what do you expect in India? It's uniformly hypocritical. Live and learn, I guess. **becuase there is a caste system , there's so much of reservation** 
Now , why do you want to curb down the 49% that the general category has ? 
I'm against the part where they allow them to take a general seat . 
I know reservation can't be eliminated fully , atleast not in the near future  Matrimonial sites are cancer. Avoid them at all costs. It's better to get fixed by relatives. Maybe I don't really understand the issues of the SC/ST but why would you actively identify with something that has kept you and your people down for so long? You could have just said you were buddhist and have lived without a caste for the last 3 generations.

You could have been happily married by now OP but instead you would rather everyone know that you're part of a victimized subjugated interest group. > I figured I was ready to get married.

How ya figure that? long time no sex? I wanna know coz me 26.  You have worked hard for everything in life, work a little bit more for that SO, who accepts everything from you.  Teli? Isn't that Jewish? You got jebaited.... :/ Bullet dodged like Neo from the Matrix, OP! Congrats and good luck in your spouse-hunt! As far as my experience goes - Even girls who are 'liberal' (  fuck around) mostly end up with with guys from their own caste only  Arranged marriage is a fucked up process, OP. If it is any consolation, I'm from an upper caste and I explicitly mentioned that I don't give a fuck about caste on my matrimonial profile only to face rejection from both upper and lower castes. 
I was dumped by my gf of 2 years the moment her parents found out I'm a different caste and went on to emotionally blackmail her. Mind you, her caste is lower than mine. She even had this super liberal JNU feminist personality facade about her. Imagine my heartbreak when she jumped on the first opportunity to get hitched to an UPSC job guy her parents introduced to her. Her parents' main objection? My caste. IIM is one caste i like. haha. Can i send my matrimonial page link for you to check? Let meknow [deleted] You said you never used reservation. Here's a take on why people don't : when you're eligible in the general category too , you use  the 'general' seat so that a seat in reservation remains empty , so someone else who got a lower rank can get that benefit. That's how general seats get eaten up. That's not something to be proud of , actually !  > lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE

For non reserved candidates, that just makes it worse... putting salt on a wound. >AIR in 600's general


So you chose not to pick a better course at a better IIT using your quota? If you didn't, you're stupid. If you did, you did actually make use of the reservations benefits


There's no need to be this smug and patronizing. Marriages are social contracts, it involves adapting yourself to your spouse's family/culture in varying degrees. If someone's not fond of a certain group of people, ofcourse theyre not going to marry into that caste. 

Also, different castes have different track records with status of women. So if an upper caste woman refuses to marry a guy from a largely illiterate lower caste, it is very much understandable since chances are very high her freedom is going to be severely curtailed. Did you find any girls who were fine with your caste but felt family wont approve? Did you suggest any to try to discuss about your caste with their family?  Which IIM ? When did you pass out?

Scheduled,"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.",11,fkql7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fkql7h/askindia_fathersmothers_of_reddit_india_what_were/,5,"Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories.",2throwawaythrowaway," OP, post this in r/TWOXINDIA as well. https://www.babycenter.com/childbirth-class has all you need to know about child birth. Regarding centers,city,hospital, I don’t know. India C section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors. Most cases natural birth is possible without much medication. 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication. 4th one (actually our 2nd) she took epidural. 1. Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.
2. 3 is average and is by no means overweight.   
3. Cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated. I was checked every hour when I went in while in labor (about 3-4 times). Ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress.
4. Any bleeding in late term, even if it's due to cervical examination needs to be monitored. Unless the doctor did a membrane sweep, there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity I guess.
5. I had a cervical check a day prior to my labor (I was at week 39 and very close to my due date) and I had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night. I woke up with back pain after midnight and I just knew this was it. Went to the loo, water broke, told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents. Waddled to hospital 2 hours later after I timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart. 
6. High risk and multiples. Also Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women (I was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof).
7. Only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india don't have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push. 
8. None. I was birthing at my home town. So I chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as ""google"" led. Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala but I'm of the ""give birth in hospital"" opinion as I don't know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies.

### So this is my situation


I on the last round of interview for an Irish company. And I don't have a passport yet ( I know it's dumb ). So I applied for the passport and went to the passport office today and my application got rejected due to the lack of identification documents.

I went there with 3 docs. Aadhar, pan And my sslc certificate.
I only have Aadhar, and pan card as identification docs. ( I have voters ID but the name in there is spelled wrong ). So the mam at the counter told me if there is any other documents I have, and suggested that I can get a online birth certificate. So I went to the near by Cafe and took a print out of the birth certificate. 

But in that, my name was given with out my initials. So the Assistant Passport officer rejected my application. 


So when I went back to ask what else I can do . The mam at the counter told me that if I applied for non tatkal passport I will need only two identification documents ( plus sslc certificate ). 

So I came back home and went to nearest *E-seva Kendra* to reapply for the passport in  non tatkal way.

## problem 2

Imagine my name is *Michael Jackson Obama*

So in my sslc certificate my name is written as *Michael JO.* And in my Aadhar and pan card it's written as *Michael Jackson Obama* . So he says that I cannot apply passport like this. I have to change my name in the sslc certificate to match my Aadhar. 

*Q1:* But the passport officer didn't mention any of these. Is that. Problem ? 

Changing my name in my sslc could take up to a couple of weeks. But if it takes that long I could lose my job.

I currently don't have licence. 

*Q2:* what are my options for getting a passport ASAP. ?


**Edit :- 10/03/2020**

I went to meet my uncle's friend who has some knowledge on these things. 

So I have been told that there will be no problem for me to apply passport via non tatkal route. 
Since my name on the PAN card and Aadhar is just expanded form of my name in the sslc certificate. So that won't be a problem. Appointment for the passport office has been scheduled at 16th March so I will post what happens next.


**Edit :- 16/04/2020**

I finished the interview in the passport office with out any trouble. They asked me which name I want in my passport. **Michael JO** or **Michael Jackson Obama**. So the whole process was over under 45mins. So waiting for police verification now.",fun_egg," Sorry for this, unethical suggestion,

Contact a broker. He will take some extra money and get the job done.

He might charge you extra to get the name changed in Aadhar and PAN according to your SSLC certificate.

Brokers have contacts who can get things done with as few requirements as possible. Hey man. I have a similar problem. I asked about it here a while back. You can check on my profile.

I haven't applied for a passport yet but I got an affidavit published in the state gazette that both my names on Aadhar card and SSC certificate are the same. So I'm gonna use that when I do apply.

Would you mind if I DM you after a while about if and how your problem is solved? Be **very careful**. There's lots of red tape bureaucratic rules such as

- [bring Aadhar photocopies of neighbors] (https://twitter.com/SivramSD/status/1214881303797149697)

- [Bring one Government employee with his/her service card](https://twitter.com/saprativa_b/status/1228611661877018625) What about your birth certificate? IIRC, Aadhar and birth certificate is sufficient for passport.  
Getting birth certificate edited would be much faster than editing SSLC certificate. Michael Jackson Obama, creative.  

Btw, you're gonna get into trouble during NRC if you don't have enough documents and names are spelt incorrectly.

Scheduled,Appreciation to Maharashtra Government,17,fl8lmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fl8lmk/appreciation_to_maharashtra_government/,23,"Read the post-script if you feel that I am wrong at any line. (Post Script is at the end)

I am neither related to any political party nor I want to support or say bad about any Political Party. This post is just to appreciate Maharashtra Government and to give reason for people in Maharashtra to support the Government to fight against Coronavirus.

The steps that Maharashtra Government took to fight against Coronavirus may look drastic and unnecessary but I wish to say something about it. Many developed countries like USA, Spain, Italy etc. have taken these measures after the virus spread. In Maharashtra as of today morning, according to news channels, although there were 49 infected people, 40 of them came from other countries and just 9 were the ones who were in contact with the affected. For a  heavily populated country like India, these numbers are almost unbelievable. If the government did not take such drastic measures, these numbers would not have been so small. I agree that these measures disturb our schedule and many think that this is just a step by Medical Industries to increase income but WHO wouldn't have taken the steps during already going on recession.

These numbers are better than many Developed countries. We have to appreciate Maharashtra Government for their hardwork and co-operate with them. If everyone cooperates with the Government then Government will surely loosen the restrictions and we will have less trouble. 

Don't overestimate your immune system and don't assume that you won't get infected. Just follow the instructions given out by the Health Minister. 

P.S.: These are just my own thoughts. You can choose to ignore them if you disagree",Dark_Ruler," Let me explain why \*I think\* these are incorrect numbers:

Because you are comparing with the countries in west, let me tell you that those numbers are based on extensive testing on people. So if people show symptoms like cough, fever, cold, they get tested for this virus along with others. Which is why there are many positive cases in west.

Now in India, ask how many of people who have the above symptoms have got tested for this virus. Or even went to the Doctor? The less you test, the less the numbers you will get. The countries in west are already in under almost total lockdown, yet the numbers are increasing (due to the high R0 of the virus). While in India, we still have many major companies & businesses operating in full-capacity mode, big crowded markets in Mumbai still open like almost every day.  There is no point in shutting down the schools & keeping kids at home if their parents are going to work everyday in Mumbai locals & coming back home. There is absolutely no reason yet to believe that the virus hasn't really spread or the number of real infected persons are that low.

As a human first & Indian second, I really do hope that we do somehow have low numbers & we are doing a real good job. This could be one example where India could standout strong among other major countries once this is all over. But right now, it is too early to say that we are in a better position than other countries. Hi I'd like to say that I work in Healthcare in one of the biggest companies in India and even though the govt is trying to do a good job which is commendable, they've been lying about the numbers. We've known and we reported it at least two weeks ago before that info went public and also, they've messed with the numbers. It's way drastic than it seems but ofc I understand the logic behind it. They're trying to make the public not panic. Understandable Readyplayerone80 Have u guys checked his profile",2020-03-19 19:36:51

If you have money, send everyone a memoribilia through courier. Fucking canc it already. Even only family would be a large gathering .. what with travel restrictions and all... Better to postpone Hey, so my wedding was in a week and we postponed it to whenever things have settled down a bit. Having been through the mess that is making this decision, these are my two cents: 1. Realise that older people and family will insist on attending this wedding because it’s family and shaadi and what not. If they do end up coming or you end up travelling, realise the risk you are putting yourselves and most importantly the older people in the family. Ask yourself if you want this wedding to be probably remembered as the one where a bunch of people caught the virus (hoping that doesn’t happen); 2. If the couple want a smaller wedding and that is a possibility, then do that. Just very close family or just a registered wedding with a reception later when this shit has calmed down; 3. While the family may have put in a lot of effort into planning this wedding and having a big bash, understand that these are extraordinary circumstances and everyone needs to step back and realise that things will not work as planned. We agreed to wait for a few months and if the situation doesn’t improve by then we will probably have a small ceremony and move on with our lives. It’s a very hard decision but for us the fact that we didn’t want to put anyone in danger especially the older guests and our parents took precedence. Good luck and stay safe! You have to cancel it mate. It's only going to get worse from here. Covid-19 isn't going anytime soon. India may well be at the start of the peak that is yet to come. Even conservative estimates put at least 30 crore getting infected in the next 2-3 months. Even with a 0.1% mortality rate(actual is 20x that), it is a grim grim 2020 summer we are looking at.

I think your guests and relatives will understand if you cancel the wedding. And even if you won't, the government sure as shit won't let a mass gathering happen at a time when fatalities would have surely increased.

(I have close relative whose wedding is getting cancelled too. And most people understand why.) Also for additional info, we are in mumbai and the bride is in Rajasthan, so even a family affair seems highly doubtful.

Thanks for your advices we'd better postpone it. you cancel it like everyone else and say sorry. My friend's wedding on April 9th was changed from Kerala back to Delhi, and now they have cancelled it, until further notice Bro same situation except my wedding same plan just closed wedding. But don't know if we will be able to travel between cities Save it for later, also the Indian economy is going to be hit the most. So unnecessary spending is not advised.",2020-03-23 17:06:37

I am pretty sure no prominent figure is gonna raise their voice against this.    
We are on our own.    
 Agle janam mohe minority hi kijo.   
 The worst thing about this reservation is that the government thinks job is just a one-way monthly income to the worker. The government never thinks of the quality of the work / importance of having merit do the job. This has the potential to irrepairably damage the standard of education / health and government services. Probably when an MP would have to get operated on by a non-meritous SC / ST surgeon they would know.

They should keep STEM merit based and away from reservation. How much empowerment does one need before feeling empowered? Apparently, not even after having a job.

I fail to see the rationale behind this. When in opposition, these sanghis would have called such a move ""appeasement"". I guess party with a difference is only different in terms of having a forked tongue.

I'm not even getting into merits of reservations in promotions- if designed properly, those would help counter the inherent bias within the system. However, knowing how spectacularly""the most capable administrator in india"" botched gst implementation, by passing a law without thinking (one country, one tax, only in name), and implementing it without being prepared, i can bet that there hasn't been any thought beyond, ""how can we split the dalit vote?"" Yeah fuck that.  Fine as long as its clerical work.  But I don't want my chief of surgery to be an average student. Where merit matters,  relaxation of criteria shouldn't be there. It's not going to be a big problem if you promote a 95% percent scoring SC/ST guy over a 97% general,  but not very good for general public when a general guy with all India rank 20,000 doesn't get admission to a govt medical college but a scst student who didn't even qualify for the admission has been admitted because there weren't any candidates from that caste who scored more than 50th percentile.

**SC, ST quota in promotion: Narendra Modi government takes this big decision** 

 ______ 
The move comes following a recent verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard.
(PTI)

The Centre today asked all its departments and the state governments to
implement reservation in promotion for employees belonging to Scheduled Caste
(SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories. The move comes following a recent
verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard. The Personnel Ministry, in an
order, said, “The cadre controlling authorities of Central government
ministries, departments and Union territories are to carry out promotions in
accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court.” Every promotion order
must clearly mention the stipulation that the promotion shall be subject to
further orders which may be passed by the Supreme Court, it said. According to
the order, besides the Central government departments concerned, state
governments are also advised to take necessary action in this matter.

The personnel ministry order will be applicable to SC and ST category
employees working with the Centre and the state governments, an officer said.
The apex court had on June 5 allowed the Centre to go ahead with reservation
in promotion for employees belonging to the SC and ST category in “accordance
with law”.

The top court took into account the Centre’s submissions that entire process
of promotion has come to a “standstill” due to the orders passed by various
high courts and the apex court had also ordered for “status quo” in a similar
matter in 2015. “We will say you (Centre) can go ahead with promotion in
accordance with law,” a vacation bench comprising Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel
and Ashok Bhushan had told Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Maninder Singh,
representing the Centre.

During the hearing, the ASG cited the case laws on the issue of quota in
promotion in government jobs and stated that the apex court’s 2006 judgement
in M Nagaraj case would be applicable. The M Nagaraj verdict had said that
creamy layer concept cannot be applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes for promotions in government jobs like two earlier verdicts of 1992
Indra Sawhney and others versus Union of India (popularly called Mandal
Commission verdict) and 2005 E V Chinnaiah versus State of Andhra Pradesh,
which dealt with creamy layer in Other Backward Classes category.

On November 15 last year, a three-judge bench of the apex court had agreed to
consider whether its 11-year-old judgement in M Nagaraj case was needed to be
re-visited. The nine-judge bench of Supreme Court had, in the Indira Sawhney
case in 1992, permitted reservation for the SCs and STs in promotion to
continue for a period of five years from November 16, 1992.

***The move comes following a recent verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard.*** 

But Modi ""did it"" ... /s

 ""Why are Indians settling in abroad?"" Sab Ka Sath. Sub ka Vikas The rationale behind this move seems to be to counter the domination of upper castes in certain posts like that of secretary in a ministry. There was a study done in 2013 which showed that out of 150 posts of secretary, there were 0 SC's and about 3 ST's. Its unimaginable that out of 150 posts the govt/establishment wasnt able to find even 1 SC IAS officer for a secretary level post. 

Even today you can take a look at the secretaries from the important ministries and you'll find a majority of them are from the upper castes.

Reservation in promotion makes the concept of reservation more meaningful. A lot of deputations are decided upon the discretion of the govt/minister. No marks for guessing which group gets the maximum bulk of those posts.

I don't understand what more of a disaster are people waiting for Delhi is heading towards ""Spirit of Delhi"" like situation where an annual phenomenon cripples the city, but no one does anything and everyone just sings kumbaya and hopes that it goes away naturally on its own next year. spd,emergency Really? I thought it decreases. Not bad not terrible People here were adamant that crackers were the main cause for Delhi's pollution or vehicle pollution is the main contributor.

Scheduled,Have there been any dalit main characters ('heroes' or 'heroines') in films that weren't about dalit issues?,61,e3uwu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e3uwu2/have_there_been_any_dalit_main_characters_heroes/,32,"I've been wondering this for a while. I'm not very good with divining caste from surnames, so I can't research this on my own without putting in a significant amount of extra effort.

Have we ever had any dalit main characters in mainstream films **that were not about casteism or discrimination**? I'm talking about 'heroes' and 'heroines,' characters who would be played by the superstars and a-listers of their respective eras in mainstream, big-budget Bollywood films.

This question is prompted by *Dhadak,* the remake of *Sairat* in which they changed the caste of one of the main characters.",pagesindigo," Chachi 420.

Hero's surname was Paswan. Lagaan had a guy who could spin the ball but belonged to scheduled caste iirc. It's not played by some major actor tho. Newton Commenting again because I wanted to read the other replies. Ive seen newton and I missed any caste assertion in that.

Mukkebaaz has a character that is a wrestling coach of lower caste. The movie doesnt make a big deal of it while still pointing out caste prejudices. Rajkummar Rao's character in Newton is implied to be Dalit. Sushir Mishra is making a series on Manu Joseph's ""**Serious Men**"" in which Nawazuddin will play a dalit character.

Vicky Kaushal in **Masaan** 

These are some old movies:

 **Ankur (1974):** The Shyam Benegal directed film sees Shabana Azmi play a lower caste woman whom an upper caste landlord falls for. The film won National Awards for Azmi, lead actor Sadhu Meher and for second best feature film.

**Sujata (1959):** The Bimal Roy film is a romance between an upper caste man and an untouchable woman. The Sunil Dutt and Nutan-starrer was awarded the All India Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film at the National Awards that year.

 **Satgati (1981):** The Satyajit Ray directed tele-film tells the story of a poor Dalit, played by Om Puri, who turns around the injustices against lower castes in his village. It was based on a short story of the same name by Munshi Premchand. What about Aamir Khan's character in 3 idiots? Not sure if Dalit specifically, but he certainly wasn't upper caste Most Tamil movies featirecnon-Savarns characters and actors in lead roles. I'm not sure I'd be able to identify a character's caste,if it isn't specifically mentioned. Our naming conventions make that task difficult.

Masan

Saif Ali Khan in Arakshan (I think the first time a superstar in Bollywood played a Dalit character, but it shows casteism)

Achut Kanya and Sujata had dalit female protagonists

Malayalam actor Kalabhavan Mani has portrayed lot of characters who has a Dalit background. In one he acts as an auto driver who becomes IAS. 

The lead protagonists of Malayalam movie Kammattippadam are from Dalit background. It is also about gangwar and not explicit about casteism. That is a brilliant question. All the movies where the hero is lower caste that are stated in this thread (Aarakshan, Shyam Benegal films etc.) are explicitly about caste or the character's (Kachra in Lagaan) caste is a part of the story. But, why do characters in your typical romantic comedies and masala entertainers only called Kapoor or Malhotra or Oberoi or Sharma?

One character I can remember from a recent web-series (Kota Factory) is called Meena which is SC. However, the caste is completely irrelevant to the story - which is pretty heartening. commenting so I can check later. How do you identify the cast of the character in a movie? I know I could get downvoted for this, but frankly I don't care. I have zero knowledge on how to ""divine caste from someone's last name"" as I was taught to respect all humans equally, so I don't think about the last names of characters in bollywood movies (if I watch them instead of watching Hollywood) Why does it even matter?
I am sure caste is not something casting directors look for.",2019-11-30 19:22:59
Scheduled,Trip Advise: Uttarakhand/Himachal - June or later - 2 people - 3/4 days,0,ftifyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftifyl/trip_advise_uttarakhandhimachal_june_or_later_2/,20,"Hi,

I'm planning a honeymoon trip to either Uttarakhand or Himachal for me and my fiance (Provided Corona settles down). These two are the places that we're interested in right now, but suggestions are welcome for any other hillstation/scenic places too. Budget is around 50k flexible for 3/4 days and 3/4 nights.

Even though Shimla/Manali were common choices, it looks airports are far from these places and I don't wanna sit in bus/car for 9hrs+ straight. I'm looking for places which have airports much closer and Dehradun came up. I was thinking of may be covering Dehradun, Nainital etc. in June.

1. Are Dehradun and Nainital good for a peaceful honeymoon trip? I'm not looking to cover a lot of places with a tight schedule. I'd rather visit a few calm and quiet scenic places and spend a bit of time there.
2. Is the weather nice there in June or will it be too hot? Also in case Corona situation continues how's the weather during July/August? I don't wanna extend it too much to really cold weather either.
3. I'm planning to book hotels on my own and hire a cab with driver for the duration. Any suggestion on this? Looking for reliability more than anything, since this will be our first trip I don't want any hassles as you can imagine. Or any reliable packages that I should look into?
4. Any other scenic places near to these locations that I must visit? Like I mentioned before I don't wanna spend a lot of time in car especially if the terrain is rough.

Thanks you for reading and sorry for the long post.",automatedbanana," June/July in hill stations means over crowded shit 1. Yes, both of them peaceful places... The landscapes, rivers, mountains are something you should look forward in the Uttarakhand 

2. Dehradun use to have really pleasent weather (30-32° in peak summers) but hopefully Rains don't become a spoil sport :)

3. Hotels and all won't be really expensive (i guess) 

4. 3-4 days will be enough to explore both of these places according to me (Dehradun and Nanital) ... 

P.S. Make sure to book hotels beforehand June/July the monsoons are in a full swing here in Himachal ( Dharamshala especially) so do take that aspect into consideration as well . May, June 2020 ? Forget it. Better to postpone the wedding right away, Go NE. Tourists rarely go there, weather is nice if you like rains, peaceful and scenic environment.

Important controversial Judgement: Justice Goel’s judgment on prevention of misuse of SC/ST Act in Dr. Shubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. The State of Maharashtra, is one of the much talked about decision. Justice Goel along with Justice Lalit examined the question on the inclusion of procedural safeguards so that the provisions of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (SC/ST) Act 1989 are not abused for extraneous considerations. The Bench held that, a Government official cannot be prosecuted on mere allegation of committing an offence under the Act without the sanction of appointing authority. [1](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/justice-ak-goel-retires-from-sc-defends-his-judgment-in-sc-st-act-51270) [2](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-ak-goel-who-ruled-on-dalit-atrocities-law-retires-from-top-court-1879280)

***So what about him?***

Let's go back to Vajpayee's government when Arun Jaitley was Minister of Law and Justice.

From Article: [Govt ignored IB report on HC judge](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Govt-ignored-IB-report-on-HC-judge/articleshow/45701970.cms).

>*High court judges are appointed in the following way: The state government sends a list of names through the governor to the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the concerned high court. This list is then sent to the law ministry, which obtains an IB report on the nominees. Thereafter, it prepares a matrix with three criteria â€” professional competence, integrity and political links.*  
>  
>*In the case of Goel, the law ministry matrix contains no entry under the ''Professional Competence'' column, while the ''Reputation/Integrity'' column bluntly says: ""Corrupt person"".*  
>  
>*The key to his subsequent appointment appears to be the listing in the political affiliation column, which notes that Goel was general secretary of the All-India Adhiwakta Parishad, the lawyers'' wing of the RSS. Curiously, among the five short-listed advocates whose integrity the IB had questioned, he was the only one cleared by the ministry.*  
>  
>*Having sent back the file once, Narayanan had the constitutional obligation of approving the appointment but he made his unhappiness clear. The President noted: ""Nonetheless, I feel that a more desirable course of action would have been to follow the same procedure as was done in a similarly placed case of the Calcutta High Court where the advice of the Chief Justice, which is integral to the selection process, was sought again and duly received...I would also appreciate if my instant observations are shared with the Chief Justice of India along with my earlier observation dated May 3, 2001 on this matter.""*

***He then became the Chief Justice of the Odisha High Court and the Gauhati High Court before becoming the Supreme Court Judge.***

### Goel was elevated to the Supreme Court alongside Arun Mishra.

The Caravan Magazine says and I quote

>*the collegium had thrice considered and decided against Mishra’s nomination; on one of these occasions, it had asked for a background check on him. According to an article in the Economic and Political Weekly, the check revealed that Mishra was close to the RSS. Any prior reservations were evidently put aside with the advent of the Modi government.*

\[But I couldn't search in *Economic and Political Weekly, If anyone finds the article, please do comment \].*

AK Mishra has been known for his BJP favouring judgements. [1](https://theprint.in/report/friend-of-cji-misra-target-supreme-court-judges-ire/28323/) [2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/contempt-threat-to-lawyer-justice-arun-mishra-apologises/articleshow/72380063.cms) [3](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/article29897723.ece)

Well, none of these are wrong to someone who considers RSS-BJP as a group run by pristine men.

This series is not for them, but for those who have recognised the RSS-BJP as fas\_ist forces but fail to understand what went soo wrong with our great judicial system.

PS: This series is heavily influenced by Caravan Magazine report [In Sua Causa. What the judiciary has done to itself-ATUL DEV](https://caravanmagazine.in/law/what-judiciary-done-itself)

###",The_andh_bhakth," great post. Sorry for the repost. Tell me what is wrong with the first judge. From what you have written it seems a fairly balanced judgment. This is an awesome information Even the defence has been infiltrated by RSS I wish this post is pinned or at least gets visibility.

This deserves to be read by maximum people.Lots of important judgements already passed favoring the govt.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.
   * A 2001 verdict of the South African court cited the Indian case of Narain Das Jain v Agra Nagar Mahapalika decided by the Supreme Court in 1991 to benchmark the compensation to be provided while acquiring land.
* Use of ICT: The need for technology was highlighted to deliver speedy justice.
* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 4) Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

I didn't learnt anything . I was having headache over the day. People Who Had Attended The coaching for long hours, How you survived? Did you learn anything?... Knowledge Is being drained into brain constantly for 7 hours !",purifiedhuman," [deleted] >How you survived?

Take proper rest. Sleep on time and eat well. It'll help tremendously. Your coaching time is when you should be the most attentive, if you're having headaches, you won't be able to focus properly.

>Did you learn anything?

If I was interested in the topic and my head felt in place, the classes were indeed fun and I learnt a lot. Some of the coaching teachers are very good. If it was a difficult or boring topic, my mind usually drifted away, and not paying attention in class only caused problems in future. Reading a little about the topic that's going to be taught beforehand helps.

If you actually understand what's being taught, it'll become MUCH easier to sit through those 7 hours, trust me. If you didn't get anything in the class today, read your notes, read the textbook, watch YouTube videos on the topic. Watch the video over and over till you finally understand what your coaching teacher was trying to say. There are many good YouTube channels for JEE syllabus, they helped me more than any notes or textbook. 

If you go to the next class without knowing what was taught in this class, it'll only get worse from there.

And bro, I've been in your place. It's very difficult, but you can't do anything about it expect make sure the hardwork you do gives you the result you want. Please make a proper schedule and stick to it. Always analyze how you do the in the exams, and take them seriously. Most importantly, please don't procrastinate. All the best! Education is important but it is so so overrated in our country. 

Plus most Indian students have no practical knowledge at all of what they learn.

I would like to tell you that don't force yourself if you don't like something just because everyone else is doing it.. Like if you don't like coaching classes and spending time there is like a punishment then you should probably self study (there is enough material available these days). If you have enough interest in what you are learning then self studying is really fun and plus you get to know if you are actually interested!

Rather, I am an American-born Pakistani. I have subscribed to this subreddit because I think it's important to understand the other half of the discussion. 

I don't want my idea of what Indians believe to be made up entirely of my family's steriotypes of what this community is. 

In addition to being of Pakistani descent and from a muslim family, I am also gay. I was shocked when India legalized gay marriage. I always thought Pakistani and Indian culture to be so similar. This was what piqued my interest in India. I wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mentality and political compass of Indians as far as I could understand it through Reddit (which I understand is not necessarily demonstrative of the majority of Indian voters).

Countless times I have been inspired by the Indian Reddit community's relentless efforts to cling to the secular identity of Indian political culture. Time and time again, I read about Indian pride for being the largest democracy. This is in most cases, within the context of a diverse community. People of every faith and every ethnicity all as Indian citizens sharing a common but spectacularly diverse culture.  

I am so glad that I chose to follow this subreddit or I probably wouldn't know that there is in fact a very large population of Indians who object to islamophobia or racist views of the vast subcultures of India. 

So I just wanted to thank everyone who stands for the Indian cultural ideal of tolerance and inclusiveness. It's very inspiring and I hope that bigots around the globe can learn a thing or two from this.

Edit: It has been pointed out that in fact gay marriage has not been legalized, rather, sodomy has been decriminalized. I stand corrected and apologize for this misconception. I do still however maintain that it is an excellent step in the right direction as another commenter has mentioned.",lolwtftheyrealltaken," Thank you mate <3. One day, I will go visit Pakistan and experience the culture there. Thanks for the note.

Not to take away from your points, or discredit this sub, but unfortunately I doubt this subreddit reflects the majority sentiment among India's youth. 

Uneducated bigotry and hatred among communities runs deep in this country. At a very basic level, it can dictate who gets jobs and who can and cannot rent an apartment in a locality.

This sub inspires me too, but any illusions about right wing fanaticism coming to an end in India are just that, pure delusion. This will be a long fight, and one which we must recognise is worth fighting even if we don't win in the end. Caste hindus repressing muslims these days, its a sinister ploy, so nobody turns their head  towards the upper caste hindu treatment of the low caste hindus, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. >  India legalized gay marriage. 

This has not happened. Homosexuality has been decriminalized though. You don't go to jail for gay sex anymore. Gay marriage will take more time to materialise.

Reddit India by itself is more like a minuscule influencer. Has some effect on the overall situation, but nothing compared to popular social media.

But the youth have surprised many. My own generation has become entirely biased, and often hate-filled, eager to feel good listening to bombast and applauding cruelty. The kids - some of them - are doing a much better job than us. Dude get your facts straight, India DID NOT legalize gay marriage it just decriminalized sodomy. Way away from legalization.",2019-12-21 03:02:32

Try to isolate yourself and wait it out. Take preventive measures. Parents need to understand that while the ""home' may be the safest place there is, the way to home is a shot on the foot. I can understand your feeling, since I am here in Germany. To make our families understand back home is very difficult but staying back here and keeping ourself safe would be the best measures right now. Situation is changing every day. If you leave now, there's a non-zero chance that you will get stuck in some airport en route, or sent to an army quarantine for several days. Better to stay put, take precautions, and keep calling people at home multiple times a day to check on them and assure them that you're ok. Travel is the risky part.

Especially that thakur guy and that brahmin pandit. No amount of education is gonna change people like them and it's just sad to say that majority of the population in India is like them. > Brahman mandir me ganta bhajate hai aur hum logoko bewakoof banate hai

🙏

It's sad to see literates condoning casteism. How fucked up is our education system. Asking upper castes if discrimination exists is like asking white people if racism exists. Shocking as this may seem, most white people will say that ""racism used to exist 100 years ago maybe, but not anymore"".

Here's a simple idea. 90% of humans are right handed, 10% are left handed. If you look at all the students who have gotten into college and found that the split between right and left handers isn't 90-10, that's an indication that something strange is going on. If you see 95-5 or 99-1, that's not necessarily an indication that left handers are being discriminated against actively or that right handers are genetically superior, but certainly something to investigate further.

If you saw the 99-1 split in a saw mill, you might come to the conclusion that right handers are simply better, more hardworking, more deserving. After all, the interview process didn't ask them which their dominant hand was, and poor performers are fired. If you investigate, you'll realise that all your tools are designed for right handers (ask any left hander you know about scissors) and this inherent disadvantage means that they can't work effectively. But if you never investigate, you'll never find out. And even after, if you don't have the will to fix it, nothing will improve.

We need two things to solve a problem - figuring out the solution, then implementing the solution. If solving the problem would harm us, why would we bother? Why would a bunch of right handers fix the tools at the saw mill when it would increase competition for jobs?

---

And that is what reservation does. Upper castes (approx 30% of the population) would take 70-80% of the seats in higher education if there was no reservation. You might see that and think ""fair enough, if that's how the exam results look, that's the way it should be"". But we could potentially fix this by investing a *lot* more in public education, in rural education. If we paid teachers 3x more, spent 10x on teacher training, 5x more on school facilities, we would bridge the gap in 20 or 30 years. But we won't. Because the people with power and influence in society all send their kids to private schools anyway. We are not personally affected by the problem of a lack of opportunities, so we have no *incentive* to fix it, just like the right handers won't fix the tools.

If we actually fixed it and India became egalitarian, our 30% of society would only get around 30% of the seats. That's a *worse* situation than we are in currently (where we have 50%). Why would we spend thousands of crores to actually reduce the opportunities available for our kids? We won't. That's why reservation exists - to give an opportunity for the folks who went to shitty schools with shitty teachers a shot at a better life. 

---

And now you might reasonably ask - ""but look, what difference does it make? All the benefits go to a tiny minority of people from that caste."" And you are right. But you're forgetting two things. Firstly in India, people take care of their extended family. The first person from a clan to go to college and get a good job mentors their siblings and cousins, pays for their education, brings them up. 

And secondly, although most people from lower castes won't actually benefit from reservation, it's still a source of hope for them. They are poor, they have no prospects. Not only that, poor public education means their kids don't have prospects either. But they don't know it. They delude themselves into thinking their kids could potentially go to college under reservation. ""But this is horrible! These poor people are being duped!"" you might think. But it works out well for the rest of us, because the day the downtrodden majority wakes up and realises that they and their kids have no hope, they will burn society to the ground. The same will happen if reservation is stopped - because that is their only hope of a better life.

No more reservation sounds good. But all the colleges have been burned down. You'll have 100% of the seats - which are now 0. Enjoy. IMHO, I grew up in city(Hyderabad) all my life and I have personally not seen untouchability to the extent where it needs so much reservation, but then I started engineering in 2003 and there was a guy Hari who was is a ST not a bright lad, didn't speak English low on self confidence and would sit by himself. One day we were playing carroms and we only had 3 guys so I invited him to play and he refused and I literally had to drag him to play and saw him smile the first time, we played end of story. From then on he would just smile at me and a year went by in second year I spoke to him just casually why he doesnt talk to anyone but these days he started coming to play carroms and TT and he didnt answer and then I pestered him over weeks and he said ""I did not know everyones caste and did not want to pick any fights"".  

I said what, why do you want to know caste and he said I am a ST and people dont like us touching and he sat next to a couple guys on a bench and got to know all 3 were SC/St's and over next days he told me stories about how he was made felt in his village. I guess people in cities live in a bubble or are not exposed to a lot of atrocities or oppression people in villages face. It was still a crazy realization I had until then, but is reservation the answer - ""I dont know"". If I show this video to one of my upper caste friends (his caste was once on the verge of being declared as an OBC, but after the people of his caste expressed outrage due to provocation by upper castes, it never got declared as OBC), he will say that the video is scripted and will say that all of this is made up shit and that untouchability and caste discrimination are very rare today. [removed] Most people do not base their worldview on statistic tables, but on their personal experiences or taught worldview. Untouchability, heavy caste based segregation and oppression based on caste based delineation, especially towards Dalits, exists. We have decades over decades of statistical evidence to prove that. But to people who haven't grown up in that kind of environment, it is hard to rationalize this with what their acquired worldview is and the first reaction is to vehemently deny it altogether. This isn't just caste, but climate change, racism, debates about specific economic policies, kashmir and so on.


However, these kind of anecdotal interviews are about as valid as a privileged tier 1 urbanite going I've never seen casteism, these are fringe cases, etc. Showing it as a perspective is fine, trying to use it as concrete evidence of systemic caste based oppression around the country is less tenable. I am an SC and a benefctor of our great eservation system .

Reservation has only helped me in getting into admission into a tier 1 college, my basics was very weak as I came from a vernacular medium government operated school.  
Even though I got admission, I was still a outcaste  as I didn't have that rich vibes which other general category student has, only solace was that I was good in sports which made me popular in campus. 

Let me get it straight , My view is reservation should be there but there has to be a cap and additional regulation.
Reservation should only be there in primary and secondary level of education in premier private  schools ,not the government colleges . 

Now ,as per present condition my son can avail reservation but I don't think it is required as my wife is a Brahmin and I am living in a tier 1 city where atleast my son hasn't faced any such caste discrimination.

My building watchmen is a Brahmin who salutes me daily to get some tip, if there is a procedure where I can forego my son sc status to his son, then I will happily do it. If caste has to be the unspoken thing, first and foremost thing to do is to stop talking about caste! Self is where the start comes from. we can't change elders. but we can change this generation and ourselves. give this guy a good mic for god's sake Genuinely asking. What is wrong with a reservation system based on economics instead of caste ? 

Since most lower caste individuals are anyway disadvantaged economically they will be accommodated. At the same time rich people who happen to be of lower caste will not be eligible thus allowing some other more deserving lower caste/ economically disadvantaged person to take their place. Didn't watch the video but the answer is simple - upper caste have not faced caste discrimination against them like how the Dalits do and hence they feel it doesn't exist. Often the guys in question actually treat all people well and hence feel this is a myth.

Even if a large majority of upper castes don't perpetuate caste discrimination, there is sizeable population who do it and also tacit approval from equally large number of people. 

Also in my experience in the South atleast, upper castes may sometimes be arrogant but quite open minded. Most of the caste discrimination is done by OBCs. End caste system, End reservation. Its that fuckin simple. [removed] Even though i don't doubt caste discrimination is there, but you'll also have to look at the other side of the picture. In urban areas castes are becoming irrelevant. 

One of my school friends just 6 months ago told me that he got a seat in Punjab University because he was an SC. His father and mother are on also on a government job, money has never been an issue for him. Here is my take, he didn't need reservation for University because he is from a well of family. I have been friends with him for 10 years now i didn't even knew that he was an SC, i suspect he didn't tell because he was afraid of how we'll see him if he came out. Therefore i my view, even though there are economic components to this problem but to solve it it will take a social movement. Where people can be proud of there ancestors even though they came from lower castes. [removed] I don't think they will like reservations based on economic conditions either, Muslims are one of the  most economically disadvantaged communities in India [removed]",2019-09-20 13:45:13

Had extremely extremely high social anxiety, 0 confidence, followed by crippling depression. Ideas like I will never be able to earn money etc. Now: social anxiety is so less, its completely crazy.  Almost gone is several cases.

Realize depression, anxiety WILL go away. You are wrong if you think your anxiety can't go away or you won't be confident. Same with depression, curable. Get this in your head.

Things that actually really worked with me:

1. Sunlight! My psychiatrist told me. 1 hr daily. Direct sunlight on your head, neck areas, ideally within 3 hrs on waking. He also suggested about an option of buying some lights that do the same thing.
2. Sleep schedule is very important !! Cannot be stressed enough. Something I ignored for years! Even now its not perfect. But wake early after 7-8 hrs of sleep. Wake at 6AM, go outside in the morning breeze.
3. Exercise. Strength exercise specifically. At least for me. Its not about muscles. Your body, you, feel different. I didn't know back muscles could be flexed. Don't attempt to rush it though. Make it a medium term plan to become physically stronger. Start slow, stretch, jog, walk. Avoid injuries. took 4-5 months to feel results. 

Confidence is not magic. Nor is depression a mystery. Think scientifically. Human body has evolved for millions of years in a certain environment - with open areas, lot of sunlight, doing hard labour. In the absence of sunlight, living in a cave with a weak body, our body is in unknown waters. Issues are bound to happen imo.",gyaani_guy," Beta tum subah uthke toh dekho Woke up for a whole year at 6 am and cycled or ran for about an hour every morning. Went to sleep at sharp 10:30 pm everyday. Ate healthy. Developed depression and anxiety. Seriously was happy as fuck when I used to grind counter strike 12 hrs a day with college, eating shit food and too much daily. Confidence was through the roof, was extroverted as fuck. Made friends within minutes. 

Nothing works for everyone. You must identify the cause for your depression and do whatever to distract from it. No therapist/psychiatrist can help you like you can. See your financial situation and see what you can afford to do that you like doing. 

Also, single biggest cause for depression be these hoes man. They don't wanna see you happy. They trap a happy man and break him down to pieces. Chase a check homies, never chase a bitch. So I see someone read ""Upward Spiral"" Also, meditation has helped me a lot with my anxiety and depression. Even meditating for 10mins daily has reduced my negative/self harm thoughts quite a bit (although it takes patience and consistency) Yup. Follow evolution. What has worked for 1000+ years will work for your life. Keeping your mind busy does wonders I would say",2020-02-24 02:15:33

Scheduled,(CONFESSION) Kinda Stuck Here,34,f9a1i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9a1i5/confession_kinda_stuck_here/,17,"Alright people, my post might be a bit self-centered with all the chaos and bloodshed that is happening right now in our capital city. But, I really want to share this out here so as to get some good advice, feedback and discussions.

A few months back, I got a job in very nascent startup and been working there as a Graphic Designer. Tbh, I like everything about the role and the job that I get to do here, people appreciate, validate and respect the work that I am doing here - I have no complaints in that regard.

Sure, being a very new startup, there aren't much co-workers around and the very handful there are, are older to me by a generation or so and thus, we have almost little to none in common with each other. I am also the only designer in my department and thus, things tend to get very lonely for me, at times (though, I've been plagued with loneliness for years now). 

But these aren't a dealbreaker for me and aren't the reasons for why I have made this post in the first place.

The dealbreaker for me however, lies in the fact that I am expected to show up to work for all 7 days. 7\*365. Let alone this, I used to be the kind of person who loathed the idea of there being a 6-day working schedule (as one barely gets to do anything in that single day they get on a Sunday).

I mean, this was made clear to me during interview, when I enquired them about the weekends. And I understand, being a part of the food and beverage industry, the company is expected to operate 24\*7\*365, due to the kind of industry that it is part of.

I thought, after not being in a job for the previous year, my self-discipline and schedule went out of control and thought maybe working all 7 days will get back my old discipline as I thought that it will make me ""more active"" and ""less lazy"". 

And, I guess, I've been proved wrong all the while, simultaneously, my doubts have been proved true too, in regards to working all 7 days.

I struggle to get up early now, even despite getting sound sleep and going to bed early (I made a thread about this, a few days back here). I really feel burned out and am struggling to get my tasks done, due to not being able to focus and concentrate properly. I mean, I felt the burn-out in a mere months after I started working.

Again, I understand the kind of industry I am in, what I don't understand however, is why must I, a designer (well, I am a Marketing Analyst to be more precise, if that helps), needs to show up for all 7 days? I understand the production team needing to show up like that as well, F&B industry but even me too? Besides, the production team, most of them, reside nearby in a lodging whereas, it takes me 40-50 minutes to reach my office and home.

I took a day-off today and whatsapped my boss even, telling him that I need this break as I have been struggling to do my tasks for the past few days for which, he understood and granted.

And thus, I am feeling that this job is too much for me, the schedule at least. Which is sad, as I like almost every aspect of this job, being the only designer in my company, I also don't have any managers supervising or micromanaging ( I report to the CEO directly) and thus, I am bestowed with full control in what I get to do.

The timing is also not fixed. Boss seems like the kind of person who knows what he is actually doing and isn't egoistic, petty or tyrannical in any way.

I honestly don't think that I can get such freedom and privilege anywhere else . And that is why it pains me to share this post as despite all this perks, no matter how good and ""ideal"" a work is for someone, ultimately, there needs to be a break where I could have all the personal time that I crave for and where once, just for once, I don't need to wake up everyday with the thought that I need to go to work for that day. 

Sure, during Sunday I could leave for work earlier than usual but, it defeats the point of keeping it in the first place, doesn't it? To only show up for a handful of hours, there is ample time to get whatever work there is left, in the remaining 6 full days.

My fear is also that, if i resign from this job, I don't think that I would get one anywhere else. Seeking for one for three full months prior to landing in this and eclipsing this from my parents (mother especially, as I feel that they tend to give a typical, Boomer-esque advice that doesn't help me at all and only infuriates me further) was already a cruel and painful experience, man. 

I would quit this in a heartbeat if my mother is an understanding and supportive type. Expect, she is very emotionally abusive and neglectful and will never (and has never in the past too) ever, provide me the support that I want (and even deserve maybe). She will at best, be neutral and at worst, be antagonistic towards me (and she's like that too to both my Dad and sibling).

Based on the feedback I get (and deep down personally), I know that I am not a bad designer, if I try and put effort. And yet, I was sucking in all the interviews that I attended prior. Was it because I am a fresher? I don't want to go to the whole ordeal again.

And thus, I feel like I am stuck here. I am sorry for the long post, but wanted to let this out in the hopes that others can hear and understand the predicament I am in, right now.

TL:DR - Graphic Designer (Marketing Analyst, actually) working for almost 3 months now. Satisfied with everything else, though need to show all 7 days in a week due to the industry and thus, is gradually taking a toll on me. Afraid of quitting and finding a new one in the fears that I won't get any, because of being a Fresher no matter how competent I might be. And also in the fears that I won't get the perks and privileges (that I've described in this post) that I am enjoying here.",TheFatherofOwls," Get another job and put your papers. Perks and privilege cannot compensate work-life balance. Hey, sorry to hear that you are in such situation. I can understand your dilemma. My only advice is that before you take any major steps like quitting, may be just give it a try to talk to your boss. 

From what you wrote it looks like he is a reasonable guy so may be  ask him for an unofficial coffee meeting and just calmly explains everything that you wrote here. But in a more businessy way (with concrete points, facts and numbers). For example: think from his perspective, he is the CEO of a start-up so the company's success hangs on his shoulder. You need to show him that you can do equally good or even better job in the 6 day week and contribute effectively in the company's growth. 

If its ok, you can also offer him a little reduction in your pay against one day off. Otherwise if he still disagrees try asking for alternatives, like home office or any other weekday off (where one of your colleagues can support if urgent).

No industry no matter which branch does not need to work round the clock. Even employees of emergency services like 911 work in shifts. So the expectation from company is unrealistic and by not hiring an additional resource they are just trying to save money. 

Nonetheless, if they really appreciate you and value your work they should agree to make little adjustments to keep you happy and productive. And if nothing else work then go ahead and quit. Your mental and physical health is much important and you will get another job sooner or later. All the best! Was in a similar position to yours last year , Didn't work 7 days like you but the work was intense like Going to office at 10AM and getting home at 11PM . Luckily I was an intern there So I was pretty sure I wouldn't want to join that company . I performed terribly in the last month and wasn't offered a job after the internship . Sure it took me like 2.5 month to find a new job and but it's worth it . 

Leave the current job . It isn't that bad as you think it is. Sure it will take you time to find a new job but this 7Days work is going to suck life out of you with little to no reward regarding the amount of effort you put in . People here have a bias for working in a startup but they often neglect this side of it . Your CEO is going to jail if the labor department gets a whiff of this nonsense.",2020-02-25 21:11:08
Scheduled,Indigo flight to chandigarh overbooked passengers stranded.,271,ea0iu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ea0iu4/indigo_flight_to_chandigarh_overbooked_passengers/,39,"So, flight 6E 592 from Bangalore to Chandigarh Indigo airlines has been overbooked by indigo. These guys came to know about this when boarding bus was at the door of aircraft with 50-70 passengers still in boarding bus. 

We have kept the flight stranded for now.

But such irresponsible behaviour from indigo has left all of us in jiffy. We are standing at tarmac currently.

Will update.

Please upvote this for visibility. These are such malicious practices. How can they have overbooked so much.

Update1: so indigo guys scheduled same flight to two different places instead of two. And passengers for other location (I couldn't get that) have not be allowed to board.
Now they have boarded all the Chandigarh passengers.
But rest are still stranded. I am on board but still there are atleast 30 people stranded. This is some pathetic show by indigo

Also I am not sure whether i will get my luggage today.

Okay will update after I reach Chandigarh airplane mode time. Hope these guys don't remain stranded here for long.

Real shit show by indigo

Update 2: Reached Chandigarh got my luggage.

About the whole fiasco. Seems like those passengers were going to Amritsar and Indigo cancelled their flights and tried to put them on Chandigarh flight and a further passage to Amritsar. Now due to almost complete show by Chandigarh passengers ,Amritsar guys were stopped from boarding.
TLDR: seems like indigo miscalculated the no show and caused stranded passengers
 Edit: https://www.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/6E/592

Since some are doubting this story. Above is flight stats link for the flight. 40min delay was due to this whole drama. Now I am hoping someone comes up with video or news of this. Should have taken the pics",kindasapien," This is the United Airlines version of India How did they even assign the same seat on boarding passes to two different people? This does not make sense. [deleted] [deleted] 50-70 people? Baapre

Overbooking ki bhi seema hoti hai.. Put on twitter. while it's a shitshow, Airlines routinely overbook using certain algorithms to ensure that flight stays full because there are almost always no-shows. The US/EU Air travel regulators have rules regarding this, and so does the DGCA. This is officially known as ""Denied Boarding"".

DCGA Rules: [http://www.dgca.nic.in/kyrdgca/KYR\_portal.html](http://www.dgca.nic.in/kyrdgca/KYR_portal.html) 

File a Grievance to get your flight costs back via the Ministry of Civil Aviation Portal: [airseva.gov.in](https://airseva.gov.in) This happened once with me in SpiceJet. They had some technical fault in their first aircraft. There was a delay of two hours, no announcement no SMS nothing. I was sick that day so I didn't have the energy to run after the ground staff.

When boarding started I was given seat no. 37B, when I boarded the aircraft just had seats till 32. I asked the steward and he said that there was a technical fault in the first aircraft and there are less no. Of seats in this aircraft.

I quickly sat on the first available seat that I saw. It was the front most row. I thought if someone argued with me I will reply them my puke. Thankfully, no one asked to move and no, I didn't puke. Pic or it didn't happen. 4 or 5 passengers overbooking per sector is done at the most. That's the worst case.
Usually its 1 or 2.

Scheduled,(CONFESSION) In a Dilemma,8,fe9bye,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fe9bye/confession_in_a_dilemma/,11,"Alright, this is a follow-up to a post I made a week back regarding me feeling stuck in a job that I really like but also, one that expects me to show up for work all 7 days.

I seem to have trouble giving a link to my first post here as upon posting, I get a message saying that it is awaiting approval. Been trying to do it for a couple of hours and I felt by then, the post would have gotten stale and old to be seen by others, in the feed.

A few days back, while leaving for the day after de-briefing with my boss, he noticed me looking tired than usual (really was dull and tired that day) and told me if there's anything wrong with me. I told him there's nothing wrong but he insisted. Since it's been only 3 months since I joined work, my probation period was coming to an end. I told him that whatever issue that I have, I'll discuss with him during my performance review that would have likely been conducted after the probation got over.

But, he insisted sharing whatever was bothering me and thus, I spilled it out - that a 7 day working schedule is too much for me to handle and that I might not be a fit in this industry (note that I've mentioned ""industry"" and not the ""company"") in the long run (It's a food and beverage industry). I told him a day off in a week is all I expect. For which, he told me that he is fine with me taking a break every week as long as I don't take it on a Sunday, as the production team too, will start demanding days-off.

I guess, it is kinda reasonable but still, I find it odd that there's no day-off by default and that I have to take one from my part. But that's kinda resolved, right? Except this isn't the problem.....

When he inquired me as to what my long-term goals are, I told him (and have told him prior, even on my interview) that my endgame is to become a professor in the field of Humanities or a psychologist. He kinda dismissed that desire of mine and told me flat-out that I am not a ""professor material"" as I am shy, reserved and socially awkward who lacks people skills. He told me that the role that I am in, right now, is what I was made to do due to how good and ""exemplary"" I have been, in these three months it seems.

He broke down in detail and gave (what I feel) was a worst-case estimate as to how my desire won't work out for me and told me that he too was in my place when he was my age - confused and ""lacking a sense of direction"" and told me as to how he earned this place due to sheer hard work and asked me data to back-up my claim of becoming a teacher, when I told him my desire was purely based on intuition (he told me to not ""hide behind such a pretext"").

Honestly, I felt humiliated, insulted and destroyed after the conversation. This is the first time someone is telling me that I am not a professor material. As, based on previous interactions with some of my classmates, friends and even my teachers, almost everyone agreed that I have what it took to become one. But, boss was a highly educated guy who has had tons of XP with life and is sitting in this position out of his sheer hard work and dedication and so, he implied that by not taking his advice, I am losing a great opportunity and going on a path in ruining my life.

I felt so patronized and the entire conversation reeked of condescension, from his part. I literally could not tell anything from my defense and told him that I'll prove him wrong somehow.

Tbh, I never even told that I was planning on quitting....all I said was that the schedule was too much for me and so, I'll give a few more months only after which, I might call ""quits"". He told me to quit asap if that was the case, as he does not wish to invest and spend any further on me as it was go to waste, once I quit and thus, he'll have to find another one and have to start the entire thing from scratch all over again. Which is very understandable and fair, as I never thought about it from that perspective.

Honestly though, I did not know quitting a job will be this emotionally draining and intensive. I thought it would be cold, formal process but no....they patronized, guilt-tripped me and made me feel absolutely terrible and worthless.

He has given me two days time to come to a conclusion and based on what I wrote in my previous post, I am still stumped and at a loss in taking a decision based on the perks and privileges I enjoy here. But the whole interaction has left me with a bad taste in my mouth - no one patronizes me and dictates me into telling what I should be and what I cannot be and insult, mock and belittle my desires and dreams under the pretext of being ""honest, rational and practical"".

Maybe my desires are impractical but, it could have been broken down to me in a better way.

(Sorry for the long post and please read my previous post that I have linked in the first paragraph, to get a better context).",TheFatherofOwls," Listen Buddy. Follow your instincts don't listen to other's opinions no matter how much XP they have.. cause end of the day either you will embrace your decisions or regret it but it will be all yours. Not some one else's. And if though you succeed there will be always a dilemma in you what if I followed my passion my instincts I would have been more successful. New lesson to learn. 

You boss is not your friend.
He /she is not looking out for you but the company. 
Your goals need to align to his goals. 

He/she is not responsible for you but you company.

HR is not your friend.

You don't speak the truth to your boss
 You speak what he wants to hear.

Be diplomatic.  You have issues with work hours. 
Say
 "" I love my job, but it's exhausting to work 7 days a week, I need a break to reboot. I feel I can be more productive to the company by working extra during the 6 days and getting that one day off."" It seems that your boss is to some extent happy with you, and you aren’t a burden.

Looks like you have a work ethic as well- perhaps fewer street smarts or experience than you’d like. 

Your boss may well be right, he may well be wrong. It helps to look at objective facts.

First, you can take a day off- something that is incredibly helpful in simply staying sane. 

Having 7 day work weeks, unless you are in a rare few professions, is hard to justify.

About being destroyed - awesome! This will happen regularly, and it’s worth it as eventually you start picking up on resilience. Part of which is learning to actually value things you value. It sucks, but usually it’s either an issue of confidence or of new information which doesn’t sit well with you.

Practically, you can just shut up, get paid and get on with life.

But this depends on what goals you want to achieve.

So perhaps you could Grind it out, work towards being independent and then in a position when you can study whatever you like in peace.

Quitting a job is sometimes draining; in your case, it seems the emotional manipulation is happening because you can’t parse what is being said and place it between manipulation or advice from a more experienced person.

You are also very tired so decision making is going to be colored by that.

Do you like your work? Are you doing good work? Are you learning? Are you building a portfolio?

Your boss seems to be giving pretty decent advice on average.  he can be wrong - and that’s something you have to prove him wrong about in the long run, you don’t have to do it today. Don’t pressure yourself unnecessarily.

You have lots of challenges you are dealing with it seems, so give yourself a pat on the back for improving your work life balance and move towards getting that totally handled.

Take each day as it comes and build upwards.",2020-03-06 14:15:33
Scheduled,"AMA Announcement: Aatish Taseer, writer, journalist. December 27th, 9:30 PM IST (i.e. today!)",159,eg6zrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eg6zrz/ama_announcement_aatish_taseer_writer_journalist/,24,"Hello r/India,

Most of you are probably already familiar with Aatish and his writing. We invited him for an AMA and he agreed to do it. Aatish will be with us to answer questions and share his opinions on politics, the ongoing citizenship protests in India among other things. 

In case you are not familiar with his work please find some details below:

> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan

> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.
> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”
> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.

> On 8 November 2019, Taseer's Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to ""conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin"". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn't give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled ""India’s divider in chief"" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer's citizenship.

Questions/comments posted in this thread may go unnoticed by the guest.",anonymouse_2001," This should be interesting. Thanks for the heads up. Will look forward to this. Interesting guy. I saw [his Algebra interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7AerAWDrg) with Shoma Chaudhury just about a month ago. Can we just plead him to ask his mom not to write those sanghi apologetic pieces in Indian express anymore? Please. I mean come on, this shits gone on to hurt her son now. 

I agree its her personal opinion. As much as I also try to be empathetic towards the fact that there might have been some personal vendetta given the tavleen salman affair didn't end well enough, but her ""sympathizing, convincingly one sided arguments"" are nauseating, and they often provide fodder for the ""intentionally hate spewing bhakts"", who use her journalistic credibility to legitimize the nonsense that she writes and whitewash sanghs history. I have seen her articles nudge many a fence sitter towards the right, and the argument remains ""hey, but she's a liberal, isn't?"" 

I know I could have done better than not engaging in such personal stuff. It doesn't look or sound good, especially when someone's going to come in person for a one on one ask me anything. I am sure that the other Indian subreddits's users are going to be bigoted against him in the ama. Thank you I love how r/india is having such great peeps for AMAs! Look at the replies on his tweet. Sad. Your mother has endorsed RSS and Modi over her entire career as a journalist and she is actively propagating Islamophobic tweets from Tarek Fateh. You also endorsed Modi after his 2014 win and despised Arundhati Roy in past. My questions:

 \- I have a difficult environment at home due to polarity, is it same for you? If you are comfortable sharing it. But this is your personal matter and you can choose to ignore this question.

 \- What events moved your opinion from a pro-Modi in 2014 to writing your article in Time Magazine?

Questions I would like to ask. I hope to make it to the AMA. Cheers! [removed]",2019-12-27 13:32:45

I work 996 and life fucking sucks when you do it for a long time Well i don't know about China but in India, people travel 2-3 hours to Work so it ends up more than 12h everday if that counts Modi ji works for 16 hours a day and even if we assume one off day that's still considerably more than the 996 work schedule.

Scheduled,Mental Health Therapy service for NRIs,10,ffwh0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffwh0m/mental_health_therapy_service_for_nris/,7,"Hey Everyone,

**tl;dr – if you are like me, I want to arrange free online therapy for you (with a small catch).**

Big fan of this sub. It's been really great to read news about India and be able to discuss it. 

**About Me**

My name is Prakash. My family is from Kerala and I grew up in Hong Kong. After my primary and secondary school there, I ended up going to the Bay Area for university. After 7 years in the Bay, I moved back to India in order to work (believed that there were interesting things happening in consumer tech).

I’ve also had depression since I was 12, ended up getting hospitalized for it and then spent significant time figuring out how to manage it with a therapist.

What really helped me was moving back to India and being able to talk to a therapist who could understand the specific cultural issues that I was going through. I didn’t have the greatest relationship with my parents and it was sometimes really difficult to get a handle on my more negative thought patterns. My decision to move back to India was also really hard - lots of family members questioning my sanity and a lot of self doubt (am I stupidly just chasing risk?). Finally, I had a lot of insecurity about how I looked because I was usually the only brown person in the rooms I was moving in (and Hong Kong is not the most accepting place for people of colour).

**What I’m trying to do**

After having spent time both abroad and in India, I realized that there weren’t that many therapists abroad that could understand where I was coming from and that my Indian therapist was a lot more effective because of our shared cultural background.

I’m currently trying to see if other people feel this way, so here’s what I’m proposing -

Go to this website [www.talkfreely.uk](https://www.talkfreely.uk/) and sign up.

I’ll reach out to you via email and schedule a weekly online session with a therapist.

For the first 5 weeks, this service will be free, after which it will cost you roughly 20 pounds per hour (or your equivalent local currency).

In return, you and I jump on a short call every week so you can help me iron out the operational kinks. I want to get feedback on what’s effective and what’s not, so that I can make the service better.

**Caveats**

If you’re facing really SERIOUS depression or another serious mental health disorder, DO NOT use this service. You need to get professional help in person.

If you’re in the US, you unfortunately **can’t use** this service because of regulation. If you’re in the UK, Singapore, HK, Dubai…you’re fine. The pricing is set in pounds, but I'm happy to convert to the currency of your choice.",karna852, Upvoting for visibility. India is one of the most depressed nations in the world.

I always take the long route to do something. Donno why. It just ends up like that everytime.  Has anyone ever beaten their depression here? 
Or is it going to be a life long struggle of motivation - reality check -motivation repeat. How do you tell someone you care about, who's in their mid thirties to grow a spine and stop letting others take decisions that affect them? The person has lived a sheltered life where this has always been the modus operandi. I just feel like they're compromising so much because they don't know that they too have a voice, and a right to be happy. I'm confused whether I should try out antidepressants without prescription or not? I'm doing my CBT through a book called ""feeling good"" but I read it's best to take drugs as well.

Scheduled,Non-hiring someone because of his/her family name is considered as cast discrimination ?,65,d9f0sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d9f0sj/nonhiring_someone_because_of_hisher_family_name/,50,"Hi guys !

I was working for a French start-up in Bengaluru recently. One of my responsibility was to be a part of the recruitment team. 

Once, my boss refuses to hire someone because of his  family name/cast.

To tell you everything, he refuses to hire a ""Gowda"" because he wont fit in our team of low-cast villager people profile. 

(lets not discuss about hiring low-profile people from countryside because they are less complaining and more ""flexible"" to be polite)

Is that considered as cast discrimination by the law ?

What is your opinion about that ?  


I DONT MEAN TO OFFEND ANYONE OR ENCOURAGE ANY DISCRIMINATION.

In France, if this was written in a mail it could be enough to engage a court procedure definitely.",MM12300," Gowda is not a family name, it's a caste surname. This is definitely discrimination based on caste irrespective of the hierarchy or class. Are you French btw ? Yes, this is discrimination Yes, it is a caste based discrimination and is criminal. You could report him but I don't think much would happen. I'm confused as to what happened.

Are you saying that your boss wanted to hire low-caste people from a rural background, and rejected a ""Gowda"" because he didn't meet the profile? Your boss is an uneducated and uncultured asshole. Yes this is discrimination. Your boss probably didn't tell him that to his face because he knows it as well. Yes, it is discrimination, and you can call it out. Textbook definition of discrimination. Yes this is discrimination. What you do about it, is upto you. Thanks for all your comments.

I just wanna give you one last tip : never trust MNC or foreign companies from US and Europe.

This people have meeting to discuss cast issues/gender issues and how to manipulate employees to make them work as much as possible.

They will discuss how not to mix cast in offices to ensure peace, they will discuss how to hire farmers kids to make them feel proud to work for foreign companies even if you pay them less than people from cities. They will use all ""modern"" strategies or management such as promising you possibilities of going abroad when they know its impossible for you to go.

Trust yourself, work for Indians companies, settle your business but never run the rat race and give yourself to a MNC company.

Freedom to the people ! :) [deleted] Publicis Sapient? Yes this caste discrimination by law.

Gowdas are not low cast or from village. Most of them are Bangaloreans. This asshole works in a company in Bangalore but discriminates against native Bangaloreans wtf. Most of the Gowdas i know were nothing but helpful and hard working Your boss probably feels the job is best suited if someone from lower caste gets the job as higher caste people are “usually” richer and has a higher probability of changing the job. For example; a lower caste person will take up sewage cleaning job. A higher caste person will never do that. I may sound politically insensitive but that’s the truth. He would probably argue saying “he knows best” being a local.

Yes, that’s discrimination on your boss part. 

Which job profile is it?! If it was reversed I'd say yes. So no At large, law deems some sort of caste-based ""harassment"" as discrimination. This won't be deemed as caste discrimination legally.

An example, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/calling-an-sc-chamar-offensive-punishable-says-apex-court/articleshow/3382559.cms

What has happened in your company is something which happens daily with SC/ST candidates in other companies. It is caste discrimination, but not legally.

",garib_nawaz," No one talks about the shit quality of power in India

With summers around, voltage is going to fluctuate like crazy.  Heh. Right now I am at my native village, deep inside Assam, for a few days (Bihu festival). Three days ago there was rain and strong winds and the electric wires messed up. Which led to the only transformer supporting nearby villages go kaput. Found out that other 3 transformers were already broken and the block development office didn't care to fix it and transferred all load to one transformer. 

Right now power is being routed from another district for 30 minutes at an interval of 2 hours. 

Last year Jan-Feb same shit happened. The BD people even had the audacity to ask villagers to raise money to repair the transformers. The villagers lived without electricity for 2 months. 

And if you remember right, our dear *pradhan sevak* was trumpeting 'cashless' in Nov '16. People don't have electricity and phones and internet and that national idiot wants 'cashless' economy. 

And it's not like there were no online transactions before the 2016 disaster. Being in big cities since childhood, I've seen father wire money since the '90s. I have had credit cards since 2011. 

Ugh, the facade.  Can't you even arrange an Inverter/UPS, you anti-nashunal? /s Isnt power regulated by the state government?
That's how it is in  Kerala so I don't know about the rest. Not to mention the fact that internet is turned off at the slightest sign of unrest. How dare you blame this on my Mudi ji. You just wait and see the power surplus we'll have in this country once the cowdung to electricity production research begins. He is trying to make India digitalised without any power supply.Hats off to you the great shameless PM ever. Even Motabhai's Reliance fails to provide round-the-clock power in Mumbai in the summer. I feel your pain /u/garib_nawaz. I had to go through some ordeal a few months back due to how well planned Modi's Digital India programme is. Here is the post I wrote about it:
[""Light Nahi Hai"" (There's No Electricity)- A true Digital India Story](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7ezbxg/light_nahi_hai_theres_no_electricity_a_true/) Which city are you talking about? What are you talking about? We have greatest technology from centuries! Don't complain. Use gaumutra and cow dung to generate electricity!  There is a power cut every day in Bangalore - the IT capital of the country. You can't really fault Modi for this, its the states job to provide power. Power is one of the few areas where Modi govt. has done a good job.

In any case, I think a cheaper option is to just remove your dependence on always-on power. Junk your desktop and move to a laptop. Get a jio connection for phone internet. Get a USB power bank - they are cheap and huge. Nowadays you can get lights and fans also which run on USB. You dont really need always-on power anymore. kaun se gaon me hai be bimari tu? Pune checking in ! 8 hours on thursdays(10-12 times unscheduled per week) . Sometimes the power cut is 8 hours in main city of Jaipur. Capital of Rajasthan. Padharo Maare Des. We aspire to move to first world services while being bogged down with third world problems. Simply can't happen. 

Electricity is the first thing we need to do at least generate a proper invoice to be tax compliant. After stabilizing on that, then we can think of uninterrupted 4G/broadband connectivity for cashless transactions. Use weed energy. Writing this from the financial capital of India. No power cuts here so far. There must be some fault in your Taars. Can't blame Modi for everything. ""Way too hot outside \- Let's Blame Modi"" Why can't you get online? Use Weed Energy. This is another variation of probably the oldest Indian problem, make policies/rules without thinking of implementation/infrastructure. We are responsible for shit quality electricity in India. Dont blame the govt present or past  for shit electricity for this Why don't you get a silent petrol/diesel generator like the one from kirloskar? If you're running a legit business you must invest in power backup.

Since it makes negligible noise nobody would have an issue. The mentality of some people in the comments is laughable.
Attribute the good,deflect the bad.Waah Inverters / generators are the norm today. Almost everyone in my family got one when they were getting their homes built. You cant stay without a fan in 40C + weather Why you catch when Modi throws The issue is not generation of power.We can generate surplus till the cows come home,but what happens when the infrastructure to distribute is crumbling(For your information,Discoms are a state subject).Privatization of distribution is the answer(Mumbai/Delhi discoms are privatized.I had a generator in Mumbai which was not run on load for 35 years,had to scrap it as parts were obsolete).Also,commercial areas are the first to be cut as residential have a higher priority.If its a scheduled power cut then there might be some maintenance happening.

Yes,we are headed towards being a cashless society but please be patient.We have miles to go..can't do it by blaming everything. Burn this anti national.

Modi ji made Xiaomi go *Make in India*. Why are you not using their powerbanks?

Don't blame Modi ji for everything. He has a lot more important matters to settle in the UK Completing your stuffs online is an option not an compulsion. Modi - the guy is out of touch with reality. Decentralized solar power is the only way to go. Assume that off-grid is the norm and the grid will only be available sporadically :-( The time you took to write this rant and the responses, you could have completed 2 - 3 banking transactions. So silly right?, why do banks have online transaction features. Shut it down. 


> this is in a prime commercial areas in a very important tier-1 industrial city. 

Since the city is not mentioned here, and blame directly goes on Modi. I think this one must be a non BJP ruling state. 
 Ups owners master race Blame your municipal body, not Modiji. Why do you need power, when it is scheduled power cut, charge your laptop and phones to full before that, and use 4g mobile hotspot. Many people do this for work from home.",2018-04-17 13:18:20
Scheduled,I subscribed to Scripbox 3 months ago and since then have invested around 10k in the long term investment plans. The value of my investments never went above 10k. Now they're 9.3k. I'm scheduled to make my next payment soon. What do?,14,85peql,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/85peql/i_subscribed_to_scripbox_3_months_ago_and_since/,29,I'm losing faith in Scripbox. I joined it because people on reddit keep talking non-stop about how good it is. ,SoulsBorNioh," Mutual funds are subject to market risks please read..... > long term investment    
> 3 months First, relax. If you are investing for long term, never track progress daily and it will never be accurate of your final returns. Log in every month or so if you are anxious. I typically check every six months of how my portfolio is doing and rebalance once a year if required. The long term investment is a game of patience.

Scripbox is okay and sells regular funds. I and /r/IndiaInvestments would normally recommend a direct fund option but as you are new and so anxious on a small dip, I would recommend to stick with Scripbox as they (apparently) do rebalancing for you and tax optimized exit load. I have seen their recommended funds and they are good. Keep doing the investments. Also /r/IndiaInvestments  The market is down OP.  Frequent /r/IndiaInvestments, really helpful community. Started my MF investments by taking guidance from them.

Since most of the comments have already answered your question. Let me share an interesting point from an [article](https://eightytwentyinvestor.com/2018/03/11/dude-shall-i-cut-my-equity-exposure/) i got from that sub recently.

> A high equity allocation also comes with the caveat that you must be mentally prepared for a 50% correction once in 5-7 years, 25-30% correction once every 3 years and 10% correction every year (all these are rough estimates and not cast in stone)

That's how markets work, stick for the long haul (10+ years) and you'll reap it's benefits! You have essentially invested when the market was at all time peak and started comparing when markets started slow downward slide in last month or so. Even the best funds show negative results for short span of time of 3 months including a peak and a dip. 

Keep on investing small amounts and check only over long periods of time. At least 3 or 6 months to readjust your SIP's yearly. are you stupid op? the entire market has gone down in the last 3 months. what does that have to with scripbox? You chose to invest at a wrong time. You probably invested at the top. People have been searching for a fund which can beat the market but nah no one can escape the markets reality, unless you have contacts with warren buffet, george soros or Jim simons..and copy their portfolio..
>I subscribed to Scripbox 3 months ago

Indian market has been doing shit all since two months(following the US market) and maybe the next next leg of downturn has started. So scripbox is doing nothing magical but following the market.

the best bet for a lay investor who is not timing the market is SIP.. 6% drawdown in last 3 months seems par for the course given how markets have fared. No fault lies with scripbox here. Don't stop your lont term investments after 3 months.

Although, I would suggest moving to Direct plans instead of regular. Head over to /r/indiainvestments and go through the wiki. are you investing in regular plan with scripbox ? switch to direct plan  Always benchmark your portfolio against a similar investment in the index.. Your portfolio should outperform the index at least 70% of the time to make good the higher costs and selection risk 

An absolute comparison will not tell you if Scripbox made bad choices or not",2018-03-20 10:38:34

In my experience after a while people just want to have steady income without too many challenges. It is the stage where lot of people in a way accept that this is all life is going to be. Not if you are actually working. all you need to chase your boredom away is to get a huge loan or have monthly bills to pay :) Nopes. Reach office by 9 am, work for 2.5 hours, play snooker from 11 to 12:30 pm, then lunch and chit chat till 1:30, work from 2 to 5 pm, then go out to play till 6:30. Then gym till 8 pm. Have dinner and then sometimes I work from 10 to 12 am and then sleep. Wake up at 8 and repeat. 

I enjoy it. Also, approx working hours come around 6 in a day and that are enough if I have full concentration. Rest somedays are rest days in gym so working hours increase. 

Edit: Grammer and spellings. Pardon my grammer, am on mobile.  Not really.
If your work is interesting, or challenging, it's not boring. If it is boring, seek a new job, or do something on your off time that is interesting.

I work a very boring job, so I write and read in my free time, and exercise a bit to lose all the flab.

Some write poetry, watch movies, learn to cook fun stuff on a limited budget, etc. It all depends on what you make of your day. Life is dull dude. Depends on your work. My friend runs a tech-design studio in New Delhi. Our work is really cool. We travel a lot, for business discussions and pitching potential clients. My bills keep the boredom away. My own work, keeps me quite busy. Its a bit stressful most days, but generally quite engaging. I mostly don't particularly enjoy it anymore. But it literally helps me pay the bills... So...  
If I do quit work, things wouldn't be too bad. (I've already had quite a few years of sitting at home doing nothing - I basically spent most of my time at home during college days, so I know a thing or two about wasting time, and how I handle it)..

But the fact that I loose my standing in society can be irksome.  Its a decent job as well, so I'd be loathe to give it up easily I suppose.

But yes, the stress is starting to get to me. So maybe I just might.  
Some of my colleagues who have quite a bit of repetitive jobs have told me that they find their work utterly boring and soul crushing. Thankfully, I have hobbies. It has slowly dawned on me that I am reaching my saturation point with this job if I do not take immediate measures to fix this. I'm the only dev remaining in this team, and my colleague needs help often.

Now I'm hopping between reddit, articles, writing code and just wasting time. So I have to suck it up and finish the damn task No, if you slack you will get bored, there's always something to do.",2018-10-29 17:19:54

Does anyone still play **candy crush**? When everyone fell off the bandwagon, I kept with it. Around Level 300 or so. It makes for a lovely bathroom/waiting room/restaurant wait time!  deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8362  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/33628) [deleted] Playing **Bioshock Infinite** on PS3. The visuals are amazing especially the floating city of Columbia, the shooting is very satisfying and the story is engrossing with parallel universes forming an important part of the story. All in all, well worth for the price and time. Borderlands 2 has a huge discount on steam.  My question is can I play coop?  After all these years do people play it? Anyone else wanna play with me?  I can't believe I have 91 games on steam. :)

That sounds cool (Hopefully I don't get banned)..

Back onto playing Skyrim with mods. Tried Skyrim SE, but somethings are broken. Not sure why. :/

Bought 3 games during steam sale, I wonder if I will ever try them... Looking to play a few games that could run on a 750M with 2GB of GDDR5. Any suggestions? I want to play Witcher 3 so bad but the experience will be piss poor. 

EDIT: Decent CPU: 2.5 Ghz I7-4870HQ.

Will Middle earth shadow of mordor run fine? Finishing shadow of Mordor dlc now. Also having fun with rocket league and CS go though the lag is frustrating. Got ac3 for free on Uplay and purchased Arkham Knight premium during winter sale.

My backlog is in excess of 250 games so I can hold off till summer. 

Glad that Paytm works finally.  just got back to *CS;GO* since i nu maal these days ;( I recently played **AntiChamber**. It's a mindfuck of a game. Short but a really great experience.

Also downloaded and played **Hearthstone**  for the first time this week in spite of never being a fan of TCG. It actually seems really fun. I am not that good at it but still having fun.
 on PS3, finished Assassin's Creed - II.

Picked up Borderlands-II Recently completed The Evil Within. It's a survival horror by the creator of resident evil, Shinji Mikami. The game is tough but worth playing if you're a fan of horror. I should mention that the optimization of the game is not great.
Currently, playing its DLC: The Assignment. Not to initiate console wars but, 

PS4 or PS4 Pro? 

Look, I don't have 4K TV, and this is a very belated birthday gift to my brother.  So your recommendations would be great. If I can share it with him, I will probably want to restart playing **Assassin's Creed 3** and continue the series. 

 I know gamers don't really like mobile games, but I played the second version of an old game **Hill Climb Racing 2** and it's just soo much better and fun! The Marion Run style multiplayer mode is amazing and worth a try.

Also, has anyone played **Don Bradman Cricket 17** yet? Waited for official launch of Pokemon Go, it's finally here. Walking 10+ km everyday because of it. But sadly no players around, also too few pokestops. Barcelona finally pass like they're Barcelona in FIFA 17.I love giving through balls in it. [deleted] Bought the [New THQ Classics](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/123985/) bundle.

9 (well, *technically* 10)games for 348 rupees. Absolute steal. Playing destiny as always. Also bought fifa 17 on Christmas sale. Planning to start witcher 3. Any ps4 players out here? Far Cry 4. Can anybody suggest a good city builder (apart from sim city or city skylines) or a good simulation game. Xbox One Gamer here, been playing The Division's survival for the past week, so far its has been a blast. Will be jumping into
World of Tanks too.   What old games can I play well on an Intel HD5500 8gb RAM? (other than notepad)  Gta 5 online is the best experience I've had a long with black ops 2. I suggest you find a couple of friends and just play the heists, it's very rewarding and fun. Except for the part where the game is 60% loading screens  Anyone play Guild Wars 2? Its a pretty casual game, unlike most MMOs.

Also, PvP season 5 is on right now which is pretty fun if you are into PvP. I just started The Book of Unwritten Tales. The game looks promising. It's a point-and-click game with a lot of the kind of humour where people say stupid shit which we know is stupid but they don't... except, it isn't stupid in the in-game universe, because it's actually fucking true there! Go figure, huh?  Summoner Wars. Very good game. :) Anyone play **the Binding of Isaac** here?

Currently playing the awesome community made mod Antibirth and holy shit it's awesome! Try it out if you like Isaac!

Btw got semi-pro Yesterday on **Rocket league!** :D

Anyone wanna multiplayer? I would like to recommend overwatch, great game, even greater with friends to play with, i would buy it any price without thinking. 
But heres how you can buy for 1300rs till 3rd jan, create a new battle net account, select argentina as your country, play in 299 ARS..and you are good to go, you just bought the cheapest possible copy of overwatch, pm me if you need more help Buying games like a madman in the Steam winter sale. Currently playing Mafia 3 on PC. Game is good, but nowhere near the polish of gta 5. Voice acting and visuals are top notch, but gameplay gets stale after a while. 

Also bought a ton of platformers to play on my old Laptop. Playing Ori and the blind forest and Hell Yeah right now. 

Picked up a Red Gear Pro series wireless controller for the home rig and a 6 month old Logitech F710 wireless controller that I got off Olx to play on my laptop.  anybody who plays Battlefield 3 multiplayer here ? Any CoC or Clash Royale players here? Did you like the new update? any mini militia players here? I mostly play mobile games. I highly recommend playing **crashlands**. Also **Clarc**. These two are easily the best gaming experiences I've had on phone. Currently I'm playing dead effect 2. While it's an interesting story and well made game and it's free too, what I hate about it is that unless you pay for credits and game money, its difficultly level is super high for me.",2016-12-26 14:17:28

Scheduled,What kind of a doctor or treatment do I seek for Sleep Disorder?,13,f3qvfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f3qvfw/what_kind_of_a_doctor_or_treatment_do_i_seek_for/,9,"My sleep timings are 4AM to 11AM. I cannot fall asleep before 4AM and if I force myself up before 11AM it is always with a headache that lasts thought the day.

It began back in 2013 with a night shift job. I did the shift for a year but when I left the company my sleep schedule stayed the same. And now even after 7 years it is the same. Even I am to blame since after I left the job I did not try to fix my sleep times and prolonged it.

Since I am a freelancer now it doesn't affect my work but it is affecting all other aspects of my life. At times if I have to be up early I'm just miserable and cranky the whole day.

What can I do about it? What treatment works or what kind of a doctor should I see?",fbenmart," Try having melatonin pills just an hour before you intend to sleep. If that doesn't works, consult a doctor. Our sleep is dependent on Melatonin. And Melatonin depends on light. In natural conditions (no artificial light), Melatonin starts rising after 19:30/20:00 and peaks in the middle of the night (~ 03:00) and goes down by 07:30/08:00. [Note that the level rises over 7 hours but goes down in 4/5 hours.] As the level starts rising we start feeling sleepy. 

This is a natural cycle, which we can vary but this is something that is deeply encoded within us. We ideally shouldn't mess with this and neither mess by taking Melatonin Pills.

Another factor is the Deep Sleep/Rapid Eye Movement cycles which adapt based on your sleep duration. 

Based on the above factors and disregarding ideal conditions, this is the ideal sleep pattern:
1. The middle of the night (~ 03:00) should coincide with the middle of your sleep. 
2. Your waking time should not vary by more than half an hour, the sleeping time has more flexibility. Changing the waking time messes the Deep Sleep / REM Cycle. 

As an example, taking 6 hours of sleep, 00:00 - 06:00 is the best. For a good, 7/8 hours sleep, 23:00 - 07:00 / 22:30 - 07:00 would be the best. 


Consider the further as a Tl;dr: 

Now coming to your exact problem, if you want to solve your problem in a proper way, you need to have patience and take appropriate steps.

Decide a time you want to sleep and limit light in your environment, 2-3 hours prior with a special focus on screen brightness, filters etc. Then at your decided time, switch off the lights, switch off all screens. (If you aren't feeling sleepy, you can listen to music, even listen to movies/TV Shows/ Audio Books etc. Remember, Light is the priority.) Then no matter when you fall asleep, decide a time and get up at that moment. 

Then, during the day, do not take more than 30-45 minutes nap in the afternoon, fight off the sleep (not by OD'ing on Caffeine). Automatically, you will feel sleepy earlier the next night.

This will cause discomfort for a few days but within a few days (if everything is done right, less than a week) you will have a new sleep cycle. 
Point in favor, People who live for months in a different time zone, get over Jet Lag and get acclimatized in a few days. You cannot change your sleeping patterns overnight. Take baby steps, try sleeping at 3AM first and do that for a couple of weeks, then change it 2 and so on until you reach your desired goal. Make sure you tire yourself throughout the day, exercise, go to the gym, run, do anything than be idle all day. Go to a psychiatrist first. They'll try to find the root cause and refer you accordingly. Supplement glycine and magnesium. Use magnesium in form of magnesium citrate or magnesium glycinate. 

Take 400 mg magnesium daily with dinner and 3-5 gran glycine daily at night. 

Also take a little warm milk with turmeric at night. Meet a doctor from medicine department. 

If required you will be sent to neuro for checkup.",2020-02-14 19:25:11

Also, /r/CrackWatch is on a roll. Played some  really different games. Playing **Life is Strange**

Completed Episode 4. The game affects me like no other game. Its too close to life. And way too tough for players to make decisions. playing **Uncharted 3**. Almost at the end i guess.

**Bioshock** is next in line. Finished **Alien: Isolation**. Best survival horror since Dead Space. 10/10 for the sheer terror factor. I got it for cheap (Rs. 160) from steam. Civ V.

Quit the map* after getting nuked by Elizabeth while fending off Gandhi at the same time.

Might start a new game of Civ this friday. Play as Genghis fucking khan and show them who's their daddy.  My Witcher 3 addiction shows no sign of stopping. 

Also playing Resident Evil 7, and bought the 1999 game Urban Chaos yesterday from the Square Enix sale. I remember playing this game for hours.  Started Witcher 3 again. I recently gave up on Overwatch due to reasons so just trying to fill the void by playing one of my favorite games of all time.  Played **Crusader Kings 2**. Lost chance to become Emperor of Deccan. Fuck Rashtrakutas.     Looking for some people to play DotA 2 with. Current MMR fluctuating around 3.9k. Looking for some fun games in the SEA server. Un-installed steam and some 200 gb worth of games today. I have been addicted to gaming since ages i think its time to move on! Started playing **Fallout: New Vegas** last weekend. Since there is a lot of travel, I am playing it pretty slow and trying to complete quests in an area before proceeding further.

**FIFA 17** and **Stardew Valley** as gap-fillers. Playing **Alto's Adventure** on android. Loving it so far. [deleted] Playing **Rocket League** these days. It's a pretty fun game. I like to play online but I get such bad ping. Most of the times it's between 150-200 and that's playable I suppose. I am invoker Started playing **Doom (2016)**. The download size seemed daunting at first but two nights of jio unlimited nighttime later I'm ripping and tearing my way through Mars.  Definitely lives up to the hype, it's refreshing to see somewhat complex map design again in singleplayer fpses. It's also amazing how decent it runs on my toaster of a laptop. The difficulty is somewhat on the easy side on the default difficulty but I don't want to wade into a higher difficulty without one vanilla playthrough and seeing what the different enemy types and weapons are. 

Also dipped into **battlefield 1**(singleplayer campaign only because *coughcough*) . The series had never interested me (my internet speeds had always been too shit for multiplayer) but the ww1 setting sure piqued my interest. The campaign is way too short but it's interesting to see far cry style stealth-through-bases gameplay (albeit too simplified) instead of missions where you can't even go ten steps away from the scripted path. The Lawrence of Arabia campaign was an aesthetic I longed to see in videogames for an eternity and it was decent enough(some real mgs tpp vibes). After hearing so much about it, I've begun playing **Kerbal Space Program**. 

It's...a lot more complicated than I thought it'd be. I'm also glad I'm not in charge of the ISRO. 

RIP little Jebediah, who died because I didn't understand the staging process, which resulted in your little parachute being incinerated by the boosters.  [Pretty badass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTRppi351O0) sounding trailer for an indie-game in development by a Bangalore team

 [deleted] [deleted] Playing **FarCry 4** and **Rocket League** with occasional **Dota 2**. FarCry is pretty fun but it's too long for my comfort. Also, dying to play **Overwatch** but no moniez saar :'(. Playing **Mario Maker** on CEMU (v 1.7.1) works pretty great at stable 60 fps on my PC at least. Will try **Bayonetta 2** on Cemu when v1.7.2 is released. Anyone played for honor yet?  What's the server status like for you?  Finished Dying Light. Planning to get dark souls 3 Playing gta 5, bought it recently and don't have any friends so doing moding offline and btw if someone interested and can play with me online personal sessions, i would love to be friends. But i should warn you im pretty new :) maybe will try making YouTube videos. Playing counter strike 1.6. Mostly on weekends. Does anyone here play? I play mostly on igc servers Bought HITMAN^TM , spent 8 hours on the two prologue levels. I need to get myself up and try finish The Witcher 3 and Life is Strange. Playing Overwatch , reached diamond from Bronze this season, I WILL be a top 500 player next season, I Need be a top 500 player next season, 

Currently watching Surefour and practicing edge positioning. Bought a new ps4 pro and tried bloodborne. Fucking difficult game  Playing Resident Evil 7, WWE2K17, and have some Visual Novels on hold. Got the humble freedom bundle. Playing random things from there. So many cool games! **Invisible Inc**, **Sproggiwood**, and **2064: Read only memories**. I'll be checking out the other games over the next few weeks. I am currently playing Far Cry 3 in warrior mode... Thats my hobby, play games in most difficult mode. Anyone sharing same interest?? I recently discovered a cool indie game called Foxhole on steam. It's gor a persistent war going on and manages to simulate war-time logistics quite well.  Just ended Rise of the Tomb Raider!
 Got really addicted to **Warframe**. This game is seriously amazing. Currently Mastery rank 7. Looking for some friends, ign- HuntingLion (yeah I really like the name :P ) Anyone playing **Paladins**? I'm 350 hrs into the game. It's pretty fun f2p. Playing **For Honor**. It's nice, when it works. buy it if you like fighting games. 1v1 and 2v2 are the best modes. Dont bother with 4v4 I'm quite shameless to admit that I only play Overwatch, though looking forward to Mass Effect Andromeda. Also have to play Dishonored 2, as the 1st was really fucking good. Installed bunch of Indie games and played few of them and sadly i stopped playing all of them in 4 hrs. 

Started with **Monaco** and after few mins i started to hate those colours. Made me dizzy. Uninstalled. 

Next up **Metal Slug 3** was playing the last mission and i had power cut. Saves gone :(. Uninstalled.

Next one **Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet**. Loved it initially. Then encountered boss fights. Defeated one and then encountered another boss. Failed 8 times. Raged quit. Uninstalled.

Last one **The Swapper**. Loved it initially. I then realized iam not smart enough for puzzles games and i hate puzzles and platformers games. Uninstalled. 
 Got Rise of Tomp Raider for Rs 400. Gifted one for an old friend too. Felt good.

Also got Humble Bundle Freedom. Crafted a shitload of badges on steam lol. It was something like 50 games. Darksouls 3 and the new Hitman. Civilization V has destroyed me whole weekend halfway through **COD Black Ops 3** campaign. Can't wait to join multiplayer and get absolutely butchered to pieces. 

Also, anyone interested in a lengthy destiny raid this weekend? I have a mic and don't play annoying music. PSN: toothpaste4dinnr",2017-02-20 13:06:01

Naturalisation (Section 6)

Citizenship of India by naturalization can be acquired by a foreigner (not illegal migrant) who is ordinarily resident in India for TWELVE YEARS (throughout the period of twelve months immediately preceding the date of application and for ELEVEN YEARS in the aggregate in the FOURTEEN YEARS preceding the twelve months) and other qualifications as specified in Third Schedule to the Act. Application shall be made in Form-XII.",entirepolscience," Best explanation of CAA-NRC I have seen. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTJVQFymMkM To be naturalised you need to be a foreigner holding valid travel documents and residency permits. The unclear status of those excluded from Assam NRC is an indicator of the widespread chaos that would follow a nation wide exercise. Even if we accept that they'll get citizenship in 11 years, where do bhakts think they'll be house?

In concentration camps.

For 11 fucking years. It's called citizenship by naturalization. If any foreigner is a citizen of India for 11 years and one year after application then he will be considered Indian citizen. This duration was changed to 5 years for Hindu, Christians, Sikh etc of countries from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan in the current CAA 2019

Rocket league 


Insurgency 


 Battlefield One.

Holy shit, best fps ive ever played. I took a break from my usual indie fares and played a bit of AAA games this week -

**Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition**

A great rpg if there was ever one. Best played with a friend in coop.

**Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Seige**

A first person multiplayer tactical shooter by Ubisoft. Better CSGO imo(no hate pls)

**Overwatch**

Dove back into this after Sombra's release. Ended up playing as Soldier 76 anyway.

**Civilization VI**

Article on game we are working on.

If you are interested in updates about the game please like us on fb https://m.facebook.com/legendofabhimanyu/ Viva La France DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 is coming out on Dec 5. http://store.steampowered.com/app/531130/

The game auto updated to v1.26 yesterday so I won't be able to play the Multiplayer for a week or two I recently discovered this site: gamexs dot in, good collection of secondhand Xbox One & PS4 games for a decent price. The Call of Duty games have always had fun single-player campaigns IMO but I've never wanted to pay full price just for the campaigns - so I managed to buy them all off this site and played through all of them.

MS released the Mass Effect trilogy playable on Xbox One and I had EA Access so got all of them for free. I was a penniless college student when they came out and I never played any of the DLC for 2 & 3, so I paid for all the story DLC and started with ME2, starting with a default background. This has turned out to be a mistake because Ashley and Wrex are dead. Wrex I can maybe live without but it was really hard to get over not having Ashley around (she is Shepard's bae in my playthroughs) plus Kaidan is generally an asshole. I played through ME2 anyway and somehow got Jack killed, which was another blow. Unfortunately, when I went to cure the genophage in ME3, I realised that because I chose to save Maelon's data Eve was alive, so I couldn't convince Mordin to pretend to cure the genophage. I had to make the hard choice, I had to do it. I couldn't let Urdnot Wreav start the Krogan Rebellions again. I had to kill Mordin Solus.

I had to stop playing after that. Now I'm going to have to go back to ME1, and keep Wrex alive and let that asshole Kaidan die, as a bonus I get to keep the rachni around as well. Sigh. Nobody here keen on playing Watch Dogs 2? Any 3DS users here? I've been hooked to the new Pokémon for a week now. Great new addition to the series I recently started playing Borderlands and Mirrors Edge again. In love with these games.

Also, does anyone play War Thunder ? Mass Effect Andromeda !!! Neverwinter Nights is available for free on Gog.com for anyone interested in RPGs like Baldur's gate. **Bloodborne complete edition**   Enjoying the shit out of it. 

Also started **undertale**  loving it so far. 

**Overwatch** is on back-burner.  Democracy 3. Solved crime problem in the country, had a surplus budget, made an internationally competitive economy. Suddenly environment pollution causes health crisis, worked doctors overtime, doctors strike. Lost election. Hopefully history would remember me well.  I've recently started with Prey. Holy shit, this game is crazy! **Critical Ops** on Android.

Counter Strike/Urban Terror inspired multiplayer FPS.

Really polished game and developers are quite active. Servers are always packed. I only play 10 minute deathmatch games and they are quite fun.

IAPs are just optional weapon skins and the game can be played without them.

On screen controls takes a bit getting used to. There is no controller support as of now.

As with all multiplayer FPS games, you will need low ping. My ping is around 80 on an average I can play without any lag.

Oh, and loadout is same for everyone. The game is cross platform (iOS, Android and PC). If you play on your smartphone, make sure not to play with PC players as they have better controls. I started Playing Rome Total war: Gold  Edition, I keep getting massacred by Gauls and Germans in the forests Rainbow six siege , multiplayer done right !!! **Titanfall 2**. Picked up, great campaign and multiplayer is oodles of fun. I just love how *fast* everything seems while not being taxing or requiring absurd APM.

To take a break from that, I'm playing **Planet Coaster**. Finishing up the scenarios and such. This is a worthy successor to RCT3, but I feel that it lacks a certain...depth to the management aspect in the Challenge mode. More custom scenarios where you start off in a bad situation are helpful. People have done incredible things with it, but it takes time to build something breathtaking. /r/GlobalOffensive, Hooked. How is Overwatch compared to cod infinite warfare and titanfall ? Immensely disappointed this time . Ummm. Zombie highway 2.  Civ 6

its awesome

The indian music is particular great, and evolves really nicely. Been giving halo reach some love... **The Witcher 2** and **Life is Strange**. I bought The Witcher 3 as well, but I'm waiting till I finish my Witcher 2 so I can port the save over. I bought Life is Strange Episode 1 months before it became free. Still need to buy the DLC, but out of funds. Bought a whole bunch of games in the Autumn sale. Still haven't finished the games from Summer sale. Currently playing Fallout 4, it's ok, the engine has some technical issues, but looks nice and some good QoL changes. Also playing Gears of War 4 in parallel, loads of fun. Total war series but Shogun 2 and FOTS are my favorites. Finally might win Dog in 2 at tough difficulty :D

Next in line is Wargame European Escalation. 
 

All while my Laundry Piles up & my employees think am on drugs because I have been running on less than 4hrs of sleep since last week :) 
 I had a question regarding FIFA 16 guys. Do you know if i can play FIFA 16 over PC with my friends? 
 i'm going to install Ubuntu on my laptop and I wanted to know whether CSGO is supported on it?  I recommend you guys give **no man's sky** a try (or another try) after the new foundation update they game has become pretty awesome, 

also does anyone here play **blizzard** games like **WoW** or **overwatch** me and my friends are avid wow players we've been playing the game for about 3 years, 

we're on US sargeras and we raid with the guild currently lagging we raid every Saturday and Sunday evenings(Indian time) if you wanna join us or just want someone for overwatch and some random dungeons and stuff hit me up, we also try do at least a mythic +8 every week 

Bnet tag - Ghostdragon#129948 I am currently playing The Witcher and GTA. I know they are old but I love them.

Anyone here has tried the skyrim for xbox? I have the PS4, a friend of mine is coming down from the US in a week, I can get the Xbox One S for around 250. Is it worth it? Very confused on what to do... Are there good enough exclusives?  I usually pirate games, but I lost patience and finally bought **Hitman 2016**.

Totally worth every single rupee. Bought Crusader Kings 2 coz of reddit recommendations and the fact that it was on sale.

Slightly taken back by the learning curve... Has someone here played it before ? I just started playing **Dead Space**. Holy shit is the atmosphere and the music creepy. Thing is the enemies are not tough to deal with but hearing metal pipes clanging, chains rattling and sounds of things moving in vents above gives me anxiety. I sometimes take a 5 minute break to calm myself down. I haven't finished the game yet but so far it's one of the best games I've played.

Also, I play **Borderlands 2** from time to time since it's an overall awesome game. If anyone wants to co-op in BL2, PM me for my steam username. PSN is having a 12 days of christmas sale and they also have buy 1 get one free on their games. Personally, I'd like to sell my pre-ordered copy of Infinite warfare.  Any good multiplayer games me and my friends can play? Apart from Overwatch, Battlefield and GTA? CS GO, Reflex, Hitman, XCOM 2 ,Factorio,Shenzen I/O Mirrors Edge Catalyst. Coming back after finishing Uncharted 4, the controls feel a bit weird and still getting used to. Great looking game but I find it hard to imagine that I'd be marathoning an entire Sunday like I did for Uncharted 4. cant wait to buy and play overwatch,fifa 17 and battlefield 1 but sbi dc doesnt work on any site ",2016-12-01 20:40:03

[All scheduled threads.](https://sd.reddit.com/r/india/search?q=flair%3AScheduled+-title%3ARandom&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all/#sd)",root_su," Anyone else addicted to Football manager?  Just started playing the metal gear series on ps3 and 4. 6 games to go.  been getting back into super old school text adventures. The advantage is the graphics processor is your brain and not limited by current technology or cost.

Other advantage is you can play it while in office.

I have been replaying [Counterfeit Monkey by Emily Short](http://emshort.com/counterfeit_monkey/) last week. you have a device that can remove letter from the objects. So removing ""x"" from **codex**, gives you **code** to open the door. you can make **garage** from **garbage** and **car** from **chard**. 

The story is very interesting. It has multiple possible endings and there are lot of achievements to get. Its fun to see what objects you can make in this world. So replay-ability value is very high.

It will be most appreciated by Language nerds and computer nerds alike. Okay. So this may not be your typical comment, please be kind :)   
I'm looking to get back into gaming after a really really long time. The last games that I played were the first Assassin's Creed, the old NFS:Shift/Undercover/World titles and such (read games from '08).  
  
So first up, PC or console? I've only ever played on a PC (that I built). If i'm not mistaken (and please correct me here), many titles are console-specific. So, X-Box? PS4? Or PC?  
  
And some good titles to get started?  
**Edit:** And for online gaming, what typical internet speeds would be required? Playing Uncharted 2. I would never stop being amazed at whatever Naughty Dogs develop. Not a single moment of boredom in the game. 
Also playing Hitman (2016), the number ways you can kill your target is more than enough to warrant 30+ hours in the game. The very definition of a fun game.  Give a shot to **War Thunder**.  Much more realistic than world of tanks,  has air, ground and naval (in beta)  and feels much more satisfying. 

Cons: the grind is real in tier4 tanks. Russian developers,  who do stupid things at times. Cyka blyat.  [removed] **Attention Smartphone Gamers**, could you tell the game you're hooked on playing right now? Trying out this game called Aragami. Pretty cool stealth game. Basically, you're some sort of a shadow ninja. Haven't played much of it though. Other games in the pipeline include Metro 2033 and MGS: The Phantom Pain. Nothing but Overwatch for the past couple of months. PM me for battletag. 

Finished Inside and Child of Light on the side. Both way shorter than I would like them and not as difficult as you'd expect them to be. But both are fantastic with their own charm.

Played a bit of Super Meat Boy. It's definitely an intense and old-school-difficult game.

Really want to return to Smite, but just too lazy to learn the S4 meta considering I barely played S3. Stardew Valley. Started playing it in the first week of Jan and already 50+ hours into it. Still so much to do. 

Very relaxing and addictive :-) Awesome, reading all you guys' responses here! 

Just upgraded from an xbox 360 to a PS4. Borrowed a fifa16 from my friend, waiting on an f17 after my boards and looking at the PS4 exclusives to get later on. My brother would want Assassins, RDR, Unchartered 4, COD MW, will look at Forza for a racing game, maybe Mortal Kombat too. 

- which exclusive titles for the PS4 should I go for? 
- I should have over 35 titles for the xbox, 30 should be in great condition. My friends are recommending OLX to sell it off, what do you think?
- lol I'll make a PSN soon, any of you guys play f16?

Also, the Nintendo Switch will release on march 3, I was thinking of getting one since it's kinda inexpensive and gaming on the go! What did you guys think of it as a console/handheld hybrid? And the expected price range? I know it's got limited games rn but I hope Nintendo will extend that later on.  Just started a play through of Skyrim. And holy hell what a game. This is seriously the best game I've ever played. Almost every character interaction has a story. The environment is beautiful. And the RPG elements are bang on.  Waiting for Abzu and Subnautica Just finished a run of Mass effect 3 yesterday. Can't wait for ME : Andromeda. Also started playing Mirror's edge Catalyst. Gameplay is good, plot doesn't seem that coherent. If anybody here is on Xbone, please do yourself a favor and get EA Access, so many good games and the list keeps increasing, Just finished Ori and The Blind Forest on  Xbox One.. deciding on what to play next I bought all the story DLC for Batman: Arkham Knight and played through the new Season of Infamy missions, fun enough and true to the lore in many ways. The Harley Quinn and Catwoman DLCs, very interesting to play Harley, someone who will happily kill.

I never played Gears of War and I just got it on Xbox backwards compatibility, halfway through GoW2 now, this plus the next two games in the series should keep me occupied until Mass Effect: Andromeda comes out. Completed the final episode of Hitman 2016. It's a genuinely great game, but I cannot recommend it to people who have slow internet connections. **Mount and Blade** - Medieval sandbox rpg, sort of comparable to skyrim although completely different in terms of gameplay and on combining it with good and **huge** number of mods, it becomes a masterpiece.

**Vampires the Masquerade: Bloodlines** - also an rpg, timeless classic, if you can manage to ignore the graphics it can easily become your all time favourites. Be sure to use fanmade mods that fixes the buggy gameplay. [deleted] Highly recommended series of games by Rusty Lake on Android. 

Anyone have recommendations for creepy/horror games for smartphones?  Finished gta 5 main missions I've been playing some **Dota 2** and getting back into the **Guild Wars 2** routine. Guild Wars 2 is an amazing MMO, with great and constant developer interaction with the community, and lots of endgame content. Just infinite replay value, compared to most MMOs.
Haven't run into any Indian players on it though. Kind of a weird question, but I'm in Hyderabad and I'm told Shwetha computers at CTC is the place to go buy computer parts. 

Do they have EMI option for components? I just need a graphic card.  Started dabbling with Space Engine yesterday. It's so breathtakingly beautiful and mind boggling huge. For people who don't know Space Engine is a free universe simulator which is developed by a single person.  Playing MGS V and FEAR rn, also shameless plug of /r/IndianGaming    
 I've recently completed the campaign missions in Battlefield Bad company 2. Any similar recommendations? 

My Windows 10 laptop is running on 8 gigs of RAM, intel hd graphics 4400 and 1TB hard disk. Circus Charlie   
Super Mario   
Contra    
Lunar Ball    
&nbsp; 

Emulator set on my linux machine :)
 Recently finished Taiwanese game Detention. Awesome 2D side scrolling horror game. Where can I get a nice deal on used games and ps4? (Apart from OLX, prefer online with credit card payment)

 Tried rimworld. Too complicated for me sadly.  Downloaded open emu for mac, playing classics DBZ, mortal kombat, God of war, etc for now! :) All I have to say is, I'm looking forward to ME:Andromeda and Danganronpa v3 (Spike Chunsoft PLEASE give us a steam release this year).

Anything else I should be interested in this year? FIFA 17 on my new Xbox One since a month. Playing very regularly and getting pretty good at it, not that I hadn't played FIFA earlier. Ultimate Team this year is pretty fun and got a few new modes. Also Rocket League sometimes in between as a nice light game. Started playing few GBA games on my One Plus 3 using an emulator. A must for people who haven't played Nintendo games in their childhood. 

Emulator app: My Boy (Android)
Games:
Super Mario Bros Advance 4
Sonic Advance
Pokémon emerald FIFA 17. Ultimate Team is fucking addictive. Anyone addicted to ark? Anyone here on Battlefield 1 - PS4? I really want to form a squad. Please reply you!! I will send you a request.  **Don't Starve** a survival game with amazing art style and its uncompromising and challenging design. Addicted to GTA Online (PS4). Thought my MMO days were over in high school but this one is such a treat to play, incredible gameplay and the most detailed map I've ever seen in a game.

Didn't carry my xbox, so nights were getting quite lazy with me watching old south park episodes and other random stuff.

Two days back I discovered that there is a small game arcade a small walk away from my hotel. Never had so much fun in a long time with total strangers playing a Chinese version of Donkey Kong. Playing half life 2. Will buy new pc after boards B| and play all those amazing games i missed for the last 2 years and the new games like Nier Automata!  \^o^
Hopefully a dope ryzen setup. [INSIDE](http://store.steampowered.com/app/304430/agecheck) Hey, Dev of **Memories On The Meter** here. The game is up for voting on **Steam Greenlight** (you can vote here - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=877702026 ). 

The game is a story based game which is played in the first person. You are an unnamed protagonist who is travelling on a taxi after a rough night. As you pass by landmarks of the city, memories associated with the place take place in flashbacks, shaping what happens next. 

You can check out the Trailer, screenshots as well as other details on the [Greenlight Page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=877702026). If you like this and want to see this game on Steam, kindly vote and share with your friends if possible - it helps a lot if the game gets Greenlit. [deleted] Getting brutally owned by the opponents in /r/outside   gonna camp for a while Looking for people to play overwatch as a team in mumbai **Horizon Zero Dawn** is looking really good. I'm trying to convince my friend who has a PS4 to get it so I can play it :P

I'm gonna be doing a gta marathon. Completed **GTA III** yesterday. The controls feel really weird 16 years later.

Also has anyone played **Victoria II**? Seems like the best of the current crop of Paradox games. Thinking of buying it. Got myself a copy of Overwatch. Really liked it, but still playing Paladins more. Anyone tried playing Arkham Knight? Was it even released?  Anyone can help me with some games for mac ? I have a MacBook prob 2015 15 inch. 

Also let me know if i install windows these games will run smoothly ? Playing **Assassin's Creed Series** and completing the entire series this year thanks to Jio.Will not be playing for next two weeks due to well... my boards.It's a great series BTW.

P.s. Anybody play AC 4 please put down your uplay to increase my ship speed in Kenway's Fleet.

I am also looking forward to RDR 2, Injustice 2 whether they come to PC or not.But they will (should) hopefully :) Sticky please  Got a new laptop with a low-range graphics card (GTX940M). It can play Far Cry 4 at low-mid settings comfortably.

Been out of gaming for a long, long time. Please suggest some games.

Nothing new AAA of course - won't run on my computer. 

Prefer games that don't have too much story and focus more on action. 

Any ideas? Finished Quantum Break on one sitting this Saturday. Very cool plot, they had 2 hours worth of live-action episodes in between the in-game 'acts'. Only gripe was poor performance.  Have been immersed in a few indie games of late. [Astroneer](http://store.steampowered.com/app/361420/) and [Empyrion] (http://store.steampowered.com/app/383120/) are two games that really stood out. Empyrion has really great crafting mechanics IMO (wish No Man's Sky had such attention to detail).

Also got around to playing Mafia 3 that had been sitting in my Steam library for quite a while now. Unfortunately, the gameplay is often a drag. Love the story and the voice acting though. Getting super hyped for the PC release of **Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3** that drops tomorrow! It's Mahvel baybee!  Horizon: Zero Dawn. It looks gorgeous and it's fun to play.  Playing solo Rust on EU 1 :( Currently playing **Dishonored 1**. Can someone recommend similar **single-player** games that have similar hardware requirements? Anyone in videsh now and returning in a few days/weeks ? I want to buy an original XBox 360 controller for PC. Flipkart shows out of stock. Amazon.com has high customs Why doesn't Nintendo lunch their consoles in India? Playing lots of Invisible Inc. It is so good at organically producing high-stakes heist movie moments! I am totally hooked. I just finished the beginner campaign last week, and now I'm making my way through the experienced one. The difficulty curve is really well done. I can easily see myself putting hundreds of hours into this game. I haven't even got the dlc yet! Project CARS, Civilisation 5, Left for Dead 2..

anything but Counter Strike... PM me.

 Nice thread, can we add book reccos to this thread. It would be nice to know who is reading what. I'm sure many of you are familiar with Bastille, who came out with the super hit Pompeii. They've released a new song earlier this year called **'Send them off'** but it hasn't reached anywhere close to the popularity of Pompeii. It became pretty famous thanks to FIFA 17 and it is really unique and the lyrics are based off Shakespeare's Othello! Must give it a listen :

Scheduled,Either India's property developers are insane or I am.,198,d4jscs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4jscs/either_indias_property_developers_are_insane_or_i/,155,"I'm at the age where buying a house is the next thing on my agenda. I've been looking at listings on property websites a lot lately. So consequently, most of the ads I see online on Instagram, Facebook and even Reddit are for properties.

Nothing about these properties or their pricing makes any sense to me whatsoever.

Take a new development by Godrej in Delhi - Godrej South Estates. They've been spamming the shit out of me with their ads. The prices start at ""only"" 2.6cr for. 2 bedroom. For a 4 bedroom apartment, rates start at 6.5-7cr.

They're pushing it as some sort of ultra luxury destination...except its in Okhla, which is an industrial area. I used to have my office in the area and its literally one of the shittiest areas in the entire city. There is a literal trash mountain right next to the development

Not that development has even started yet. They're advertising $1M apartments built near trash heaps witg delivery scheduled around Modi's next term.

The situation in Gurgaon seems to be even more insane. There are apartment complexes built in the middle of nowhere with not a single street light for miles being advertised for crores.

Meanwhile if you wanted an apartment in the already established, well settled areas in DLF Phase 3, you can get them for half the price

Back in my hometown of Jaipur, apartments rates are equally out of whack. You can pay 1cr for an apartment in Vaishali Nagar...or you can buy a piece of land 100 meters away from the apartment and built a little mansion of your own for less than 1cr

My brain is not really able to compute any of this. 5cr apartments that are not even 50% ready built in the middle of nowhere? Who is buying them? More importantly, why are they buying them?

At this point, I feel that I will keep renting all my life. Not because I can't afford a house, but because nothing about the Indian property market seems rational to me. I make very substantial money but I refuse to participate in this utter irrationality


Can't wait to hear how millennials killed the realty sector",mrfreeze2000," Try Faridabad, Noida or Ghaziabad. Delhi, due it development commands a hell lot of price in the property market. Gurgaon was once for those who couldn't afford a home in South Delhi. Thanks to corporate invasion, Gurgaon too has become expensive even after having terrible infra. Meanwhile, in Noida Extension, you'll find guys jumping in the middle of the road trying to sell a 3bhk for 30 lacs ( that too is negotiable). At the end of the day, all boils down to demand supply and development. Truth is, nobody is buying. Larger Builders are forced to launch to cover costs of old projects, continuously be able to make debt payments, while raising more debt, monetize existing land inventory and most importantly to keep up appearances. My suggestion is to look for builders who have less than 10 projects and are heavily focused on per project profitability and not company wide profitability or best buy plot and build. DM if you have questions. It doesn't make any sense, you are being charged premium for an apartment which is not yet built and will also depreciate with time, not to forget it's at a location which MAYBE developed in the next few years.
There is definitely a real estate bubble, we just don't know how it will pop. I've worked in this sector and have followed the demand and supply trend and I would urge you to reconsider your decision to buy an apartment.

Reason 1: a land surplus area such as NCR will always have new apartments coming up and your old apartments will never see a decent ROI. 

Reason 2: Delhi has over 5 years worth of supply to clear out before demand picks up again. No one is buying these expensive concrete slabs in sky. Why should you? 

If you just want to park your money for long term then buy semi liquid govt bonds. If you're worried about inflation eating away your investments then buy gold.

If you're still hell bent on investing in real estate then buy land. Apparently we've stopped making land. (͡•_ ͡• ) >Who is buying them? More importantly, why are they buying them?

NRIs of Randia are buying them for investment. Read somewhere that people are buying second-hand homes directly from owners instead of from builders because of this. Its all speculation. They are building flat with the target in mind that 20LPA guy invest all of his live in their flat. But ignore the other fact of life. Its utterly foolish to invest in a flat which will degrade over time at that high cost.

You are right soon they will cry millennial but no one ask them about unreasonable price. Its is same like doing Challan of 25K for15k bike. Go to hell. I always have wondered how realty companies are always keeping the price high even when economy is not really well or supply is very high. There is no real supply-demand pricing in the industry at all. I wouldn’t doubt for a minute that there is collusion between the developers and they keep the price high.

Also, the money is paid upfront for many developments and they are not the ones losing money if it’s delayed due to not all apartments getting sold. Real estate is the black hole in which all the wealth, clean and ill gotten alike, flow. 

Nothing ever makes sense in real estate.

New money is created after existing assets and this leads to asset price inflation.

The only way to control this is to have a property price linked progressive rates/fees pegged at 0.5-2% to fund local governments. For second property, increase it to double unless rented out on long term lets. This would make it unattractive to invest unless you want to live there.

This would remove housing from the list of investment/speculative instruments and finance local authorities to find basic things like trash collection and footpaths. Property rates will fall as well and hurt a lot of people. You must also understand the dynamics of constructing a building. Firstly, the primary determinant of price is the value of the land. Then you need govt permits and passing. You need to get sewage lines and roads. For all of this, you must grease the wheels. Also, often times, the landowners charge extremely high prices for the land itself as it’s a psychological factor among Indians regarding real estate. It causes the prices to sky rocket while old farmland owners now ride around in Mercs and bmws. In order to distribute cost, builders are left with one of two choices, either build more apartments and smaller sizes, but govt doesn’t give permission over a certain height, or they can build big apartments and price it at luxury. Not saying builders are victims here, there is sufficient addition of their margins as well. 

I come from a builder family and have been involved in this all my life. These are my 2 cents on the topic. I recently also saw a video that I will share below. It’s not on this topic but it will help get a little more clarity on the subject. 


https://youtu.be/sgEq0HSsAQc ""They're advertising $1M apartments built near trash heaps witg delivery scheduled around Modi's next term.""

Wait. What do you mean, ""Next Term""? Building Construction Money distribution 

Local netas need it 

Local sp need it 

Local municipal corporation needs it 

Plus add mafia too sand/ cement etc 

Builders are not going to give them money out of their own pocket 

Hence this high price Boss if you think this is insane, try Mumbai, I am totally at a loss to understand how normal folk can afford to buy an apartment in Mumbai.
I gave up waiting for the bubble to burst a good five years ago..
I keep hearing rumours about the supposed real estate crash, but it hasn’t happened and don’t think it will.. This is all well and good but why haven't you installed an ad-blocker my friend?

>So consequently, most of the ads I see online on Instagram, Facebook and even Reddit are for properties. I think it's same in all other states, I am from Ajmer, Rajasthan project is not yet started and prices of these flats starts from 2-3 crores... And this just only..🙄 Come to Hyderabad... Millennials killed the sector by not having 7 crores to buy these places, nor being stupid enough to take out a 7 cr loan which they'll pay off for the rest of their life. 

Stupid stupid millennials. Why don't you buy a parcel of land and build your own mansion? It's better than living under the whims and fancies of pesky associations who will dictate their oft irrational terms.

Plus you can hire an architect to design the building exactly to your specifications. Most will even be willing to work within your budgetary constraints.

I only mention this because you said you can afford a house. Imo if you are looking for something permanent t3-t4 cities are the choice.

Way healer living cost.


However I know people  live somewhere while they work. Idk how though.

You pay rent for decades you lose a lot of money.

Loan+ emi system is no good again cause you the prices are too high. My dad bought land a couple of years ago that was double registered and had to take a loss. Another one was encroached (but that was like 20 years ago). If I was buying it as an investment or remotely, an apartment is way lower risk. Of course, location is the most important criteria and those apartments sound like an terrible idea on that basis. Probably don't go for brand builders. I'm considering one here in Bangalore that is being sold at 5900/sqft. It's at a great location and the flat has been coming along well. Only thing is it's not a brand everyone knows. 

I did the math and the rent yield on this flat is similar to what my relatives have in Australia (iirc around 20 odd years to pay off your buy price at the current rental value). Indian property developers are idiots tbh, I can conclude that after working with them for sometime. 

Don't buy a house now, at least for next 4-5 years there won't be any reasonable price increase. Primary reason being there's already too much unsold inventory. Buy only distress sale properties. 

To answer your godrej example the reason they're charging premium cause they have the quality and finance to complete the project, which hardly any developer has.

Lot of investors buy at extremely low prices before launch and later sell at market prices whoever is ready to buy or they just hold them to park their money.

Prices won't come down no matter how much people want they just won't increase in the years to come .

Keep renting that's a better way, I took me some time but I've convinced my parents it makes no sense to buy a home vs renting


You can also read the interview of abhishek lodha ceo of lodha group on economic times 


Wait for next year to see problems with lodha like with jaypee


*Refinancing risk mounts at Lodha Dev* 

1. India Ratings downgraded Lodha’s debt to BBB-, citing large FY20/F21e debt maturities, poor operational performance, and weak 
refinancing environment.

2. Of the total gross debt of ~Rs256bn, ~66% is domestic; ~55% of domestic debt is with NBFCs. Total debt maturing in FY20e and FY21e is ~Rs60bn, and ~Rs94bn, respectively.

3.  Refinancing seems inevitable, as internal accruals are unlikely to be sufficient, given the current slow pace of residential sales (which plummeted 17% in FY19).

4. The major assets backing the refinancing of debt are the unencumbered Palava landbank of ~3,300 acres (valued at ~Rs330bn) and unsold inventory of ~Rs329bn

5. Bulk of the sales, going forward, is likely to accrue from six key MMR projects, so the  company may have to reduce prices to address falling sales. As Mumbai's biggest developer, any price action by Lodha is also likely to impact market pricing. Honestly  many uninformed NRI keep buying these as  ""investments"" but adjusted for inflation and apartment does not appreciate at all . 


 It's better to rent these apartments and buy a small plot of land with your money . Just make sure all documents are in order and don't buy in a boom they lobby together for the prices.

once the rate has been set you can do nothing. no law is useful. if the builder says i am pricing x amount then you have to pay the x amount.  they can bring RERA and all other things. but nothing is going to change. 

reason is the economic divide and population > houses available. also there is lot of political backing.

once a builder for *reconstruction* told me that people who will those 3-4 cr for the house want to leave with standard people. those who have been leaving in the building are not of the standard and hence must leave.

so basically he was reconstructing on their plot/ building and making profit on their land. but wanted them to leave because they were not standard people.

the society is also equally responsible for this shit. This is horryfying to say the least.Soon people might have to living like hostel life for the rest of their life. Agree Gurugram is very expensive Same situation here , my dad is retiring soon and we are looking for a new villa in Ahmedabad. Most of the independent houses starts from 3-4 cr. It's not like we cannot afford it , they are totally 100% not worth the price. Asking 3cr for 2500 square feet house which is outskirts of the city is insane Similar shit in Pune. Everywhere you see hoarding for flats, but I feel these are way overpriced. 

A small 2 BHK cost 70lakh + in Punawala DLF Phase 3 is NOT a good place to move to. It’s overbuilt and among the worst maintained areas of  Gurgaon among other things. I’ve spent 25 years here and  looking forward to moving out next year. Exactly the same shit in Pune. I was lucky enough to get a small bit of land early on and built my own *little mansion*. 

My friends find themselves in this situation now and they are explaining me the same shit. It is ridiculous that a property developer who has just bought land and finished planning the structure has somehow managed to assess property value at the time of sale (X years later, 5 or more), rate of ameneties and this one was an absolute shocker for me; cost for parking space: in lakhs! (WTF!) 

>	At this point, I feel that I will keep renting all my life.

If you like a particular place you’re renting, it’ll be far easier to negotiate a long rental term with the owner than negotiating a price with these real estate people. 

While doing so, you can create a fund reserve and buy a decent chunk of land to build a proper house. 

>	I'm at the age where buying a house is the next thing on my agenda.

Perhaps if you can defer this for a later date, you can invest in other stuff right now and later use this invested money to invest in real-estate. > Not because I can't afford a house, but because nothing about the Indian property market seems rational to me

Indian real estate market was a 3 way ponzi scheme till RERA came in.  Prices won't go down because it makes all 3 parties unhappy. Its a mexican standoff, they are all holding guns to each others head. Everybody loses if prices go down. Best case prices go sideways for 10 years and effectively get cheaper after adjusting for inflation.

Builders would sell all their flats at pre launch for a discount, get paid upfront and use that to launch a new project and repeat the exercise. Banks were happy to lend ever increasing amounts to such customers since home loans have low default rates and it builds their loan book. Buyer would make 20% down payment, builder is 'taking care of EMI' till possession anyways. Even if they sell it for 20% appreciation in 3 years. Its 100% profit since they only paid 20% to begin with.

Obviously big assumption is that you will find a buyer in 2-3 years for your property. As long as that keeps happening everyone is happy.

Problem was specially bad in NCR market. If you make a list of flat owners of most of the stuck NCR projects, you'll find quite an overlap, same usual suspects owning flats in multiple projects now struggling to pay their EMIs. When it comes to Purchasing property I have a boomer mindset, will never buy a house in a city, rent it all the way. At worst rather will buy a farmland in my hometown with that sort of money. >5cr apartments that are not even 50% ready built in the middle of nowhere? Who is buying them? 

It is estimated that most of the black money is is real estate . There is your answer. I have already invested in a flat in bangalore just 5 years back thinking that this is what i ""should"" invest in my lifetime for sure. I hastily bought one in a slightly center part of the city which was in my budget but by a sub par builder. I have regretted it few months after moving in for various of reasons. 

I strongly believe there are other great movable investing options than real estate which has faster and easier liquidating process. I would have not bought the flat had I had this knowledge. They keep putting out non affordable products that nobody wants and complain when nobody buys. Kinda like automobile.

Honda city has more than doubled in price over 10 years while remaining pretty much the same car. ""how to make very substantial money"" ? please suggest ಠ_ಠ.. (serious reply only)",2019-09-15 20:26:18
Scheduled,Most effective way to deal with Indian clients.,19,es75b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es75b5/most_effective_way_to_deal_with_indian_clients/,11,"Hi there.

I was hoping to trouble you for advice about how to deal Indian clients.

I'm a Sri Lankan criminal lawyer practicing in Canada.  My office is in an area with a large number of immigrants from South East Asia.

I don't want to generalize, but I've had some issues with Indian and Pakistani clients.  For one, despite being in an area with many Indian and Pakistani client, I've only retained very few Indian and Pakistani clients.

Despite only being retained by very few Indian clients,  I get a lot of calls and even visits from Indian individuals.  These people often try and take up as much time as possible and ask loads of questions but will refuse to sign up or pay for anything.  Because they're a large community in my area, they actually interfere with my practice by taking and energy time away from paying customers.   After many such visits, I've began to realize that they were only after free advice and not interested in buying anything.

Of course people of other races call for free advice from time to time as well.  But they are in 99% of cases honest about it, and polite about not taking up too much of my time.  Unfortunately the opposite is true for nearly 90% of Indian callers.

Also, I noticed that the few Indian customers I do get are demanding and not very good at keeping up with payment.

Of course this hasn't been the case with all Indian clients, some have been absolutely stellar.  However, it has been the case with way too many of them to the point where I realized I need a better strategy to deal with  it.  Of course, this only seems to apply to people who have immigrated from India or Pakistan relatively recently or people who haven't really integrated well to Canadian culture.  Indians who have integrated to Canadian culture are a joy to work with.  And because at least one person is bound to say it - yes I understand generalizations, not all Indians etc etc.

I realize this sounds like a rant  but it's not.  The reason I'm here is because I realized that there must be some of you who run service oriented businesses in India.   If I'm getting a disproportionate amount of this behavior from Indian clients, Indian businesses must get it alot from their clients.  My question is how do you deal with it?  How do you run an effective business under these conditions?

Do businesses in India have a method for spotting and  weeding out individuals who are looking for free advice and just wasting your time?   Do businesses in india have a strategy for dealing with difficult or demanding clients.   What strategies to Indian businesses employ to make sure payment schedule are met on time.   And finally, I'm starting to suspect that the main way to get Indian clients is through referrals through someone they know, is this suspicion accurate or is there another way to market effectively to Indian clients.

Basically what's the best way for a business owner to serve Indian clients without losing his mind?",vivek_david_law," Do you tell clearly that x minutes are free and you have to pay beyond that? 

Setup a clock in front of client if they visit in person. just hang the board outside ""aaj nagad, kal Udhaar"" I understand your plight.

We have the same problem here in India.

If you get any solution then share it with us too. Have two doors in your office. One marked - Professional Chargeable Services  and the other "" Free consultations""

If they open the the second door, they find themselves in the bathroom. We, Indian are always looking to get as much as possible things and services with little or no payment of money.

There are also those God send clients, that pay good and pays on time.

I just inform my rates and cut service for the non good one's. Put a increased rate and reduce few percent saying that the offer is only for them. This helps in reducing the non-performance works and getting good clients.

Even if I am free or very less work, it's good than doing a work in loss.",2020-01-22 12:58:24

A Bribery Case

>Transcripts of purported conversations between the three accused persons – retired Odisha high Court Judge I.M. Qudussi, middleman Vishwanath Agarwala and B.P. Yadav of the Prasad Education Trust – in the medical college bribery scam reveals that college officials had, in fact, planned to bribe senior functionaries of the Supreme Court and the Allahabad High Court in return for a favourable judgement, reports The Wire.

**CJI Mishra was one of the judge who gave the judgement \[mentioned above\].**

&#x200B;

There was lot of tussle among top judges.

**Dipak Mishra, in his entire tenure, gave cases without following SC tradition; which later led to a major event in the history of India.**

Then there's Ranjan Gogoi: I wrote elaborately about him:  [Justice Ranjan Gogoi: The Worst Chief Justice of India (I've ever seen)](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/exexa4/justice_ranjan_gogoi_the_worst_chief_justice_of/)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

I'm not directly blaming BJP over this \[contrary to the title\].

But let's take a look:

1. Jagdish Singh Khehar's case related to the death of  K Pul.
2. Dipak Mishra: K Pul case &  Bribery case.
3. Ranjan Gogoi : Sexual harassment case.

In all 3 cases, BJP Govt came heavily in support of these judges.

Did it make these judges to incline towards BJP?

Had there been proper protocols to deal with such incidents, which upholds the integrity of SC, wouldn't it be better?

Scheduled,My recent experience with a NEXA dealership.,39,eihedp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eihedp/my_recent_experience_with_a_nexa_dealership/,16,"TLDR: Don’t take the word of a car dealership/service station at its face value. Do your due diligence, ask around  before committing to any off the schedule repair/maintenance. 

So about 3 weeks back, I borrowed a near new condition Ignis (about 2.5 year old and less than 15k kms) from a cousin and drove to about 130kms to a town nearby for some urgent family matter. 

15 mins into the drive, the steering felt a bit strange and I stopped over to check. Upon inspection of the tires and the engine bay, everything seemed ok. But thought I’d get the wheels balanced and aligned once I reach my destination. So I refilled the tires with correct air pressure (which was off a bit) and went on my way.

Drive to the destination was fine and mostly highway driving. Upon reaching my destination I noticed that the car’s front tire assembly would make a funny sound on sharp turnings, as I was parking it. Opened up the hood and saw a lot of grease/oil smeared near the passenger cv shaft ( the rod that connects the engine to the tire and drives it). I immediately knew that the CV boot ( rubber cover around a bearing) had busted and had spilled all its grease. 

But just to be sure and since this was not my car, I took it straight to the Nexa showroom, while I also calling the owner of the car. The Nexa showroom people pointed me to the their service station, which thankfully wasn’t that far. Nobody at the showroom bothered to come see the car and see if it was even drivable (or safe to drive). But I can understand since this was just a sales showroom.

Upon reaching the service centre the foreman inspects the car and says that the whole cv shaft is broken and would need a replacement. I asked if he was 100% sure and asked to see the owner for confirmation. The owner repeats the same and they quote me Rs 7000 (plus labour) for the fix and ask me to leave the car there for a few days as they would need to order the part. I asked them to provide me with a inspection/quotation paper. Which they did. I then tell them that according to my experience and knowledge only the cv boot needs replacement. They totally dismissed my input. By this time I had already removed the car from their service station and parked it outside. 

I then call my cousin and explain the whole situation in front of the service station owner and the foreman. I tell him what the Nexa service people think was the problem and the price and time associated with the fix. He then asks me what my opinion was, and I tell him that that the CV shaft in my opinion was ok and only the boot/rubber cover needs replacement and refilling with grease. Since the wheel still had power and the CV shaft was intact in one piece, and the reason for the sound was no/low grease around the cv bearing. I tell him that I knew that the CV shaft was fine and only the boot/rubber covering was broken since about 4 years ago I had personally replaced the whole CV shaft on my own car (common issue on older cars) and know about these issues.

After hearing this, the owner leaves and the foreman asks me to sign the quotation/service form which now states that they couldn’t repair the car because of “unavailability of part”. 

After that, I go to a car repair market nearby and consult with the mechanic there. Who confirms my diagnosis. And after confirming with my cousins, he fixes it within 1.5 hours for a total of Rs 700. The car drives fine, no problems since. 

Knowing that this was not my car, I would have happily paid more that Rs 700 if Nexa service people were willing to replace the cv boot. Maybe just maybe they don’t replace the cv boot, period. But at least they could have been honest with me and not miss diagnosed the issue. I never trusted car dealerships and their service stations, this just added to the list.",seeyoulateraligator," FWIW all service centres are like this. Unless you really make a stand and fight it out, they'll insist on replacing the entire part instead of a minor part or even fixing the problem. Shouldn't insurance be covering these cases? I would like the insurance company to fight with the service center over the diagnosis since I simply lack the know-how. Good on you for being knowledgeable though. Useless upselling is becoming very common in India. The cost of useless add ons (like break cleaning, AC Vent cleaning and what not) is almost half of the necessary stuff during the routine service.

Maruti is the worse of the lot as they have so many people who are customers, because even after a decline in market share in the recent past, just about every other car sold in India is a Maruti, and they want to be able to fleece every last one of them.

The thing which I find the most annoying with Maruti however is, even after all the upselling, they place a windscreen cleaner sachet and a car perfume and charge the customer for it, even when nobody ever asks for it. Welcome to the unregulated capitalistic market. God man. I thought I just needed to learn driving to own a car. But then reading this  made me rethink. 
Do every car owners know this kind of stuff or you the exception mate?",2020-01-01 19:23:28

Scheduled,Qnet...Dnt tell I didn't tell you,123,dhn5is,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dhn5is/qnetdnt_tell_i_didnt_tell_you/,43,"Some of us might have heard of Qnet and for those who haven't this thread is for you guys

This actually happened like a year ago and I had totally forgotten about it till someone pitched me Qnet again a few days ago.

Back in 2018, I had quit my cushy job and just about started my own startup - so money was tight, I was highly motivated and looking to jump at any opportunity and this is when a guy I used to work with messaged me and told me he had this insane opportunity for me. He said it was a limited-time opportunity and he was recommending me to his mentors - this is where I started feeling like this is an MLM pitch or some sort of scam but given that I had always known him to be an honest fellow I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

He scheduled a meet with some senior and this was in Sheraton, Delhi. So, first I meet this lady who says she's been working with this eCommerce/ networking company for past 2-3 years and here is the gist of the talk I had with her

1. She earns lakhs by working only a few weeks of the month, travels the world when she fancies, blah blah stuff like that.
2. I heard more irrelevant business jargons in 45 mins from her than I did in my 2 years of b-school.
3. Tried to discuss on a few of the business jargons she had been throwing around and I realised she only knows the terms and not what they mean.
4. So in 45 mins, I hear everything from her own success story to random stuff, but not a single word of what the opportunity is about or what the revenue model is - only that the more hours I put in, the more money I make and the returns are like 500%.
5. She says she liked my personality, motivation and whatnot and would let me know if I qualified for the program. Then she goes on for 10-15 minutes to say how CEOs, VPs, etc. are lining up for this opportunity and even shows me her contact list saying all these people have been after her life so that she lets me in on this once in a lifetime opportunity. By now I had figured out this was some good scam and cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro. Shes like she will recommend me but chances are 50-50.
6. Guess what? 10 minutes later, a very senior person in the business happens to be coming to this very hotel and that she can arrange for me to meet with him now only and all I had to do was impress him.

Part 2: Meeting the so-called bigshot

1. So I had earlier talked about my love for travelling and building my own business in marketing. So, the guy tells me that he has travelled over 50 countries last year and the lakhs of rupees he makes from this business helped him to secure his own passion project.
2. Apparently he was earning 5 lakhs per month in the IT industry before quitting his job. But despite me repeatedly asking he did not tell me which company he used to work for or even what role he was working in.
3. By now, I am just enjoying my snacks and trying to see how far these scammers will go to sell me whatever it is they are trying to sell.
4. The guy also realised his sales pitch was not working and so he tried to convince me that I was morally responsible for my parents having to work in their old age when I should be able to provide for them and this opportunity was the only way I was going to do that
5. I repeatedly asked him what organization I would be working for and he evaded the question every single time. The only thing he said was that **Microsoft** handles their paperwork and hence, they are a trustworthy company.
6. At the very end, he casually mentions that fees for xyz stuff are **INR 1,70,000** and that I would be making that back in the next few weeks only.

Thanked him, finished my snacks and said I would think about it. I very nearly wanted to go full ballistic and let him know what a load of bs he had been going on about.

Also, they did ask for my PAN CARD photo which I said I didn't have on me and said I will send it once I get back, which I never did.

As for the guy who got me into this entire waste of time, I see him post motivational posts on social media daily, post pics of trips to exotic places and him riding inexpensive cars. He did try to pressure me into paying up the money and all he said was that the company name was QNET and nothing about what they did. A quick google search was enough to verify my doubts.

Hope this story helps someone out there",masoomdon," Such shit keeps coming back with different names. There was ebiz, they were booked for fraud. Now it's QNET. We need to keep people aware of this. Thanks for sharing. I had an old colleague who was trying to convince me to join some mlm group.

He actually showed me pics from Malaysia and some other country. So these guys sponsor foreign trips ? r/antimlm would love this. > cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro.

Lel Beware. The same guys are now roaming on the LinkedIn and sending unsolicited Connect request with a followup message on the upcoming excellent business proposition. [deleted] >first I meet this lady

Was the lady good-looking? I experienced pretty much the same story; but a downgraded version in 2013. The meeting happened in a CCD outlet in Bandra. I wasn't even offered a coffee. Got caught into this by my ex-boss. 

The best reason that the female recruiter gave me was that she woke up at 5.30AM that day because she WANTED to see the sun rise. I was the schmuck, according to her, who got up early because he had to reach office on time. If only I would join her ponzi scheme, even I could enjoy such financial independence, she implied.  

Told her that I needed to be in office early the next day and left quickly. > cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro

but you got free snacks! My best friend joined some mlm back in 2004. It was just 3000 payment and same old 2 members story. I told him take my 3000 and make me member if you really need to make member because you are my best friend but i will not make any new members. Being a best friend he denied my offer. Soon he realized its not worth. I just plainly say I don't have money or time😂 A friend of mine approached me with the same scheme. I too had to go through what you had too, just said their company is ocean, which indeed is a part of qnet. About 4-5 years ago in Bangalore, a randommer approached my flatmate and I...while we were shopping for groceries. Noped out of there and my flatmate was already aware of the scam. I went there to have an amazing buffet lunch. Enjoyed it. 😁 QNet is old scam. Qnet, EBiz are some local MLM scams. Herbalife is international which is also found in India. * I met a QNET guy a whole ago at CCD, asked him to pay for the coffee and the pizza and acted interested while eating it and after finishing it, asked him to get lost What do they do with the pan card ? Do they misuse it ? Qnet I believe is the same company which was running Goldquest, Questnet etc. back in 2000s.

These companies made me wary and skeptical of any of the old school or college mates or old colleagues who suddenly contact me out of the blue. Thankfully many just wanted to connect again. Dude, I pretty much experienced the same stuff from QNet, except for the claims that were made to you about income. So atleast they were a bit honest than the ones you met..
Also after couple of hours, I was eventually told what was the business.. 2 whole hours of sitting there and listening to the BS they kept on saying. The whole CCD was populated by this guys/gals only.. Btw I am talking about Bengaluru.

One of my camaraderie, did infact purchase the product of around 3 lacs. Dude still posts photos of his travels to mostly Thailand... Inspirational quotes. But believe me, that guy has multiple credit cards and maxed out most of them. Has taken several loans. He might be successful in the long run (1/100), but totally not worth for the effort that he puts in... a friend got into amway and tried hard to get me in. i even joined the program but only used for personal purchases so my account did not last for long. made a few thousand rupees. but of course spent more on buying products (for personal use). products were good but not worth the premium prices but it was ok. good fun experiment. 

eventually the friend became so pushy that i had to end up cutting him out of my personal life. not sure how well he is doing with his amway venture. he had a well paying job and i hope he is still continuing there. 

on related note... `on becoming a god in central florida` is a good show worth watching on mlm programs. it's not a documentary. probably satire. good watch. 

also... have seen notices at chaayos, ccds and other outlets mentioning how mlm sales pitches are not allowed on their premises. things must be crazy for them i guess. QNet is everywhere. My old college friend(now he's not) used to call me years after college just to say how are you and casually mention how amazing his business is doing. Guess what? His business is making other people give money to QNet. Fuck those people

I regret not outing this guy on the college whatsapp group What snacks did you get?",2019-10-14 15:24:46

I mean I did suck in fifa 16, but not at this level. my attackers just cannot escape the trailing defenders, and I always botch the final shot to the goal; I overshoot or meekly pass it to the goalie. so irritating. I finally won a game in Civ Beyond Earth, finally got the hang of how to win at it. It is way different than Civ 5 which I am used to.

Scheduled,February Goals >>>>>>>>,3,f2x27b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2x27b/february_goals/,4,"February Goals

It's been a little late for me to make resolutions for this year but we live in present and not past.

I think we all have the ability and audacity to think good and even exceptional things for ourselves. And I've learnt two things in life till now: whatever your goals are, let people know about it. It does two things: Firstly, people around you will help out and the secondly it will make you committed / liable.

So here it is:

Since I'm into public accounting and auditing, I've set a goal for myself to work with one of the big4 (**Deloitte, EY, PWC and KPMG**) in second half of 2020. 

For me it's a big deal to be a part of multinational and reputed accounting firms around the world. And I think it also serves a justice to my degrees as well.

So I've mapped out a plan which will help me in achievement of my goal. 

1. Everyday I would try to connect and speak with at least 1 recruiter and 3 people who are/were associate with those companies.
2. I will have my CV made from someone professional and experienced in this industry.
3. I will attend as many as networking events as possible and recite the same thing again to every person I come across in the hope of getting a connection somehow.
4. Try to schedule informational interviews if that's a thing in Dubai.
5. Make a professional video about my profile and upload it over social media.
6. Even I'll go one step further, upload all those networking and informational interviews videos on Youtube.
7. Maybe even run my Facebook and instagram ads against people who work in these organizations.
8. Last but not the least, prepare for that final day, EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY.

Now that would be it from my side and I'll leave out rest things on LUCK. 

Three things gonna happen from this post:

1. No-one responds (which is intact even worse) and I'll get on to my to-do list and check off every item listed above.
2. Someone who actually care about helping others and either work in these organisations or know someone there who can make things move would reach out to me.
3. And last one would be ones who will rant about everything.

Or just help me out on how to meet people and network with people over here in this part of the world? Coz I really want this thing man.",dxb23CA," Retarded goals to be honest.

Scheduled,[Scheduled]The population debate: The depopulation phase of India and it's impact of the economy,53,56bi87,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/56bi87/scheduledthe_population_debate_the_depopulation/,50,"Here's a question:
We know through stats that around 2050-60, the population the country will fall down, and with an estimated 2-digit trillion economy, we will see the rise of the GDP per capita.

This is all WITH the current TFR (It is at a replacement rate). Now we change some data shall we? The goverment decides that from tomorrow, would apply mandatory childless policies. It's illegal to procreate and people would need to adopt children if they want to be, you know, parents. Amazing! Orphans would get new homes and they are really happy (Let us assume, they law is perfectly enforced).

The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down. However, there's this problem: We have a lot old people, and the thing is *they can't work*. Especially a country like India, where there is huge population and on top of that: *a huge old population*. How are we going to give them pensions? Government would *spend* more than *gain* more? An old poor population isn't a very good incentive for FDI either. How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

Climate change is already making all problems worse, just look at farmers 300 million people were affected by Drought in last 2 years. farmers in India suffer from very high levels of malnutrition due to lack of awareness and low incomes.

Isn't it shocking that 700 million people in India still depend on Agriculture?

Yes Indian economy would grow but only top 20-30%( maybe 400 million people) of people are going gain hugely, the bottom 20% people will still suffer problems due to climate change. Either we make a decision now or forever be condemn to 3rd or 2nd world status. Simple answer is from 1.3 billion people, if Childfree policy is implemented today, India will still have billion people in couple of decades. Even if De-population occurs we will still have billion people.

If say India reaches 2.0 fertility rate in next five years and continuues trends, India will have 1.8 billion people by 2060.

So if Indians want to have any kind of decent life, de-population is the way. 1 billion people is better than 1.8 billion people.

So, what about dependency? **Problems of dependency are easy to solve than massive problems of India today or problems with 1.8 billion people.** Childfree is only thing going to save India from catastrophe of Water shortage, malnutrition, Quality education, natural resources stress, Urban problems, overcrowding. Climate change is already making all problems worse, just look at farmers 300 million people were affected by Drought in last 2 years. farmers in India suffer from very high levels of malnutrition due to lack of awareness and low incomes.

Either we make a decision now or forever be condemn to 3rd or 2nd world status. I am going to get downvoted to hell for saying this here but Childfree is not a solution. You don't stop eating food when you weight 200 kilos. You cut down the diet, learn how to do it, get discipline about it and implement it in your life. Agreed, in this case, you won't see any quick results in 6 months but educating Indians about the evils of many kids will go a long way. People need to understand, giving birth to a lot of kids is never the solution. However, if someone has the capacity to raise kids, I believe, they should have/adopt as many as they can handle. If you are an educated person and marry someone with a good background, you can raise a kid who will be an asset to the world instead of a liability. Think about that before you pushing Childfree on everyone. Yes, it will take down population drastically but a lot of people will lead an extremely unhappy, miserable life. That is just we'll have to live with. The transition phase from parents depending on 3-4 kids to care for them in their old age to parents saving for themselves or depending on 1 kid at max would be difficult but inevitable. Middle class older people do have savings to take them through retirement, but poorer classes will find this especially difficult. Depopulation policy? What are you going to do? Send the police to raid the bedrooms You have raised very valid questions. The kids on this forum do not understand this and will argue the toss with you for the next 20 years but, well, they are kids. I should know. I had the same views till a few years ago.  
  
Heck, these kids are more intelligent and more humane than I was. I was thinking up ways to mass murder millions of people.  
  
Now coming back to your questions: These are questions to which even the developed world is seeking answers. So far their only solution is mass immigration. Remember Germany's willingness to take in millions of asylum seekers/economic migrants? Solution to the same problem.  
  
A little known news item was the Portuguese asking the asylum seekers / migrants to come to Portugal.  
  
China relaxing the one-child policy? Another attempt at solving the same problem.  
  
I have a lot of Chinese friends and colleagues and talk to them all the time. All of them, without exception, are consumed by this same issue: how to take care of aging parents. The problem sir is jobs. The population isn't a number. It's people. How do you manage aspirations of millions of people who've going to struggle to get jobs in an increasingly hostile market? [removed] [deleted] [removed] You and the rest of the overpopulation crowd have an understanding of economics that is profoundly lacking. 

Per Capita GDP is not some hokey dokey ratio you can just tweak. Population and GDP and the nuances they contain are profoundly linked together. Those GDP growth forecasts are including the growth provided by a growing population.  [deleted] >The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down.

India doesn't have a huge old age population. Look the numbers [here](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2010.html#in)

We have almost 40% people in the most productive age group. We have 27% of our population which would be ready to be enter in workforce 10 years from now and upto 14 years after that even if we just stop to procreate anymore. I don't think managing India's old age population or providing for them would ever be a problem of India.

Scheduled,Are the students of Jamia Millia Islamia really interested in secularism? Evidence points to the contrary.,2,ee2yz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee2yz1/are_the_students_of_jamia_millia_islamia_really/,23,"Over the past week or so, we have seen violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across many states. The one that was probably reported the most was the protest by Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students. News channels like NDTV and India Today repeatedly reported how the police used excessive force against “peaceful” protesters. We were told that the students were opposed to the omission of Muslims from the CAA and sought to fight against it to “save” Indian democracy and “secularism”.

&#x200B;

While going through posts on social media, I came across an interesting piece of information - that JMI reserved 50% of its seats for Muslims. Not having too much faith in the accuracy of social media posts, I wanted to verify if this was really the case. Because if it were, it would clearly show that JMI was anything but secular. And so I started to go through their official websites: www.jmi.ac.in and www.jmicoe.in. What I learnt during my research astounded me. I knew that Muslim institutions gave preferential treatment to Muslims over non-Muslims but I never expected it to be this bad. My article relies solely on the documents and information available on these two official websites. No third parties, no hearsay. All the sources and links are listed at the end of this article.

  
To begin with, the claim that 50% seats in JMI are reserved for Muslims is absolutely true. The following text has been taken from Page 30 of the 2018-19 prospectus of JMI. (as can be seen in the attached image)

  
5.1  
(i) 30% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Muslim applicants.  
(ii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Women applicants who are Muslims.  
(iii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for “Other Backward Classes” (OBCs) and Scheduled Tribes who are Muslims.  
Note: If seats remain vacant in any program from amongst the 10% of the total number of seats earmarked as per 5.1 (ii) and (iii) above, such vacant seats shall stand transferred to the category 5.1(i),i.e., Muslim applicants.

  
In other words, 30% seats for Muslim applicants + 10% for Muslim women + 10% for Muslim OBC. If there are any vacant seats from the Muslim women or Muslim OBC category, then those seats would be transferred to other Muslim applicants. So there would AT LEAST 50% seats for Muslims in JMI. Why do I say at least 50%? Well, apart from the 50% reservation for Muslims, there’s 5% reservation for Persons with Disabilities (or PwD). This reservation for PwDs is not limited Muslims only but since the selection of students would be done by the JMI staff, they could opt for Muslims over PwDs from other religions. And on top of that, there’s 5% reservation for “Internal (Jamia) students” i.e. students of Jamia who have passed their qualifying examination (X or XII) from Jamia Schools. And given that the same 50% reservation policy for Muslims exists in Jamia schools, the students from this category could all be Muslims. So on the whole, there could be up to a maximum of 60% Muslims from the reserved categories.

  
But wait, it gets a lot worse!! There could be far more than 60% Muslims in a program / course. How? Because Muslims can also get admissions in the General category !!! In other words, 50% seats are reserved for Muslims only i.e. only Muslims can opt for these seats. Of the 5% reserved seats for PwDs, Muslims can be given preference. And 5% reservation for internal jamia students would almost certainly be all Muslims. On top of that, there would be Muslim applicants in the General category i.e. Muslims students who opt for admissions not via reservation but in the general category. So in the end, the percentage of Muslim students could be way more than 60%.

  
To find out the exact proportion of Muslim students, one would require the list of all admissions in a particular program / course. I did find the list of all admissions for the year 2019-20 but since those lists display only the registration number of the students and not their name and religion, it cannot be used to determine the exact number of Muslim students. However I did find the list of graduated students for the year 2018. This list mentions the name of the candidates in addition to the registration number. Here’s what I found:

  
a. In B.Tech Computer Engineering, 37 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 59%.  
b. In B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering, 40 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 64%.  
c. In B.Tech Mechanical Engineering, 43 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 66%.  
d. In B.Tech Civil Engineering, 51 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 78%.

  
Assuming that the proportion of students in admission and graduation would be more-or-less the same, this data not only confirmed my suspicions that the percentage of Muslim students in various courses would be least 60% but went on to show that it may be as high as 80%. I analysed the data for these four streams of engineering. There are several other courses but I did not spend my time analysing each and every single one. For those who are interested to dig deeper, relevant links can be found at the end of this article. 

  
I then looked into scholarships i.e. what percentage of the total number of students who received scholarships were Muslims. Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia (AAJMI) is tasked with providing scholarships for JMI students. I found the list of the selected candidates for the current year.

  
In the first list, out of the 325 selected candidates, 303 are Muslims; which is 93% !!  And in the second list, 96 out of the 99 candidates are Muslims i.e. 97%. In other words, of all the students who received scholarship in 2019, approximately 95% were Muslims.

  
This data conclusively proves that an overwhelming majority of students at JMI are Muslims and that Muslims are given preferential treatment. I wondered if the same pattern holds true for the positions of deans and Heads of Department (HODs). And predictably enough, JMI does not disappoint !!

  
Of the 37 heads of various departments, 32 are Muslim i.e. 86%. And when it comes to the Deans of faculties, 8 of the 9 are Muslim = 89% !! (Annual Report 2017-18)

  
Finally, I went through the list of Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors of JMI. By now, I’m sure you can guess what I would have found. Of the 11 Chancellors since 1920, not one is a non-Muslim. And the same holds true for VCs. Not one of the 15 Vice Chancellors since 1920 is a non-Muslim.

  
So in the end, *60-80% of the students, 95% of scholarship recipients, 86% of the HODs, approximately 90% of the Deans of faculties*, and all the past & present Chancellors & Vice Chancellors of JMI are Muslims !! And yet, they claim to fight for ""secularism"" !!!

  
Ask yourself these simple questions:  
1. How serious can the students of such a university be about “secularism”?  
2. Should we as a nation pay any heed to their demands given their shameless hypocrisy?  
3. If they indeed were such strong believers in the idea of secularism then wouldn’t they start by secularising their own university first?  
4. Do the students and professors of this university have a moral right to oppose ANY act on the grounds of secularism?

  
For any unbiased reader, this article conclusively proves that the JMI is not interested in secularism in the least. Then why are they protesting CAA? In my opinion, the reasons are:  
1. Supreme Court’s decision in favour of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.  
2. Belief that Muslims must be loyal to fellow Muslims over the country i.e. Muslim Ummah (or Ummat).  
3. Rightly / wrongly concluding that NRC will be bad.

  
It is also very interesting how leftists / liberals and Muslims have learnt the subtle art of appropriating the Constitution to suit their own agenda. Everybody has heard the accusation that the CAA violates Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. One can find many Muslims, and non-Muslims, repeating the same crap. It is however very interesting that Muslims are demanding equality and cite Article 14 as the justification. Well, if they are so bent upon equality, then why don’t they accept the demand for Universal Civil Code (UCC)? NO!! You see, when the debate is about UCC, they quote Article 25 of the Constitution which gives the right to practice one’s own religion and claim various special privileges as a religious right; for eg. four wives, triple talaq, etc. And when the discussion pertains to giving citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring Islamic countries, they jump to Article 14 !! In other words, they pick and choose that which suits them.

  
So the next time you meet a leftist/liberal or Muslim who says that they oppose CAA because it goes against Article 14 and the principle of equal treatment, ask him if he supports Universal Civil Code. If he denies or gives you a lengthy nonsensical answer as to why he opposes UCC, then he stands exposed ; proving that he / she is not really interested in secularism. 

  
It is amazing that channels like NDTV who claim to present facts as they are have never seen fit to inform Indians about the vastly disproportionate number of Muslim students in JMI. Nor do they call out the hypocrisy of JMI “students”. If they would have, the whole country would have learnt that these protests have nothing to do with “secularism”.

  
Now it is up to us to spread the word. Please share / forward this article so that the truth about JMI is known to everyone.

I really don’t see what you are trying to prove here. Muslims wouldn't need to ask for reservation if they were not treated like 2nd class citizens in their own country.

I'm sorry but your whole research is a waste of time.

Unlike us Hindus, muslim need to find places where their people live so that they are not discriminated at every facet of life.

My first flat that I rented in Mumbai, I was asked if I was a Muslim. I was lucky I wasn't. Why should I have felt lucky? 

Easy to preach the 'perfect' secularism and plurality when in majority, understand their pov first. Umm dude we have many institutions where there is reservation. 

Does it mean Jamia shouldn't protest or Jamia doesn't believe in secularism? Bro, minority institutions have always been empowered to fill majority of the vacancies with minorities. It is a right given to them since 1947.

BTW, would you call all our government institutions, banks, police stations, railways stations secular when they have photos of Hindu gods or temples inside their campus? That is the privilege of majority. I don't get it what the issue is? You've linked the prospectus but seem to have not read the part where it specifically says:

>It  symbolizes  the  unflinching  and  resolute  commitment  of  these  great  visionaries  in  bringing about  socio-economic  transformation  of  common  masses  in  general  and  ***Muslims  in  particular***  through  the vehicle  of  education.

You should begin by reading the history of it as well. Ironically, the reservation for muslim minorities is what makes it all secular.

No, it is merit based as per a merit list created for all applicants. This process is the same as any other university. So is the scholarship process. These processes are transparent everywhere, with verifiable records. There are rules for scholarships, whoever fulfils those rules, goes into a merit list, and the top n students are awarded the scholarship as defined in the guidelines.

Check this out:
[ISRO's Timeline from 1960s to Today](http://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/isros-timeline-1960s-to-today#81) **Post Launch Info:**

**IRNSS** is named **NAVIC** by Prime Minister Modi.


IRNSS-1G was injected into an elliptical orbit of 283 km X 20,718 km inclined at 17.867°. Solar panels of IRNSS-1G were deployed automatically. ISRO's Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan, Karnataka took over the control of the satellite.

In the coming days, four orbit manoeuvres will be conducted from MCF to position the satellite in the Geostationary Orbit at 129.5 deg East longitude. 


**NAVIC** acronym **NAV**igation with **I**ndian **C**onstellation


Navic means Ferryman or Sailor. Best of luck ISRO !

Finally a positioning system of our own which is free from foreign interference.

Edit: So the white knight liberal SJWs of Leddit are downvoting my comments because I expose their hypocrisy elsewhere. LOL . and they call themselves liberal, educated, tolerant etc. :) LIFT OFF! Another milestone in Self reliance  I read somewhere that India built the IRNSS constellation directly as a result of US denying GPS data to India during the Kargil conflict. Is this true? If so, can someone ELI5 how the US can deny GPS data? Was this general GPS signals or did India request for the precision signal that is reserved for US DoD use? Asking because I thought general GPS signals are broadcast and can be picked up by any receiver and the US cannot selectively deny reception to individual recievers?    Epic shit. Something that we all should be proud of.  Thanks for the stream mate! [Launch of PSLV-C33/IRNSS-1G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RF4rlzFSCs) Is IRNSS global? Or just India and it's neighboring region? So now we won't have to be dependent on GPS by US Air Force for navigating and can rely on more precise and accurate navigation by our own ISRO.

While discussing on +2 student Anita's death and NEET exam, the question of his daughter's admission came up. Apparently while his daughter refuses to divulge her marks over live call, he cooks up a random number in front of live cameras. Newschannel's upload [here] (https://youtu.be/mix22DL0qgw?t=33m5s) As expected, there's [more to it](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/decision-on-mbc-status-for-thevar-community-after-castebased-census/article2160131.ece) than meets the eye (link from a 2011 report). 

This particular community wants to be renamed **Most** Backward Class instead of their current status — Backward Class. Needless to say, it'll come with extra perks than existing ones. Plus, there's a whole lot of politics involved. In other words, this is pretty specific to TN. Maybe someone from TN can comment on this further. 

Swarajya, as expected, spun it to a whole new level and included a broader Hindu element to it.  Yes i'd prefer reservation to be Socio-economic based but a combination of the two would also work very fine 

Every year we on medical camps to villages and distribute free medicine to improve the health condition of ""Harijana"" and ""Girijana"" the tribal population 

Most of them still live in forests, some don't even have basic house, some get government built houses 

What i observed was that majority of them suffer from anemia, and the translator guy we had told us that they live on day to day basis, foraging in the forest and selling the nuts and fruits collected to buy basic food and alcohol 

The parents don't send their kids to school as they want them to help with foraging, for them i'd love see more programs in sector of education and jobs, affirmative action for these people is very much needed 

both on the other hand there should be a limit to reservation too, reservation after UG studies should be abolished, the % of reservation given should be standardized etc         /r/AsABlackMan  Before removing Ambedkar's reservations, remove Mandal's reservations.

It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***

Reservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India's inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a ""*necessary evil*"" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.

Reservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.

The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.

Why am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. 

It is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice.",conqueror_of_destiny," Do you think it is working? What I see is that even otherwise reasonable people get angay and resentful when they talk about reservation. I personally know a few people who talks about sc/st people in extremely bad manner. They weren't like this before entrance examinations after 12th. Now, whenever we discuss about writing PSC examinations, they are like 'Enthina? Kanda polyadikku okke kittum. Nammalu ezhuthiyikk karyamilla' Meaning: For what? Only low caste people(expletive) will benefit from such examinations and we won't get any benefit.

Another thing I have noticed is that these same people are getting more crazy about religion, especially Hindus. They feel that there is no one else to support them. So, reservations don't reinforce already existing caste distinctions in Society? Economic based scholarships would go a long way in alleviating this rather than reservation in jobs.

Once you have education in your mind, you get a certain level of self-awareness and self-respect. > The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse.

Ok, I'm a dalit. I've trying to learn about the history of dalits for a long time. Although what you've written seems like the dominant narrative. I think the truth could be much more sinister. 

In TN, where I live, the Dalit communities in ancient times still lived outside these agricultural societies. But there are several cultural practices, that would turn the idea that dalits were looked down upon. Several rituals in marriages and temple functions etc have a respectable role for members of these castes and receive their blessings. Some temple festivals start with the first ritual being performed from by a member of pariayar community. Then there's that sangam poetry which puts the paraiyar community as one of the noble communities. So there is a lot we are missing here.

But looking at the recent Y-DNA results and the cultural practices of the past. It's possible there was a shift in religious practices that resulted in the dehumanization of dalits. Dalits are most likely the descendants of the tribals that lived in the periphery of the cities. They lived in separate settlements because they are culturally hunter-gatherers. And there definitely was some mixing in the absence of a caste system. And they lived peacefully becacuse the post IVC agricultural societies knew they are descended from hunter-gatherer societies themselves and had hunter-gatherer gods such as Sivan and Murugan. 

The shift is the Sanskritisation of Tamil culture with the arrival of more vedic-leaning brahmins. I think there were other brahmins before who had integrated with Tamil culture and were okay with adopting local traditions. This could be one of the cause for the schisms that exist between iyers and iyengars in TN.  The beginning of the caste system and sanskritization of TN culture would have pushed dalits outside Tamil society in a power struggle for the cultural space of the Tamils with the brahmins winning. Today there are still remnants of this struggle. Lot of old kula deivam temples employ dalits as the priests out of tradition. 

So yea, in the last 1500 years condition of dalits have deteriorated to that of slaves. It just wasn't always like that. I'm a Brahmin too and yes I am not against the reservation but against the efficiency of reservation, my family was extremely poor and my father used to pull rickshaw and worked in a Hotel ( Included cleaning Hotel's toilet about 10 years ago ).

while I've seen abject poverty and with a family of five hardly managing food. In Urban area's most of Upper caste are never different from any other poor, even back in our village the situations have changed with hardly any opportunity  left .There was no government scheme that would help us. That's not just us but most of the relatives back  in the rural area.

Before giving my AIEEE and making it to an NIT, I didn't hardly ate anything for 2 days but water.

I remember my first day of college, where my room mate whose father had association with BAMCEF and grilled me for 15 minutes, as if I was going to discriminate his son. Ultimately he became a good friend despite his father brainwashing him when we parted from the college, to an extent that he admitted and hated the reservation system himself. Through years, he came to know about the fact that poverty strikes both Dalits and Upper caste the same way atleast in Urban areas. Dalits in rural areas no doubt have it worse, and even in Urban areas there is discrimination but it's certainly decreasing. His father was a professor in known college of UP, and he had a relatively cushioned life. Right now there is a generation of Dalits which has reaped benefits of reservation and are not willing to leave the same for the needs of the others.

Do you think the current reservation system will ever take out these communities from poverty ? there are millions of Dalits in Rural areas who will remain where they are because group of  Elite Dalits of Urban areas will keep reaping the benefits in a cycle.

>The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India.

If after 70 years of independence, if these efforts have ""hardly"" improved anything then don't you think there is something wrong with the reservation policies ?  By the current pace of improvements in life of Rural Dalits who are real victim, it's going to take 1000's of years. Back in the village a Dalit Family still faces a lot of discrimination, the situation in Urban areas have improved compared to that. The reservation should preferably be given Rural Dalits and then anyone else. I don't understand your blanket statement, a lot of communities within Dalits are now very rich and powerful, if we don't change the system this will be just another caste system.

&#x200B;

>Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded

I lost my mother to Cancer 6 years ago, a lot of poor people do. We didn't had money to get her treated in a good hospital. Certainly again government won't help us under NHP schemes the budget were allocated for SC/ST. Some of them being not utilised. We wrote to countless bureaucratic structure to help us, so that we could use the same under as we were economically poor but we couldn't. She died in extreme sufferings. Is this the social justice that you are talking about ?Reservation system in India is deeply flawed and it's time we start talking about it.

&#x200B;

You write very nice things, but I don't think you've seen the poverty as a upper class poor or even Dalit for that matter. Ask them and they would any day leave their caste / creed / religion and be whatever you ask them to be. /u/conqueror_of_destiny While I agree with most of your text, the aim of affirmative action is not social equality(inclusion) but equal representation. AA does not aim to remove discrimination, but to provide representation to those who have been historically oppressed.

Anti-discrimination laws exist to ensure social equality, while social schemes exist for economic equality. Paisa hai to status hai bhai. Agar paisa hai to untouchable also becomes a valued best friend you brag about Yeah. It's sad and funny that a lot of people nowadays think the main problem with caste system is reservation and the small minority that ""abuses"" it. i agree to you. but none of these reason justifies reservation to person who belongs to family of a civil servant, doctor, rich bushiness man, (economically strong) families. \>Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India.

&#x200B;

1. How do you measure social opportunity?
2. Do you believe OBC reservations  are a evil\\necessary evil or are they justice?
3. Why do you believe ""justice"" against those not guilty of discrimination is not evil? 
4. What social opportunities are available to a lower middle class Jat\\Kshatriya that are not available to a Sr level SC govt employees kid and how does an IIT reserved seat help the kid get those? Correct me if I’m wrong. But wasn’t the original purpose of reservation to uplift minorities in a certain amount of years and then remove it when equality( economically and socially) for all people is reached but then every politician decided to just use it for votes instead of actually uplifting the minorities. Truth is their are not much gov jobs compared to increasing population of India. Reservation in job doesn’t matter much.

secondly talking about merit based admission in colleges their are not much good quality of institute apart from IIMs and IITs and few other.  and IITs are also not that extraordinary. so pro-reservation lobby must understand that all students from sc/st/obc generally are less talented than 50% of the class. and it is very likely they will remain below avrg in their Batch. only top 5% or 10% are winners at the end of 3/4 years degree. 
and people against reservation complaining sc/st/obc stealing their seats they need to under that even reservation is removed u won’t amount much. 

I see whole reservation thing as dividing India more than actually helping SC/ST/OBC.  
their was a reason ambedkar did not want reservation forever.  

disclaimer: I am gujju bania who passed 12th science on 6th attempt, never went to college, ran family bness and now am mining bitcoin at Iceland. I don’t complain about anything and I get what I want. Thank you for writing this. Also want to add how oblivious most of us are about the casual discrimination that happens around us. It's almost embedded in our culture. 

I recently went home and heard two phrases (that I had been hearing forever), but their connotation dawned on me just recently. Basically they were like ""what you acting like an xyz caste"" (meaning - you are being dirty or messy like a person from the said caste"". Second was like ""you are looking like an xyz"" (meaning you are looking dirty and unkempt, again like a person from the said caste). Needless to say the said caste fall under SC. 

These are phrases very commonly used (at least in my hometown). The person using this isn't really a bad/mean/casteist person. It was just so integrated in the whole culture that even though the phrases are outright derogatory, they are just normalised. The discrimination is just so normalised. Why not both? we want reservations for poor Dalits. Look up Nietzsche's notions of master and slave morality and the concept of *ressentiment*. Perfect comment man (or woman). It's a shame that so few of the anti reservation people even know of the fact that it's not meant to be a poverty alleviation scheme. It was always about social inclusion and for all its faults, real or perceived, it has performed decently at this. 

There's a reasonable case to be made for more subdivisions in the quotas though. There is class within caste as well for eg the Meena Caste is more educated and powerful than the other SC castes. Most of the benefits are cornered by them leaving the other people in the same state they were in before. Such type of reforms and A Creamy layer exclusion can be thought of. The creamy layer will not be based on the logic that economic upliftment finishes social discrimination but on the logic that the benefits of reservation should percolate more freely among the deserving. Thank you, you have done a good job. But it's not easy for everyone to look at this in a non-emotional way or rational way, I kind of agree to the other side of the argument too, reservation does causes some more division and anger, being from a OBC and not using any kind of reservation till date.

But I'm more in support for reservations than against it. Agreed Some of the other developed/more sucessful countries that have reservation that I know of : China, USA, Japan. There are probably more. I belong to a lower middle class sc family. Two of my cousins who got high paying govt jobs, wanted to marry their respective gfs, both of whom was from higher castes. Both the girl's parents said the same thing, that their community wont accept them after they have married their girl to a boy from lower caste. One of girl's family were from Delhi, so it's not even a small town problem.

I don't see caste system being eradicated from most of the country for another 30-50 years. I know people who got 3rd division in SSC and isn't capable of clearing an entrance even if you give him the question paper a month in advance complaining that he couldn't get in because of reservation.

No, son. You didn't get in because you are a fucking moron. Even with reservation the current supreme court consists of almost 95% Brahmins. Imagine the state of our other institutions and the position of Dalit-Bahujan-OBCs if there was no constituitonal guarantee for their education and power.

 If the SC family is rich and on top of that you are getting reservations, why not?

Me and my friend were really excited to book tickets for it as it was scheduled to release on 20 September, 2019 but BookMyShow is showing the release date to be 27 December, and then when I checked furthur in the 'Coming Soon' section it wasn't even there!!
Any kind of info would be helpful thank you!",m_o_s_e_schrute," Ad Astra is definitely postponed. BookMyShow replied to some tweets that they have received an update the date has been changed to December. I live in Kolkata but I checked listings of other cities, all the 20th September releases like The Goldfinch and Rambo have been put up already. Ad Astra not releasing. It sucks as I was really waiting for it to release since the brilliant reviews from Venice Film Fest. But in India, even Brad Pitt can't pull people to theaters (fucking hell even Brad and Leo together couldn't pull people for Once Upon a Time...). So yeah they are shelving it indefinitely for awards season, it might even not get released. Being someone who is a theater regular and crazy about films, I have been disappointed far too often. This year itself The Favourite and Widows didn't get a release even after getting release dates and social media confirmation from the studio. Got pulled last minute. I fear the same has happened with Ad Astra. Its definitely not a CBFC issue since I couldn't see any content in Ad Astra (from the trailer and reading revews whatever I understood) that would cause problem or wouldn't suffice an A rating. Not gonna lie. Spent the last hour calling Theaters and asking them when ad astra was releasing. They said it's definitely not releasing this week, but might be the next. I wouldn't put too much money on that. 

It's been a pretty disappointing year for movies in India. Midsommar isn't releasing. And it's highly unlikely that The Lighthouse will too. It's fairly common for Indian cinemas to not release indie movies but to postpone movies like Ad Astra is a new low. I was able to find it yesterday, but now it’s completely gone from all apps. Last I saw, it did read 20th September on BMS and PVR app. Ok this is my theory. Ignore if its dumb.
There are 2 Fox movies(Mission Mangal and Chhichhore)  already playing and Zoya Factor is also a Fox movie releasing today. Maybe there are any rules and regulations that these many movies shouldnt be played by same studio at a time. So they might release Ad Astra after pulling out one of these movies from theatres, one to two weeks later hopefully.. Movies like chichore are selling out tickets but Indians don't watch movies like ad astra.

I literally waited for 2 years and all this makes me very upset.

When will Indians raise their level? It's very frustrating for a cinephile. This is the [release schedule](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2935510/releaseinfo) according to IMDb.. The Lion King and Spiderman FFH are getting re released for strange reasons no one will ever know. All Indian news articles say Indian release date is 20th September 2019. Unfortunately i can't find any Twitter handle for '20th century fox India' and bookmyshow support is useless about this.
We will know for sure by Thursday when bookings will start.
Edit: just saw it again under 'coming soon' and release date as 20th September. Hopefully tickets are available on Thursday as usual. I have recently stumbled into a woman on Tinder who loves stuff about deep space just as much as I do , if not more, and we have planned to go on a movie date(our first date) to Ad Astra. I have taken up the responsibility of booking the tickets and I am growing anxious with each passing day not able to find anything remotely related to the movie on BMS. I remember reading articles about Brad Pitt asking a NASA astronaut aboard the ISS on a phone call, as a part of promotions, about Vikram lander. But nothing is written about it's release at all. @FoxStudiosIndia is the Twitter handle Here's what bookmyshow replied to my tweet 

""Hey wewakejaw, as per the update, this movie has been postponed and the release date is not yet finalized. Thus, the release date is tentatively updated as of Dec 2019 on the movie page. For better clarity, pls DM us your contact number. -MB Rambo is being screened but not this movie. Sigh. Was super excited for this movie and now it gets postponed. Don't know why It's getting postponed though. As a lover of sci-fi movies, I was anticipating this movie for some time. It's disappointing that it's not going to get released tomorrow. Movies like these need to be promoted more in India so that more of the audience get to know the gap in cinematic brilliance between Hollywood and Bollywood movies. This sucks man. I was so excited for another deep space movie , I even put the movie release date on the calendar ಠ_ಠ 

Then it disappeared from BMS coming soon . I was so confused. Everywhere it said it'll release on 20th , no news of an indefinite delay was announced . Very sad. Maybe because they dont want to compete with rambo , I hope one or two weeks after it ad astra would have a release date.

Bookmyshow told me that december is just a tentative date and not confirmed. The most stupid decision by big Hollywood studios just shoes how much they care about audience and what they want pathetic. Wanted to experience this on Imax but no because some money making bullshit we won't get. Ready or not released in India I guess they don't consider Brad Pitt a star now. Pathetic Just checked on Book My Show. It's showing Oct. 31, 2020 as release date for Ad Astra. WTF? How can they push it a whole year later?? It disappeared from PVR app (coming soon schedule) when I tried to checkout the shows for this friday. Looks like Rambo is gonna fight the mexican cartel and then find Tommy Lee as well;) I don't get it, why would they delay the release of such a movie?
As far as I can tell, India has a growing fanbase for sci-fi I'm angry. It's not releasing in India and it sucks. Isn't is awesome that we broke the Babri Masjid :) Hurray for us! This sucks man! I was really looking forward to this movie esp. after all the rave ratings! This is exactly what happened to READY PLAYER ONE last year. The movie wasn't available anywhere in Mumbai :( 

As for the Dec 2019 release on BMS, I wouldn't pay much attention to it. I just hope they pick up one slot some time in the next two weeks to screen it. 

Such movies are meant to be watched in the theaters and I wouldn't wanna miss it. I'm heavily disappointed and pissed. I waited for it like hell and was updated about everything related to it - screenings and reviews. And now I see this. Can anyone tell me what might be the exact reason for this? They're releasing Goldfinch, which is getting universally panned and is somewhat an artsy flick but not Ad Astra, a sci-fi flick with Brad Pitt. I don't understand... Damn...I myself was searching for tickets considering it was supposed to be released today. Like wtf man...seriously...DECEMBER!!!

And then people complain about piracy in India. here :(

Not many people prefer to watch these kind of films but US, and I assume maybe the production company (FoxStar Studios India) looked at the previous statistics and took a call that it doesn't want to shell out and lose. Fuck man I was waiting for this !!! TPB, here I come! I've lost hope that it will release in theatres.
I'll keep listening to this beautiful piece of art from the movie till then.

And please dont encourage piracy, you wont do that if you love and respect films and filmmaking. Just saw the film in TGV cinemas IMAX Penang,Malaysia. India is missing a beautiful, hypnotic and religious cinematic experience. I can't even begin to describe the kind of emotions and melancholy that flows through you when watching it. Also a visual masterpiece that cannot be done justice on a small screen Ad Astra got postpone to December 2019, but it won't be releasing in india now. This is confirmed news BMS is now showing release date in Late 2020 oh man, it makes me sad. I really wanted to watch that movie on the big screen. Its on RARBG now. Its a visual treat. Wish i got to watch in the theater. Ahh.. makes me so happy to see people talk about this..Being a cinephile..this thing always made me so damnn frustrated..
I was completely devastated when I heard that Ad Astra won't be releasing in India..then BMS was showing that its gonna release in late Dec..and now when I'm checking it..it looks like the movie page itself has been removed..",2019-09-18 01:27:31

I am sorry if this post doesn't belong here or If it sounds like a rant but just 2 days back, I just came to know that my cousin's dad was attacked brutally by 2-3 goons in Dwarka at night when he was returning from work on his bicycle. He got off the metro at around 12am at night and was on his way home when he was stopped and beaten mercilessly. The goons didn't rob him and stopped only when they saw a PCR van approaching.

He is in the hospital now and had multiple scans done and is now scheduled for jaw surgery. This is truly heartbreaking for me as their family is really nice. They are a family of three, all of them highly educated, hardworking  and soft spoken people. He returns late from work everyday and rides his bike from the metro station to home even though he has a car just to stay fit while also reduce carbon emissions from his side.

The police doesn't seem to be helping much and are treating it as ""just another everyday case"", like this is normal and expected at Delhi streets. And ofcourse I expect nothing ever to happen to the people who did this, and I am pretty sure they wont get caught.

There seems to be zero mention in the media. At this point, all I want is for these guys to get caught, but the more I talk to the family it seems like that is not going to happen. [removed] Why was he attacked? Was there an altercation or was it totally random? Were the goons drunk? Idk why but this seems more like an intentional assault rather than your uncle being at the wrong  place at the wrong time. Unless their have been cases where the goons didn't rob We need an r/India vigilante squad. Are you saying he carries his bike/cycle in the metro? How? Sorry for your cousin's father but riding a cycle at 12 in the night is a really dangerous thing to do! That is the case of every city.

Scheduled,DO and DONT of flight travel ( Due to increase in flight anxiety threads and for future if anyone wants reference),19,dsirfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dsirfe/do_and_dont_of_flight_travel_due_to_increase_in/,18,"Mods kindly make a thread for it. Copy paste this content if you like. Flights are a bit of serious business and I can understand why youngsters might feel incredibly anxious 

Some important things to keep in mind first - 

1. Your flight ticket has to be shown to security outside and check in counter. It can be printed as well as shown from mobile ( Avoid taking screenshot of website from where you confirmed your ticket. Take the PDF/JPG which you get via mail from the site. )

2. All domestic flights have a STRICT 45 min closure of check in before their scheduled departure. So make sure that you reach AT LEAST 1.5 hours before your flight. In case you are reaching 1 hour before ( hurt shy of 15 mins for check in closure), kindly INFORM the personnel there that your flight is of that time. Often, they will start to call you themselves by saying FLIGHT TO XYZ area, anyone there. But to be on safe side, do ask personnel there.

3. Airports are supposed to be one of the best and most organized places of any city. So you can expect that there will be proper signboards to guide you.


DO- 1. Keep your power bank inside your handbag and your other stuff like knives,scissors,liquid greater than 100ml inside the check in baggage. 

2. Keep.your power bank, chargers, laptop in your hand baggage. 

3. General weight limit for domestic is 15 kg in check in and 7 in Hand baggage. 

4. In any doubt, ASK the personnel at airport, especially the airline you have booked. Like if you have booked Air India or something, ASK them any doubt. Remember, they are there to help you only.



DONT - 1. DO NOT PANIC during security check. It is simple. You need to keep your belts, chargers, wallets, watch, mobile and laptops etc in one tray and your bag in other tray. Don't worry, the army personnel there just look scary. They are, in fact, VERY helpful. 

2. Ok this is a common mistake women do. Your bags are Pandora boxes. Often you women go in security check and VOILA, you have scissors, knives ( MULTIPLE) and 2-3 bottles coming out of your bag. Remember all those items are broken there as they can't be taken in flight and you can't do anything for sharp objects. And you have to discard liquid if your bottle is filled and js more than 100ml. So kindly CHECK YOUR HAND BAGS BEFORE LEAVING FOR AIRPORT. 

3. DO NOT abuse the airline members for any delays which are not their fault. Remember they are mostly doing everything they can to solve your problem.

The central government aspect (offices, recruitment process) has been a point of contention for sometime now. What were they doing when his sister was a cabinet minister? Oh right, 2G 

Karunanidhi said Maran knew Hindi, and that's why he was being made a cabinet minister even though he was new to politics. 

Meanwhile he is also supporting 100% Urdu schools in TN for capturing the Muslim vote.

This family has never been interested in Tamil, except as a low cost political tool. If you read his father's commentaries of Tamil texts like Thirukkural you'll see how half baked it is. Bad interpretations and out right lying to hide the Hindu origins of the Thirukkural. It seems that the demand be that Tamil be given equal importance in central govt offices that are IN tamil nadu.. That seems fair.. I have seen many instances where the staff and the locals could not effectively communicate because they spoke only hindi or english.. 

It would be great if the staff also spoke Telugu if they are operating in Andhra Pradesh or Telangana.. It's called pandering people If Hindi is an official language, why not Tamil?

I'm a coaster. Lazy is the adjective that describes me well. Since childhood I've been a master at procrastination. This tendency of mine has caused great harm. I've lost a lot that I valued dearly.

I'm about to graduate I've had an epiphany that no employer would tolerate my tantrums. I'll have to reform.

At school I'd do just enough to pass. My study habits at college weren't different. Steadily this aversion from working percolated in my daily life. Obviously the consequences were disastrous. Now I want to get better.

 Due to my disinclination to work hard I'm not equipped with the skill-sets companies desire. My slothfulness has had an impact on my employability. Help me shed laziness and evaluate my strengths so as to become employable.

I'm unskilful. I struggle sometimes even at handling computers. And then I meditate on my actions and think that I may be less advanced mentally.",Hopeful_0," It's not unique lol.

Confidentsonofabitch It seems to me that you're suffering from an underlying condition. Most probably ADHD given what you've written. My advice is that go see a therapist/psychologist.

Once you make progress, go see a life coach/career coach who will push you in your daily life and add direction.

Very important to treat the root cause. Stay alone in a place far away from home.

Rent and hunger are two powerful motivators. read ""Atomic Habits"" asap. This is not unique and I am a procastinator too. Infact a very good one. But I have learnt to priortize my shit. I have found from my personal experience that I procastinated about things that I wanted yet the thought of failing or not having a desirable result somewhere in my mind made me not do it even though I enjoy doing what I do. The best way to do this IMHO is too fill your schedule completely. 

I am in Cyber Sec but now I have also started investing my time in OSINT (Military specfiic) & Homelabbing as a hobby. I am not aware of a lot of things in OSINT but I am slowly picking it up. Why did I picked up them as a hobby, you ask ? 

1. Homelabbing helps me progress in my career.
2. And OSINT is helping me understand geo-politics of the world through a very intricate and an intresting lens providing the ability to understand why are countries doing what they are. Also because its cheap and can go hand in hand with my profession.

So find a line of work and a hobby that you can keep up with. Little bit of procastination is fine. The question of change is quite complex. Don't fool yourself with ""over the counter solutions"" people give you.

You're lazy and you want to be active. So you want to be the opposite of what you are now. But what you want to be is just an idea, not a fact. What you are now is a fact and therefore you can deal with it. So the first thing to realise is that you don't create an opposite of what you are now and then chase it. That way you'll just wear yourself out.

Once that is understood, you're left only with what is a fact - which is, that you're lazy. Now you can deal with it. Start by asking, why are you lazy? Being lazy is perhaps an indication of not really being interested in anything or anybody. Now, why are you not interested in anything? Is it because you subconsciously see the mediocrity of our living? Then you can ask, why is our life mediocre? It's probably because we conform to everything that is being told to us. A second hand living in which there is nothing new or no avenues for you to be or express yourself.

Once you see the importance of not conforming to a pattern, then you'll perhaps start discovering what your true interest is. Have you ever asked that question - what is it that you're really really interested in? It could be something as simple as taking a solitary walk - anything. 

You discover it for yourself. That discovery itself will then turn into a passion for living. Jordan peterson on Youtube If that’s all you can think about rn, then you should probably get into some personality development program. I’ve seen many people participate in them for this sole reason get into any sales support role. there will be high work pressure but from your description about yourself, it will be an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object. so you will find equilibrium. Sounds like you have depression since years. I'm in my early 30s and been in the same boat. Its only since the last couple of months that I've started taking action when I observed that my professional and social life has become stagnant.

Start taking ownership. It all begins from there once you realise that you are responsible for your current state in life. Learn to prioritise and stick to a schedule no matter what. Practice mindfulness and staying in the present even though your thoughts might lead you elsewhere. Exercise daily in the morning, This helps you be active throughout the daily. Any form of physical exercise will do.   
It will be hard to practice for the first few days.   
Start focussing on finding your strengths or things that you can be good at and start working towards it. I've got two words for you: [DAVID GOGGINS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eClN__7Avuk). Focus on your health and diet. Get relevant blood reports for vitamins, minerals and T levels and opinion of qualified doctors. 

Start small on whatever you want to work on. Like just study for 2 hours daily for a week. Then, increase it to 3 hours next week. 

Focus on your addictions. There shouldn't be any, but if you are addicted to something, reduce consumption of that particular thing. First thing I would suggest is, fix your sleep schedule, sleep early and wake up early. I have procrastinated  through a lot of my adult life but since I have started waking at 6, I have some special energy that helps me complete any task, I feel fresh most of the time. Secondly, add physical activity to your life, it's way more significant than people think. Also, you have to fight yourself, slowly make whatever you do as a habit, make a schedule and force yourself to do it on time.Work or study what you like, interested in the subject helps alleviate procrastination. Have aim in life and get your act together. It's easier said than done but trust me, time flies and nothing hits harder than the feeling of regret. Try r/decidingtobebetter /r/DecidingToBeBetter

Boy could this back fire on them if not communicated properly. They should be really careful. It is kind of stupid of them to even talk about this before elections.  Mayawati and BSP with 40 seats in UP will ensure this doesn't see light of day ever. Fuck it. As much as I don't like Modi. 

India needs this!  ive always wondered why this wasnt the case iniaitally. a very good friend of mine always travels by air and she still gets full fees rebate and reservation cause she is sc she can easily afford everything but still. i hope the deserving gets scholarships  If this happens, it'd be wonderful. I hope it happens. Now, this will be a real forward thinking move by the BJP. If they can find the will to announce it in their manifesto.

Hope this isn't like the ""Abolish-Income-Tax"" hoopla seeking move. it doesn't say quota in general will go down, only same people will not be eligible again.






So the general category ppl don't gain anything from this. This is enough for me to vote for BJP. I hope it is not a hoax for my own sake.

Good job. Go ahead. Please let this happen. Will vote for any party that does this.  I doubt they'll actually dare to go through with such a daring move in power, but it's gutsy of them to even propose such a thing in election season when every other party is promising to increase quotas or to bring more castes under the reserved category. There are many places in India where announcing such a thing would be electoral suicide. I would be very happy (and surprised) if a major party actually supports this in the next few years.

Most probably, this is like that laughably idiotic no-tax proposal that is unofficially released by BJP to test public's support for it. If there is too much uproar over it then BJP will backtrack. While we are at it, why quota in promotions? I just don't get it. Good move. 

Except I think they need to tweak their definition of 'creamy layer' - 

> He underscored the need for putting an income rider to remove dalit families, which have an income of above Rs 1 lakh per month, from getting reservation in government jobs

Actually something like 20k per month should suffice, methinks.  This is brilliant & simple !

But why can't they just extend the creamy-layer cutoff used for OBCs, to SCs & STs too  ?
 this is what is needed - the political will to do the right thing, despite the possible unpopularity ...  > BJP is **""actively considering""** a proposal that will mean a radical shift in the country's affirmative action policy


...

>Senior BJP leaders who spoke to ET on the **condition they not be identified**

Let Modi or Rajnath Singh say this on record. Then we might *consider* believing them.

Till then, this is another P.R job. 

EDIT: Also Modi is beng paraded as an OBC leader. Basically Modi's campaign is indicative of his own transformation in rallies. It'll morph into whatever is dear to you, no matter how paradoxical or oxymoronic. Just like quotas were instituted for revenge against discrimination by upper castes, will there be quotas for revenge against those who got quotas in the current system?
 There is another loophole in the caste based reservation system that needs to be looked upon.

If a candidate from reserved category opts to take admissions via open category, their family from that generation onward should be considered opting out of the reservation, maybe even creamy layer. 

Although I know ""creamy layer"" is not the best description for this situation.

 Brilliant! Please make this happen!",2014-02-26 11:55:51

 2. Substantial upward mobility *losses* for Muslims.
 3. Basically no change for the combined Forward Castes and OBCs. 
3. Your chances of moving up in ranks relative to your parents are basically [unchanged](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DneOXpHXoAE9-c-.jpg) since before liberalization. In other words, while India’s recent growth has made almost everyone a lot better off, it hasn't changed the rate of churn at all.

 That greyed-out tip tho. The fact that this is only reflecting education of sons compared to fathers and not all children compared to all parents is extremely relevant and needs to be mentioned in the title text of this graph, not just the footnote/fine print. Because gender is so critically important in India (vs many other cultures/countries) especially as a factor in educational achievement, it skews the results even further.  Uttara Karnataka tho. Especially Hyderabad Karnataka. The difference between it and the southern and coastal regions is stark. ELI5 to the folks at home what upward mobility is?

Mass industrialisation is no longer possible. Millions of small businesses under the stewardship of Kejriwal is the answer. [deleted] And people get offended by BIMARU tag. See the red region. My analysis of BIMARU is that zamindari system is still intact there and the class division is also intact. We need a social disruption such as IT jobs so that the poor look forward to something other than dailywage.  Wait. Gujjus are doing poorly? Didn't expect that. Maharashtra is looking all good. But you have to consider that a Bihari immigrant to MH who sends his son to a MH school also skews the MH statistics in favour. This is also why the Bangaluru region is green. The South needs to secede from this Union of Fools.  UP is hell hole that everyone wants to quit. No wonder why up biharis are moving into my state Meghalaya, Assam and Nagaland are hellholes. Manipur is upwardly mobile. Who'd have thunk? Doesn't show full picture as it didn't capture all population, it won't be this greener. Major occupation in India is still agriculture/daily labor. Oh lord how do we fix this Im shocked we don't have complete arunachal pradesh or that data is not available.

I know it's been a long time I haven't updated what happened thereafter because I got really busy with them. It wasn't easy raising them, they are just like human babies. 

**The journey until the weaning process:**

Soon after making the post in the afternoon I went to a pet store and got Royal Canin (RC) Babydog milk. The making of the milk was very easy, you just have to add warm water and mix according to the label. it comes with feeding bottle and different nipples for cats as well as for dogs. You can use little more or less powder according to your preference, depending how well the puppies are able to tolerate. It had a very bad smell, so bad that I had to wear some masks whenever I used to feed them lol. After few days I got adjusted to the smell. 

also we found out that the babies are only 1 weeks old, their mom died on the night before we took them home.

Don't forget he milk: There's two options that are generally available in pet stores. One is RC Babydog milk and another one is from Beapher Lactol which doesn't come in large packs, overall RC is cheaper (still costly)

Bedding: For bedding we used a hot bag in the lower portion of a carton (big amazon boxes), then some clothing, bed sheet on top of it and newspapers on top of all of them. Basically created a layer so they don't feel the hot bag but continue to get a warm environment. The temperature is extremely crucial to newborn babies as they aren't able to generate or regulate temperature on their own, they rely on their mother for it. The temperature shouldn't be too much or too low, place your hand on the top of bedding if the heat is tolerable only then place them on top of that else just add some little less hot water next time or put some more clothing in the box. Too much warmth can lead to hotspots, blisters on their skin. 

You have to keep in mind their feeding timeline too. For newborns according to breed size (pariah dogs are medium breeds) you have to feed them 8 times in 24 hours. Again you can break them in even more smaller batches. I used to feed them every 1 or 2 hours apart. Gradually increase the gap when they grow up. Don't feed them too much as that may lead to diarrhea. [Here's a chart printed on Royal Canin's Babydog milk.]

When it comes to toilet they don't urinate on their own. You have to take a cotton boll, dip in lukewarm water and stimulate their genitalia to make them urinate. For potty there's no option so keep them over newspaper and replace them when you see them doing potty. The potty is watery because well all  they are just drinking is milk. If you see them covered up in potty just take some cotton balls and clean them with lukewarm water. 

Take care of mosquitoes too, I used to keep some mosquito coils, or good knight burning all the time. 

All was going well until I ran out of RC Babydog milk, I couldn't find it in local pet stores. So I ordered online from Amazon. Was getting good deal on 2kg pack. Sadly it could arrive two days later. 

I contacted some vet and they said to give them amul spray. I didn't like this plan as cow milk has good amount of lactose which is bad for dogs. Seeing no option I had to give them the amul spray by mixing in water. 

It went fine for two days, no digestion issues popped up. Meanwhile the RC milk arrived, this is where comes the saddest part of raising them. 

None of them were able to tolerate the RC milk for some reason, they instantly vomited. Being a noob we continued to give them the RC milk. Three went back to normal ish but one didn't recover. We contacted another vet who told me it's probably because of sudden diet change. They have extremely sensitive stomach and any sudden change would screw them up. The amul spray we used to give had more lactose content which probably made their stomach bad with the lactose content that is why maybe they weren't able to tolerate the RC milk later. Vet told us to give less amount of powder in more water.

Few days later the dog which was affected worse died. :( 

This incident took a toll on other dogs too, they used to vomit a lot after eating. We couldn't find why but came to conclusion it's probably because they used to drink milk in a hurry. So we made some changes in feeding timeline and went with small batches inbetween so that they don't become very hungry. 

**The weaning process:**

1 month later I started the weaning process with Royal Canin Starter as suggested by vet. I tried first by giving them as it is but nope, they would smell  but wouldn't eat. Then I actually read instructions. :p

According to instructions I soaked them in lukewarm water, wait until the pellets become soft then mash them and make a porridge. It also had a very bad smell but tolerable. The smell is extremely important because that's what makes it attractive to them. They would just gobble up their food. I used to give it 5 times a day. Morning at 7am - 10am - 12pm - 6pm - 9pm. 

Yes you can give them rice, daal at this point but some won't like it. It's easier to feed them ""mashed pellets turned into a porridge"". If RC is costly for you Pedigree has same starter food. 

**The worst part of weaning process, the nightmares:** 

After few weeks later they weren't eating the porridge. Again being a noob I didn't understand that it's time to give them solid food because their teeth has grown. Also maybe they just got bored. 

I bought Pedigree starter and made same porridge. This time they ate like they used to before but again some days later they lost interest. That's when I found out it's time for them to eat solid foods. Also found out I'm supposed to give them Royal Canin Medium/Maxi Starter and not Mini. Yes these brands have created different products based on size of breeds. Confusing af. 

So anyway I got the Maxi starter, they used to eat but again stopped eating. This caused me nightmares and I had sleepless nights thinking why they aren't eating. 

Now Royal Canin was getting really costly as they grew up so I tried Pedigree Pro Starter. They liked it a lot but after some day same result, they won't eat. I tried many brands like Purina, Hill's and same result on everything. Luckily they found cheap Pedigree milk and chicken tasty and business as usual. But another problem started up, some used to vomit after eating. Again we found the culprit was eating too fast and drinking a lot of water after eating which is normal in pellet diet. 

After 1 month In between of those pellets and vomiting we tried rice, daal which they didn't like at first, but they absolutely loved rice+curd (amul masti dahi), then as they grew up we started giving them veggies, eggs which also they loved. 

The schedule was: veggies like potato, carrot, pumpkin in the morning. Curd rice at lunch and daal, roti at night. Eggs once a day. Our family has turned completely vegetarian so no nonveg like meat. I know it's foolish, I do give them Pedigree once in a while and eggs. The diet is still the same till date. Dogs are actually omnivorous unlike cats.

**Poops, urine everywhere..**

You'll see them finding their own spot for urinating and pooping, it's extremely crucial to train them else you'll have to deal with poops on floor and urines. Watch some videos on how to potty train, or better hire a trainer. We didn't do any of that in time and as a consequence mine poops everywhere. Still untill they get trained you have to deal with the poops. Better get cheap toilet paper rolls from Amazon, Bigbasket. Buy their own brand like Presto, Solimo and bbhome. To clean the urines get a scotch brite jumper spin mop and some microfiber clothes as they soak more water. Also keep lizol, dettol handy to clean the floor after each poop.

**The de-worming process.**

You have to deworm them periodically before the first vaccination, else vaccination will get wasted. Like humans they also have tapeworms, a lot. Vet suggested us Drontal puppy. You first need to weight the puppy and give 1ml/kg body weight. 

Now how do you weight the puppy? Weight yourself first in a scale then substract it from the weight of you holding the puppy on the scale. Drontal puppy suspension liquid comes with a dropper to measure and feed the puppy. 

Be prepared to see a lot of tapeworms coming out in dog's poop. ALWAYS directly apply dettol, lizol on floor and mop during this time. 

Deworm 14days in between during vaccinations.

**The vaccinations.**

After two months from the post (from their birth date) it was vaccination time. Our vet came to our home and did all the vaccinations. 

* 2 months after birth: DHPPi - For Canine Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvo virus and Para-influenza virus.

* 3 months after birth - 1 month after initial DHPPi - DHPPi booster. 

* 4 months after birth - 1 month after DHPPi booster - Rabies shot.

* 5 months after birth - 1 month after rabies shot: Corona shot. 

From second year onwards you have to give DHPPi booster, Rabies booster, and you can give cororna but I feel it's not necessary as this virus is not widespread in India. So two shots in total. 

Regarding charges doc charged us 2k for DHPPi, 2k for DHPPi booster, 1.7k for rabies and 1.8k for Corona. This is total cost of three dogs and doc's charge for coming to home. 


**The first bath:**

Ideally you shouldn't give them bath until few weeks past the first vaccine shot. But you can use Himalaya Freshcoat. You need to spray them over their coat and dry them off with a towel. After the first vaccine I'd suggest to wait for two weeks and give them bath in lukewarm water with Himalaya Erina Coat Cleanser shampoo.

**Holy mites (and fleas).**

If you are adopting a street dog then it's most likely to come with some parasites. Often it comes from mom and environment. You won't notice them until they are 1 or 1.5 and even later days months old. You'll probably notice some bumps, redness, poor coating, blood. Sadly our dogs came with parasites and got [affected in the worst way.](https://imgur.com/a/ApNnu1n) As we couldn't bath them until vaccination we had to use erina fresh coat spray and Erina powder. Those didn't help at all, there was flesh wounds. We used to give Wokazole lotion, Himalaya Scavon spray and they did help to recover from the wounds. They were also itching very badly so doc gave some injections (after first vaccination) which costed us ₹600. 

Those insects also affected me and my mom. Mites spread fast and also on humans. Luckily they don't last long on human. I got redness and bumps all over my elbow and shoulders during that time. My mom got itching for a month! She had to take some anti histamine. 

It's an endless battle. This issue is still present on them, I shower them with two shampoos: bolfo and erina coat cleanser every week with spot on application evey two months. Their coat is way better now. 

**The fights and battles:**

I got two males and one female dog. Earlier they used to eat together but as they grew up they started to fight with each other during eating. One would eat other's food but won't let anyone touch their plate lol. So had to give them food in three rooms which I still do. 

**My deteriorating health during this time:** 

I was really frustrated with the redness and bumps all over my body, also got deeply scratched by them. The scratch happened before they got their rabies vaccine so I was really scared of getting rabies as I didn't have any prior rabies vaccination. I went to a doc and he suggested 5 dose of rabies vaccine on  day 0, 3rd, 7tg, 14th and 28th day.

 Then one day when they were fighting I tried to separate them and by mistake my thumb got punctured into one's lower tooth. It was very deep so I got even more scared, there was endless blood, pain. I washed my thumb into running tap water and also used detergent. Went to same doc in evening, he said not to worry as I was already getting vaccinations so RiG is not needed (Rabies immunoglobulin). He gave me instructions to complete 3 tetanus shots and gave some antibiotic ointment. 

During my last rabies shot I got pneumonia/bronchitis, wasn't able to get up from bed, Had extreme fever of 104-105 and fever stayed there for three days straight, also was experiencing terrible chest pain while getting up or trying to sleep. Mom went to medicine shop and they gave some paracetamol and antibiotic which helped a little but the fever woukd again shot up to 104-105. 

Four days later I went to doc and he gave me same paracetamol, antibiotic but also added penicillin.Which helped tremendously and my fever was gone in next few days. 

But after the fever went away the chest pain didn't. It haunted me for months. Doc prescribed some paracetamol to help and some syrup. In the end it went away. 

Meanwhile while visiting the medicine shop for my last vaccine of rabies they said it won't help if I get the rabies shot that time because it was late. In confusion wheather to start rabies shots again from day 0, I took the last shot and went to doc. He said no worries. 

**Finally here's how they looks now:**

[This one is a male, we call him babla/tiya(Bengali name, tiya means parrot).](https://i.imgur.com/WcIt2Xv.jpg) He's nicest of the bunch, always stays away from fight.

**Some do and don'ts for someone willing to rescue a puppy, or looking to own a dog:**

**Do:**

* Always consult a vet.

* For strays check with locals for approx date of birth, it helps. 

* Stock cheap toilet papers, cotton balls, lizol, dettol, newspapers. You are gonna need it. 

* Always clean floor with dettol after they do their business if they aren't trained. 

* Buy Erina Freshcoat, Erina EP powder. Use them until first bath, this will help with parasites. Also any clotrimazole dusting powder during rainy seasons. Wokazole Plus lotion, scavon spray.

* Deworm properly and carefully. 

* If you are giving them amul milk, amul spray make sure to use little milk, powder and mix with water. 

* Pedigree Pro is a good alternative to Royal Canin. 

* Fresh veggies and foods should be prioritised over pellets. (If you have time)

* Give them treats when they are nice and obeyes your orders. Like hug them a lot. 

* Trim their nails frequently.

**Don't:**

* Do not suddenly change their diet when they are young, this could turn into fata casuality. Always keep in mind the transition period where you have to mix some of old food with new food and gradually increase new food over the period. 

* For newborns ALWAYS check for bedding temperature. Make sure it's tolerable, not too high or low. 

* Milk is always a no no. Curd is good because it has probiotics which helps with digestion. My dog loves amul masti dahi. 

* Don't leave too much gap between meals for young dogs, if their  stomach gets too much empty they'll might vomit during morning or anytime. 

**Was it worth it?**

I would say yes, during this time I got really attached to them. I knew what it takes to raise a child. 

Yes they are always fighting, ruined our walls, our new sofa, our washing machine cover. Our fridge. They wake me up at 5 demanding breakfast, there was a time when I had to wake up at 5 to make breakfast for them. One urinates like fountain. One urinates everywhere. I always get scratched by them. We spent about  ₹10-15k in vaccines, milk, endless bottles of shampoos, scavon spray, Wokazole lotion, spot-ons. 

But all those nuisance doesn't feel bad at all whenever my sister comes home from work and they licks her face with love. You got to see them in person lol, they would make different sounds, gets all excited after hearing door bell then jumps onto her. Same with me and my mom whenever we enter home. 

This turned out to be quite a long post, so sorry for that. Also sorry to everyone who has pmed me and I didn't reply, I was really busy with all these.

I'm visiting bangalore currently on business from the states. 

Unfortunately I have not taken enough of my adhd medication with me (ritalin/methylphenidate) and only have 2 days left of it and will be here for another 2 weeks. 

Is there any way of me obtaining this in bangalore? I have spoken to a pharmacist and they kept saying something about schedule X but the language barrier became an issue. 

I'm happy to visit a doctor to obtain a prescription but I'm looking for advice on how easy or quick this process would be as it was somewhat difficult to obtain this prescription in the US with various different tests required.",Gyratetojackjarvis," Schedule H.

Schedule H drugs cannot be sold over the counter without providing some sort of prescription. You can get one from your doctor in the United States, or you can visit a local doctor in Bangalore, but if it's a local doctor, make sure it's at a reputable hospital or something. Get a copy of your prescription from your doctor in the US. Show the prescription to a pharmacist. If you are trying to get ritalin you might need a Indian doctor to sign off also.

Best of luck. My understanding is that the only way to get Methylphenidate in Bangalore is to go to NIMHANS for a prescription, and also purchase your meds from there. Methylphenidate is otherwise not available at almost any medical store, and hence psychiatrists outside NIMHANS don't prescribe it either. 

This isn't first hand information, hence I am not entirely certain about this. But I have ADD/EFD and this is what I remember from my research about medication options available in India, and Bangalore specifically. Also, I researched this 4-5 years ago, so this information could well be outdated.

Atomoxetine and Modafinil are the only relevant meds available in India, with Methylphenidate being highly regulated, and everything else entirely banned.

All the best! He can go nimhans and get a prescription. What kind of Chootiyaa forgets a critical medication when travelling overseas and that also a controlled one. A cheaper option may be to drink a lot of caffeine as it can help with ADHD symptoms.",2019-11-08 20:00:40

The foreign investors make money so they donate more money to fund elections.",runningeek," 1. ISRO has a publicly available schedule for all the missions. Chandrayaan 2 was in making for long time. ISRO also has to follow the planetary schedule and no one can change that. Also, the timing makes zero sense from optics view since we just had a national election. 2. I don't think this is even a conspiracy. Influential people, domestic and foreigners, have early and inside access to the govt policy. Now, I don't think govt changes rules so that these people can make money, rather these people always make money when govt changes rules. Irrespective, your observation isn't far from mine. What if The Chandrayaan 2 mission honestly failed and the tears on the man's eyes were real and Modi gave him a hug to console him and not only to impress his votebanks ? EVM hacking is real and most opposition is okay with it as they are also promised something in return by ruling party. This explains why Congress is keeping quiete on obviously critical issues.It is much easier for BJP and Congress if they keep public swaying between 2 sides as opposed to 3rd front forming up.  I am being shaped up to be the Prime Minister in 2047 on the eve of India's 100 years of Independence 1. Nope.

All I need to work is my laptop and an internet connection (a decent 4G signal would suffice).

What options does one have to cheaply spend a solid month somewhere like in the North East, Kerala, Ooty, etc., while being able to work from there? My only requirement is that I would like to have a room to myself, since I have an expensive laptop, which I don't want to lug around everywhere I go. Otherwise, I'm pretty low maintenance.

Would also appreciate suggestions for destinations! I'm pretty new to travelling and exploring, and am open to trying out niche/unusual places.",glocore," Saving for later. Ooty might be expensive as it's a popular tourist spot. Aizawl capital city of Mizoram might be a good choice since it's not as populated or popular tourist destination. Being the state capital I'm guessing it will have affordable internet options. You can also take up part time teaching jobs in any software training institute there that will help you to meet and befriend local people. /r/digitalnomad I've stayed in a metro as well as a small town. I'd choose a metro any day. Everything is available at a little distance, the best restaurants, products, events, hospitals, services etc. Running to the big city for every small thing isn't very convenient.

Among metros, I'd suggest Hyderabad, where I live. It's apparently the most liveable city in India, quite diverse, friendly people, less traffic than other metros and affordable. It also has great internet providers (my experience with ACT broadband has been quite good). [removed]",2019-12-08 21:59:55
Scheduled,"What are we doing parents, teachers and tutors?",9,evkkjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/evkkjj/what_are_we_doing_parents_teachers_and_tutors/,0,"So I am an independent education consultant from India - who has worked with kids in gaining admissions to top colleges in the US (Cornell, Brown, UPenn), Canada (McGill, Toronto, UBC), and UK (Imperial, Cambridge, Warwick). The past three years that I have spent doing this has brought me closer to the realities of teenhood in modern India. I have become increasingly disillusioned by the number of expectations we have from the young ones! I struggle to schedule calls and meetings with high school students because their schedules are so busy! I have even had calls at midnight in some cases as that's the only time the kid could find.

I am not even sure where this spiral is leading to? The kids are coached at every stage and even overcoached with tuitions starting as early as second grade and parents fretting about if their 4 years old can code?! As someone who grew up in the 90s in India - with a reasonable level of education pressure at the hands of the Indian education system - I sometimes wish I could put a pause on this madness and let the kids be! We have a generation that doesn't know the respite of the languid summer days, the hours spent in a limited screen environment just mucking about the house making scrapbooks, getting dirty or doing whatever the hell WE wanted. Now I know I am going down the rose-tinted glasses route - but as kid boredom leads to discovery. The afternoon I spent going door to door in our building trying to sell peanuts that I found in the house (to the utter embarrassment of my middle-class service job parents) taught me things, the time I spent trying to teach my brother math just because he was a ready audience meant something. What did that have to do with going abroad at 17 for me? NOTHING! But they are the fondest memories that continue to affect my well being even decades later.

A key part of me working with kids is exploring their dreams and aspirations when it comes to going to college abroad and when I start throwing around words like dreams and aspirations and interests I am very often met with silent stares or rehearsed answers that they seem to have heard from their parents at a dinner party. We have all seen the ads for tuition centres that promise superior coaching by IIT alumni or the mind-boggling number of apps that are literally in our faces all the time. The coding academy, the robotics classes, the tuitions for the school tuition, the study abroad fairs with ""direct"" admissions, the new swanky IB school, the freaking fingerprint career aptitude test (yep you heard it right) ... spiralling into a multi-billion dollar industry that profits off the parental anxieties. I have been part of it ... and I don't think I want to be at least till I think this more.

But, now I am closer to saying ""rehne do!"" or ""let them be!"" But then we add in the element of international admissions and we can't ""rehne do!"" So I think in India we love us some formulas - with parents that are a direct result of formulaic learning themselves when we look at international education preparation we just work better with equations. This much social service, this much coding, this much school activities, this much SAT etc etc etc. We approach the SAT like we approach the JEE. With the idea to ""Crack it!"" whatever that means. We put our kids in IB curriculum which is individualistic and intensive, at schools which promise the best teachers - yet send our kids lugging round to tuitions. I mean if I need tuitions after paying Rs 10,00,000 + in fees - what am I paying for?! Then there are those resume-building activities - the internships that you source from a friend of a friend, the certificates from causes and NGOs that magically appear and that the kids feign enthusiasm for in their essays. I think the study abroad aspirations hit our shores like the cyclone hitting Rameshwaram. And in the winds, it is the teens who were swept up.

I speak from the Indian perspective but if the ""success"" of varsity blues scandal in the US, or the rise of Asian tiger mom ideology is anything to go by the issue seems like an international educational challenge that we aren't talking about enough. I get it that we want our kids to study in the best colleges if we are paying millions of dollars converted from our Indian incomes - but I feel like there is a better way for us to approach this. I would like to hear your opinions as I continue finding my own way through this chaos. Let's talk people!",Felix9694,,2020-01-29 17:12:35

He landed in bengaluru from two day visit of Russia at afternoon of 7th September. In a day he did meet few people, went to ISRO center at 1:30 AM midnight of 8th September, stayed there late until 2:45 AM, though mission did not go as planned & though with heavy heart he left the place after giving a small speech of encouragement to scientists. Immediately in morning at 8:00 AM, he gave speech at ISRO, Bengaluru facility acknowledging scientists & the nation about Lander mission failure. After that we saw a moving interaction between crying ISRO chief and PM comforting him. This interaction really gave me chills and will be forever etched on my memory. A PM of nation comforting a crying ISRO chief on his shoulders. 

Well, If you think he stopped there, then you are mistaken. He immediately embarked plane to attain the inauguration ceremony of launch of new Mumbai metro lines. He gave a speech there. But before that he didn't forget to attain a 100th anniversary of local Ganapati Mandal. At noon he left Mumbai for Aurangabad, to facilitate 8th crore beneficiary under Ujjwala scheme and to open First Greenfield Smart city there. Another speech. And lastly at the end of the day, he was planned to visit Nagpur but due to heavy rains forecast he unfortunately had to cancel.

Now you tell me, at his age who works this harder for nation?  Do we really deserve him? And will people now be little kinder to him?",Gavthi_Batman," Guys guys we have found him .....
...... You are right. 

We dont deserve him.

He must step down. Lmao this is some r/theunkillnetwork shit. Imagine thinking that just doing speeches and attending inaugurations is ""working hard for the nation"". Guess who else also does these multiple trips for such PR events? Bollywood stars. Varun Dhawan must be one of our greatest freedom fighters, jai hind!  

> And will people now be little kinder to him?

Boy, I really hope not. He also cut the salary ahead of launch so it cancels out everything. Going by your previous posts you are trolling us arent you? :) Lol, dude the guy is easily the most popular politician in recent memory. He's probably never lost an election in his life. I personally don't like him cause I think he's uneducated but it'll be foolish to deny his popularity. The PM who sold my country to the phoreners by amending the Electoral Donations system gets no respect from me even if he travels all across the globe 24x7 for photo ops. No one has ever said that our PM is lazy. It is true that he is a good orator and works extra hard. Only if he had used his energy and skills for good purposes. . . I see the entire thing as drama - he knows Indians are emotional soppy things, and he was playing to the gallery. For him, India seems to be like a bollywood movie audience - take the audience through emotionals ups and downs, and leave them begging for more. That's more than enough to win the next election. Seems to be working with you! We need a smart, educated, rational person at the helm. He may have a busy schedule and he may be sticking to that schedule for the sake of his hard work but whether that hard work is of any use to the nation is the question you need to ask yourself. Credit for what? For doing his job as a PM? These are all gimmicks to influence people just like you were. I think ISRO did a fantastic job and have really exceeded expectations from time to time. It's nice to see the PM acknowledge their efforts but why would that change my mind towards him? Just because he hopped from place to place to give speeches? My respect for the ISRO scientists has undoubtedly increased manifold. 

Lol who works harder for this nation? Going around and giving speeches to raise morale etc is a good thing but aur bhi kuch kro in gimmicks ke ilawa. Downvote me all you want but all Modi's doing is showbiz propaganda and from the looks of your post especially the last line it did work on you and I am sure so many others. Are you for real dude? Are you this naive? Granted every major media house is under BJP's pocket but if you are just regular on r/india you might know how our economy is tanking and how unemployment is at all time high.This is the guy who follows abusers on Twitter for crying out loud!  

Our PM is just a showman. If you were impressed by his schedule yesterday,you might wanna look how rampant schedule he had for conducting rallies all over India.He is incompetent and overall a failure. He knows it and owns it. That's why his party has Media in Kaka's lap and bribe any journalist they can so that they won't highlight his failure.Kaka is also generous though. Since media can't show his failures he gives them material by making appearances/speeches wherever he can so that his Godi media can vomit all of that out on our telivisions.  

Let's see him work this hard for reviving economy, create employment opportunities and since he is so disheartened for ISRO's scientists maybe he could increase their budget allocation so we don't have to brag about our ChEaPeSt SpAcE MiSsIoNs. He is PM of our country.He can do so much more than just lending his shoulder for K Sivan to cry on infront of cameras. Is this Modi's reddit account ? That's the bare minimum Mazaak chal raha hai kya? From what I know & believe, a PMs job is much more than just photo-ops & travelling around. Could do some real-work maybe. Also, many global leaders are the same age & do much more. That video of him consoling K. Sivan might have earned him some PR points in national and international media. A thread on r/space was all in praise for him. But that doesn't change how his government has brought the Indian economy in downhill. It doesn't change how his government is polarizing India for their political benefits. Zor se kaho, Kehte raho Modiji is one of the most proactive leaders of all time. I hope it does not take a toll on him. [deleted]",2019-09-08 11:42:24

So I get a call back for an interview. They ask me to be there on a very short notice I asked for an extension. So the HR suggests a skype interview. I agree and confirm her via mail. I put in an sick leave and stayed home for this interview. It was scheduled in the morning. But I never received a call. I called them back every time she said she'll check and let me know. I was sitting at home all dressed for the entire day waiting for a call. At least she should have said it'll be postponed or something. But no. Even at 5 pm when I called she said she'll get back to me in a minute. Again nothing. Now I don't know what to do. Do i mail her asking how they can play around with people's time? Or just forget about it and move on. The thing is being in the core industry job opportunities are very difficult to come by. And such experiences depress you further. I just want that one fair shot they offered.

Tl:Dr : HR of the company where I applied for a Job called to schedule an interview and didn't interview me wasting my whole day and without any indication of what next.",adork_filter," [removed] [deleted] one suggestion after all pitchforks..

HR are not business..so some poor PM was told at the very last moment about your interview and could not excuse himself in time.

so reject the job if you dislike the pay, profile or fit. not because of some asshole HR Had something similar happen to me, I had a phone interview with the team but the interviewers never showed up. This happened on a second appointment too. 

I called up the HR, asked them if my candidacy was being treated seriously. That seemed to spark some fires and got multiple interviews the next day. I once had an HR of an IT company call me randomly over 2-3 days and demanding rudely where I was, and on the day of the Skype interview for which I took a half day from work, the project manager supposed to take the interview went missing. 

I swear robots would be loads better than such destructive people. this may or may not work for you and may have risks esp in same company. But just putting it out there: I once saw a mail from a person which was factual but ended with a bitter truth. The person had listed down how he had turned up on time for the face to face interaction and was not given support in terms of responses or a laptop to do his task and how he ended up missing his train due to delays which were no fault of his. No accusatory tone or anything. He ended it with a 'we are professionals so maybe some day we will get chance to work together'. This will tell the person reading the mail that one day they maybe in the receiving end. You can also consider telling the HR head or CEO of the company about your experience on LinkedIn. They are the ones who usually take it seriously. But then again they may just take it out on their subordinates depending on the culture of the organisation. Just move on and don't entertain them after this. Your time is important. Ghosting is a seriously common issue with recruiters and HR. 

I guess that’s what we get because they have tons of people applying and never in short of applications, at least at lower levels.

Good thing is they are being given the same dose of medicine nowadays by candidates who sometimes ghost them for interviews and even on day 1 when they are supposed to join the company. I don’t even blame them, you get what you sow. tweet to ceo with name of HR.",2019-10-03 22:23:07

Scheduled,Disappointing startup environment here in India,18,c3magi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c3magi/disappointing_startup_environment_here_in_india/,20,"As the title suggests, although there are some really good (supposedly) government initiatives on incubating infant startups but I haven't once come across a discussion thread related to startups in this subreddit. So I was wondering if you've a startup or did and it failed for some reason or the other, how was the experience? What lessons did you learn from it? Do you've plans for another one? What were some bureaucratic hurdles you have faced and how are you supposed to tackle them?

A fact that caught me by surprise was that the IT sector contributes 7.7% to the GNP which definitely correlates to the fact that the tech environment in the country isn't as impotent as suggested by various reports. Agreed that a significant portion of the software engineers are in need of a major reskilling but look at the bigger picture. India is a country of 1.3Bn people and out of it, for a small section of the populace who are into IT, to contribute close to 8% of the \~3Tn economy is damn huge! 

Considering this, it's hard to believe that, not even one of those millions strong IT workforce failed to come up with a noble and most importantly a sustainable business of his/her own. Anyway, that's just my opinion from looking at certain statistics and although numbers rarely lie but sometimes fail to portray a bigger picture of an underlying issue.

I'm looking to having an open discussion here and if it works out maybe I could try out a scheduled discussion thread on startups, to discuss everything from ideas to official procedures, etc. So tell me more about your startup(s) and help me understand the startup scenario better in this country.",the4thkillermachine," Startup definition in India is at nascent stage , valley philosophy needn't apply to village. What exists is convoluted definition where we try to apply philosophies of established startup environments like San Fransisco, London etc. here.

A startup in India has more business values to gain from street side vendor than what is projected on Tech Crunch, so let's be conservative when it comes to using the term 'Startup' and call what it is in India - A 'Business' like any another.

I started my company in 2014, when 'Startup' was not officially recognised in India by govt. in any form from a former village in a Tier 2 city. We built lifestyle products using funds from providing services to niche customers in VSAT space (Internet via satellite), Biometrics etc.

After a series of dud products, we saw our success with chat-app network dating product which was eventually accelerated by Facebook. Unfortunately,  the success didn't last long as I had to close my company this year because of my health issues (I was the single founder).

Though the reason for closing my company (startup?) was entirely mine, there were several areas in which I could have seen success much earlier only if I had started my company in a better ecosystem. Because I built international products, I had to compete with startups from better ecosystems like SF, Singapore, Tel Aviv etc. thereby in a competitive disadvantage.

The areas of improvement for the startup ecosystem in India are plenty both from government and in the attitude of the entrepreneurs . I'm now utilising my experience to help other [entrepreneurs](https://hitstartup.com) and occasionally respond to startup related comments here. A lot of gov initiatives are focused towards startups, accessing them is tough though. I my experience India has one of the most supportive startup ecosystems. What exact support are you looking for? If you want office space for a few of you use mine in Bangalore. Would be happy to help in any other way. Just reach out. Is there a subreddit for Indian startups? If not we should start one. Good idea. There are a few slack threads. Subreddit should help I wasn't expecting such response for this thread & I still think there's some scope for improving the startup culture in India. First thing first is to develop an environment to make open discussion, feedback, advices, etc. What's better than our own r/india, so I think I'll start out small with fortnightly discussion threads or twice a month and see how much traction does it create. We can accordingly either move over to a seperate subreddit altogether or come up with Discourse forum or something alike.

Anyway massive thanks to u/hitstartup and u/jdontherocks for your valuable inputs. Especially u/hitstartup, I've read your blog, the satirical comic strips you created are quite humorous and is pretty relatable. I remember this one time when I attended a startup meet and the people there were pretty awkward & boring, barely speaking anything interesting about their products but were quick to hand out their business cards. Besides, I hope you recover quick from your surgery and get back to actions since some of us can use your experience and knowledge in the field to hone our skills.

Looking forward to having more conversations such as this. Thank you all. Indians do much much more 'Startups' than you think. It's just that most of these won't fit your typical VC Fuelled Silicon Valley model of ""Go Big or Go Home"" definition of startup. 

In IT it has been quite easy to create a multi-million dollar outsourcing company in few years time with very high probability of success whereas doing a typical silicon valley like startup mostly ends up nowhere. Still there are a lot of product companies who have made sustainable business in internet space and went to IPO. Naukri, Shaadi, Justdial, Redbus, MMT etc. Others like Paytm, Zomato, BookMyShow, Practo etc are doing fine too.

And the most successful cash-rich startup has been Jio. It has all the qualities of a silicon valley startup with deep pockets - like Uber, and has disrupted the market just like uber did.",2019-06-22 14:26:55

I thought the press conference yesterday was for both dates. Every independent body, thoroughly corrupted. And then EC cribs about when security of EVMs is questioned. Explanation: Moral code of conduct comes into play immediately after the announcement, wherein you can't announce any sops, schemes or programmes that would sway the voters. 

Modi visiting Gujarat on 16th October I think. So are we all gonna hang around jacking off on Jio till Modi shaves and trims better part of his moustache? He is eroding every good institution of India, using all means possible to  get a total control of all states, total control of both houses and suppress or silence any and every critical opinion. 

This CANNOT end well. 

I can't fucking believe it but this madman has done it. I am going to have to vote for bloody Congress in 2019. Fucking illiterate fascist. and people believe EC is an independent unbiased body. Just like CBI! मोदी जी, कान बंद करलेने से भूकम्प नहीं रूक जायेगा . 

 #टॉपकेक  Why the delay? Ec bending over backwards for modi Gujarat is a much bigger state than Himachal Pradesh so the EC needs more time to finalize the dates. This is the only reason. But some conspiracy theorists will continue to malign a highly respected institution.  ",2017-10-13 15:45:15

As long as safety is a 110% guaranteed. Japan's bullet train technology has an unbelievable track record -- no accidents since its launch back in the 1960s. It would be a global embarrassment for India. ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**Piyush Goyal confident Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project will be ready one year before schedule** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Piyush Goyal exuded confidence that the bullet train project would be completed 1 year before schedule.

2 The officials of Japanese and Indian Railways have set the deadline of 2023.

3 Considering the pace of work, the project is likely to be ready by August 15, 2022, said Goyal.

Ahead of the ground-breaking ceremony of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project, railway minister Piyush Goyal on Monday exuded confidence that the project would be completed one year before the schedule.

Goyal said the officials of Japanese and Indian Railways have set the deadline of 2023 but considering the pace of work, the project is likely to be ready by August 15, 2022.

The groundbreaking ceremony for the ambitious Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Project, commonly referred to as the bullet train project, would be performed on September 14 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, the minister said. The ceremony will be held at a stadium near Ahmedabad's Sabarmati railway station. At the same time, foundation stone will be laid for a high-speed railway training centre at Vadodara, where 4,000 staff will initially be trained for the project.

""Country's rail network will be transformed and revolutionised after the advent of bullet train. Railway ministry has opted for Shinkansen technology as it has been a zero-accident train in Japan and I am sure the track record will remain the same in India,"" Goyal said. The minister added that bullet trains will also boost employment in India in a big way and that in future India will be able to export bullet trains too.

""PM has given directions for a holistic development of the Indian Railways. India's transport sector is all set to change and it is indeed a matter of celebration,"" Goyal said. According to railway ministry, the bullet train project will generate nearly 15 lakh jobs in India.

The high-speed railway line between Ahmedabad and Mumbai is expected to cover 508 kilometers in about two hours; the operating speed for the train will be around 320 kmph. The bullet train is expected to become operational by 2023. 81 per cent of the entire project cost will be in the form of a loan from Japan.

A senior railway board official said that the project has been put in the fast lane by converting it into an elevated corridor. This will save railways the hassles and inordinate delays arising due to land acquisition. An official said railways would now require 825 hectare land as against 1650 hectare with most part of the corridor going elevated.

Railway ministry officials said the training institute at Vadodara will be functional by the end of 2020.The facilities at this institute will be utilized to train about 4,000 staff in next three years, who will then be utilised for operation and maintenance of the bullet train. In addition, 300 young officials of Indian Railways are being trained in Japan to give them exposure in high Speed Track Technology. Keeping in view the long-term plan for human resource development, government of Japan has also offered 20 seats per year for Master's course from the universities of Japan, for serving Indian Railway officials.

Scheduled,ok lets have some serious talk,0,e10dmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e10dmz/ok_lets_have_some_serious_talk/,39,"i am going to get straight to the point I think that the schedule caste  system is corrupt and if being misused by that I mean that it is a wrong privilege for SC,s to get special treatment for ex  more chance in exams even if they score low or not  which means that the general is kind of being discriminated I am no expert at law so take what I say with a grain of salt 

then the point is that if the government didn't want  SC,s to be discriminated  then they should take away their privilege's  as most  hatred and discrimination by the general class toward the SC,s is that they now have an outright advantage in academics and college enrollment 

p.s this opinion was given by a 13 yr old",jiviteshkadost," A 13 year old won't have probably faced any situation or exam in which reservation matters. So its probably some prejudice or some family member speaking through his mouth. 

Best way to look at or judge something is by being detached from your identity of sc ,st ,general  obc,black, white. This is what arjuna did on the battlefield. Kid , what about working hard for rest  (100-22.5)% seats ? Hello fellow 13 year old. Don't worry about your writing.

Understand that most of your opinions are based around the views of your family at such a young developing age. The reservation system was created and exists for a reason which is to uplift backward castes.

However, it is widely misused. People who benefit from such reservation are not poor desperate people and can be economically better than people from the general category.

The hatred towards reserved categories are based around the reservation system but also are imbibed in the caste system and the aspects of untouchability which exist till date.

To abolish the reservation system or to change it in such a way that only those who can't afford education economically benefit from it, would take a lot of work and eventually abolition of castes.

Study the system if you have a problem with it and change it as you grow up. Since you want a serious talk, let me put the question straight to you. Who will bell the cat? I agree that the reservation system in India is skewed. I felt its heat when I was a teenager. After all, I am an upper caste. But we can talk about it next. The cat here is the upper caste. How does one make the upper caste not discriminate? Casteism is a disease that propagates from one generation to the next. It is this disease in upper-caste that made them SC, just two letters. I never saw anyone write UC to denote Upper Caste but we write SC without a second thought. How would you convince the upper caste to give up this disease? The reservation system is bad medicine to eradicate this disease. I agree. But do you have any other solution for this disease? In India only 2% of the jobs are government jobs and out of that 2% only 22.5% are reserved for the SCs and STs,  the rest 77.5% are still up for grabs for other communities. Since you are a kid, it would idiotic of me to expect you to have a lot of 'verified' knowledge as most of your current knowledge most probably is hear say. The thing is that the discrimination is not a result of reservations rather it is a cause of it. Reasons for having reservations are many and some people have already pointed them out to you like the 'affirmative action'. The other most important reason is to increase the representation of SCs and STs in the higher levels of decision-making. And do one thing Google this ""Crimes against Dalits in 2019"" and see what percent of those are due to reservation related hate(I reckon it would be nil). Be informed. You need to read about Supreme Court's judgement on this matter

Reservations are affirmative action to counter caste based discrimination Better argument should be, when can we end it or will reservation ever end.   

Let's focus on that, what can be the conditions or position when reached we can remove reservations. This will give us better view of the current situation and what we expect from our future. Simple. Ask Govt to abolish all castes. Then there is no reservation needed. Are you fine with that? You can't make an assumption about a country of 1.3 billion population.
I live in a rural area and yes there are discrimination still exists, they are still poor, but slowly making progress/growth.
I have seen these twitter trolls comes up with the picture of a guy cleaning gutters and write, are brahmins/generals going to do this?
Which is out of reasoning and bullshit, first of all if today you go to a people of sc caste and tell him you need to clean the gutters as you belong to the SC caste, he will slap you and kick you out of there.
Also people thinks generals are all rich and have no lack of resources is also false, general caste people are also poor, jobless, lives in poverty.
You can not just take away the reservation system in India, no one can, even this bjp govt. which everyone believe is anti minority couldn't take away the existing reservation but they brought 10% for general caste people and tried to balance things out.
Unfortunately India is going to suffer with the caste system for foreseeable future, and even if someone try to do something about it, politicians won't let this happen for their own benefit.

And for the common people,before you stand up for your caste/peoples and try to involve in internet arguments, have a look around where you live, I can guarantee there isn't one place in our country where people of only one caste are suffering from poverty. pls don't hate we have the right to equality 99% of the jobs in this country don't have reservations. Go through the facts before venting out. Kid, have you read the NCERTs? They will answer your questions better than reddit would.

To answer your question, you are mistaken. SC in Indira Sawhney and M Nagraj has clarified reservation isn’t discrimination against the “general “ category.  


In a deepy hierarchical society that for centuries has denied dignity and equality such affirmative action is required. It is present in ask the societies.

Also, the writer was very positive in his approach. This was a pure critique rather than a rant which we more often see. >The Savarna audience is presented with strong characters to look up to as role models. The Dalits have nobody. 

>In this quest to “lessen” the divide that Sinha talks about, Article 15 chooses to do something else: makes Dalits themselves casteist.

Scheduled,Pros and cons of living in Hyderabad. Feel free to add your perspectives or discuss how your city is better than Hyderabad in the cons department I mentioned here,69,d5drp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d5drp3/pros_and_cons_of_living_in_hyderabad_feel_free_to/,57,"Pros - 

- It's affordable for anybody. 

- Enough uptown cafes and clubs for anyone to explore.

- The distances aren't nearly as far as other metro cities. Travelling the entire stretch of the city shouldn't take longer than 2 hours. 

- The metro makes connectivity to all major areas areas and landmarks easier. The only place it isn't covered is probably Attapur and towards the Airport. 
 
- The airport is almost equidistant from all major residential areas. 

- IT/Corporate hub! Don't have to say more. There are enough opportunities for everybody.  Gachibowli and Hi-Tech city are so well developed that being a resident of this very city, I'm still in awe at how cool the corporate buildings are everytime I go to that part of the town. 

- It's relatively safe, for women especially. Keyword - relatively. You have creeps and psychopaths everywhere, but there are lesser crimes reported from Hyderabad.

- Most locals are welcoming and helpful.

- The GHMC and Hyderabad traffic police are responsible enough to act on infrastructural shortcomings, the regular water logging and the flow of traffic. They make communication easier with their WhatsApp numbers and apps. It's upto you to be outspoken and giving them information via their social media and helpline numbers.

- You see Hindus and Muslims especially living together in harmony. Temples and Masjids literally right next to each other. 
They're really indifferent to whatever the political mood is at the center. It's a good kind of indifference. You almost never see protests or violence in the name of religion, and this city should really be the hallmark of communal harmony for anyone to follow.

- Less traffic during the weekends so you can schedule your recreational plans then.

Cons -

- It's polluted, overpopulated, has a lot of traffic, but this can be said about any major Indian city.

- You have to haggle a lot with autos. They never follow the meter. 

- A lack of last mile connectivity from metro stations to short radiuses. Makes me change plans or compromise with visiting places which are just walkable from metro stations.

- Uber and Ola autos cancel on you if you pay online and not physical cash. 
Uber and Ola do surge a lot and you have to be ready to pay over a 100 to just travel 2-3km.  But again, this holds true for any Indian city and not particularly Hyderabad. 

- RTC buses are a nightmare. Unusable.

- It takes trial and error to know what routes have the worst traffic and around what times during the day/during what festivals. Traffic from Tank Bund is diverted during some festivals because of religious procession. Google maps can't be relied upon completely. 

- Secunderabad has the worst traffic. I was stuck in traffic for over an hour to reach a place which was just 3km away. 

- The weather is harsh - extremely hot summers and very cold winters. You have to be privileged enough to have air conditioning to survive the 45° +  summers. 
Off late, it's not even been raining as much during the monsoon months, and that is concerning in the long run.

- Lack of good colleges and universities for commerce and the arts. There are no good private universities or colleges for the non engineering fields. The Central University called Osmania University has the worst and most redundant curriculums. 
It's however, slightly better for post graduate management education.  
 
- I personally want Hyderabad to have more hobbyist events and activities in terms of art, literature, public speaking, etc. It is at a good place, but still not ""woke enough"" if I may. It can get better. 

Summed up everything I could think of.

I've been living in Hyderabad for almost 8 years now, and I want to move to another city to grow as a person and gain more perspective. But I'm glad to have a place of my own in Hyderabad and be able to ""fall back"" here whenever I want. It's one of the best livable cities for Indian standards.",lolwhyry," Pros:
1. Affordable - Both the rent as well as cost of public transport.
2. Food - Had to go on diet after putting on weight due to the abundance of cheap biriyanis.
3. Roads - Most of the major roads are well maintained, especially in Hitech city areas. Driving in ORR is a pleasure. 
4. People - Coming from north India it shocks me how simple and friendly people are here. Never had a rude conversation with strangers. Road rage here means that the drivers will yell at each other in Telugu and they go their ways. 
5. Safety - Burglary, theft and even pickpocketing is rare. In my 4+ years of living here, did not hear a case of mobile or wallet theft in public transport from either colleagues or friends. My friends usually keep their apartment door unlocked overnight since the cook comes early in the morning and nobody wants to wake up and unlock the door. I have heard the same story from many other people.
6. Language: A south Indian city where almost everyone speaks or understands Hindi is rare.

Cons:
1. Water: As many people said, water supply is scarce. Many societies need round the year tanker supply. Fortunately, for us its just the months of April-June. Rainfall was bad last few years but its good this year so I am hoping it would be a less issue next year.
2. Driving: As nice people are here, they drive like maniacs. Blocking free left - check, Not giving signal before turning - check, Driving on the wrong side of the road - double check. Also the traffic police is much more lenient that other cities such as Bangalore.
3. Nightlife: Although there are many places for nightlife, especially around Jubilee Hills, the majority of the crowd is north Indians. People here are very orthodox and women usually would not go out. The Tinder scene here will make you cry.
4. Public transport: Apart from the metro, which is great BTW as it covers the full length & breadth of the city, and Pushpak airport buses, the general public transport sucks. Buses are rickety with confusing routes and numbers. There are shared autos but going from one point to another would require you to change 2-3 autos. There is no meter system to you have to stick to haggling in case you decide to book an auto. Hence, people here stick to personal vehicles for office commute. No points about food..? Primary reason i want to visit again..! You forgot the biggest con, water scarcity. You have to fucking survive on bottled water for drinking and water tankers for other purposes. There's no water. Enough said. Pros: food (how did you miss this?)


Cons: nightlife It rained like fuck tonight Osmania is a state university and not a central university. And yes, there are not many good arts colleges (probably because there is no demand at all for good quality arts colleges). Cons: No good weekend getaways. (Change my mind)

And by that I mean, all good places to visit are 14-15 hours away (Goa, Kodai etc.). The only 8 hour drive destination is Hampi I disagree on the ""safe for women"" part. I have had my worst experiences of traveling solo while living in Hyderabad. Stalking was extremely common. Many of my female friends got frisked by passing by bikers and autos while walking. It was almost a norm to be called out ""hey baby"" while crossing the road. Sorry, this is almost on tangent to your thread. But hyd has a huge ""road Romeo"" issue. I noped the hell out of that place. Biryani! \> It's affordable for anybody.

\- Lol which part of the city do you live in. Rents in Gachibowli/Financial are sky high. 40-50k for a 3BHK in a gated community is not cheap.

\- Public transport, not just RTC buses is a mess in Hyd. The public transport infrastructure is next to non existent in the industrial/IT area, and Ola/Uber are the only choice apart from shared autos (which only run in selected routes).

\- Power cuts are pretty common. Lived in other metros and barely saw any power cuts.

\- Summers are hot for sure. But calling winters extremely harsh is too big of an overstatement. If you have lived above the tropics in India (not the hills, even the plains), you would know what winters actually mean. Post this on r/hyderabad if you haven't already ! What about language issues? Cons:

\- Not 420 friendly.

\- Police officers are always harassing. Was born and brought in Hyderabad old city and now I am working in Bangalore. Honestly I don't like the current crowded Hyderabad as much as I used to love it in the old days. Every road is so damn crowded that you hardly shift beyond second gear on your motorcycle or car.

Scheduled,I have been getting calls from some organization called Child Help Foundation and want to know if they are legit.,19,d6dy01,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d6dy01/i_have_been_getting_calls_from_some_organization/,18,"So some lady called Seema contacted me yesterday asking me to donate some money for some child's operation. I was outside at the time and asked her to contact me later. So she called me again today. When I asked her where she got my number from, she is not replying. On repeatedly asking, she said some database (but was very vague about it). I started asking her multiple questions about the disease and treatment and all she said she will send me pictures and documents about it, but was once again, very vague. On asking her more questions about the hospital, she kept saying they are legit and the child needs help. When I bluffed and said that since I am a journalist, let me do some background check and get back to you, she sounded a little concerned and said okay and asked me to call back when I can.

Now I have been doing some research and found a website and all for this, but there is absolutely no buzz on the thing they want to the fact that it seems made up. I found something about the child she mentioned and apparently the surgery was scheduled for yesterday, so dunno why she is calling me today also. I found a similar letter of appeal from the doctor she mentioned by name, but for another child. I don't know, a lot of things about this whole thing seem fishy.

**TL;DR - I wanted to know if anyone has gotten a call from some Seema (or anyone else) from Child Help Foundation asking for a donation for a child called Sia Samanta who's operation costs 16.5 Lakhs. If it is fake, I am legit going to a journalist friend and tweeting to the cops about this shit along with her number and all so they don't exploit other people.**",sleepygamer92," No one would ask random people for money if some kid is undergoing operation, this only happens in Bollywood. If I were in your place, I wouldn't take a second to hang up I also got a similar call, it was regarding the treatment of 8 year old kid suffering from cancer, i asked them to mail me the details and pic of the victim- they did, but still i had my concerns.. i said i wanted to visit the hospital myself and he ws fine with that too, gave me the address and all... I gave 2000/- rs but the thing is, the calls just kept pouring in after that.. like every month. Donating such amount once every now and then is fine but you should not make a business out of it, they started demanding a larger sum (7000) so i declined them in a strict tone.. now i dont get the calls but i still have my doubts about their legitimacy. If somebody calls you and you don't know them and they are not somebody you have to talk to for work, just hang-up. Don't entertain them. These people are not legitimate. I remember somebody posting a very similar case a few months ago. Maybe if you search for it, you'll be able to find it. These cases are very common. You know your situation best but I would urge you not to get involved further by ""tweeting to the cops"". Ha got a call the other day here's what I said:

""See if I am donating then I should be able to choose who to help and since I have only so much to give, I can't help everybody, so when you call me and ask me for money for kids then it puts me in a spot such that I become the bad guy if I don't donate.""

She had absolutely nothing to say after this monologue and she said okay and hung up. Okay, wtf. I got a similar call too from some foundation. I was too busy to pay attention so I just told her I'll get back to her later but she did mention something about a kid with leukemia who needs money.",2019-09-19 21:19:45
Scheduled,Please help me out.,31,dr3nqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dr3nqk/please_help_me_out/,15,"Hello r/India.
This post is a bit personal, just need help and some mental peace.If my sentences are a bit incoherent please forgive me because I'm overwhelmed with emotions at the moment. 
So here begins my story,I (24M) was born and brought up in Kerala. I got through the medical entrance exam and took up a medical seat in Maharashtra . Didn't have any problems but felt homesick finally got over it and started studying for my future in medicine. The first semester in Ist M.B.B.S goes very good, my problems begin in the second semester where i start having issues with my health.During this period i consulted many doctors. I'm unstable and bed ridden, taking multiple pain killers and muscle relaxants prescribed by them.The doctors aren't able to give me a diagnosis a few months pass keep in mind even in such a state I'm studying. I give my prelim examination and barely make it. I'm geared up to give my Ist M.B.B.S exam. My health takes a turn for the worst and now I'm unable to move, my parents come all the way from Kerala. They aren't able to see me in such a state and they take me back to Kerala . They get me checked up and within 2 days the competent doctor gives me the diagnosis, i have T.B spine. My parents are shell shocked, my mother starts crying. I felt numb. I felt helpless. My treatment schedule is put in place and i start with my medication. The treatment plan was for a year, with physiotherapy. Luckily the  vertebrae involved ankylosed without causing a need for surgical involvement. I healed physically. Now my treatment was done,  i was healthy. But during this period all the friends i had made in my college, were now strangers. I had become a social pariah. I didn't disclose my illness except to 1 close friend who was also from Kerala . He kept me updated on what was going on in college even though he had moved to the second year. I had completed my treatment and had to sit for the Ist M.B.B.S exam. With 2 months left after my treatment, i give it my all and with the grace of God i make it through. Now begins the second year, I'm with a completely new batch. I became a junior. Nobody knows who i am. I thought i get a fresh start. But slowly the news spreads and they get to know that I'm from their senior batch. Initially they assumed i was a transfer. Initially people tried making small talk with me and i was soon ""friends"" with a few of the people from this batch. Slowly i was isolated and my ""seniors"" wanted nothing to do with me. I was completely alone, even my close friend got busy with his life and abandoned me aswell. My parents kept asking me how the new batch was and if i had adjusted. I lied to them just to make them feel better that everything was perfect. Keep in mind my parents are doctors and they have extremely busy schedules and I didn't want to burden them further. Now somehow i have kept myself together with the support of my parents, the only people i talk to are my parents. I somehow made it through the second and third year aswell, now I'm in my final year. This year has been nerve-wracking. All i do is study, eat and sleep. I'm completely alone. All the ridicule i face from my batchmates and juniors has got me all messed up ( for something that wasnt my fault at all). I don't know who i can trust anymore.I have no one in my life besides my family. There is only so much I can take. I'm in another state away from home questioning my sanity. My batchmates are now in internship. They'll graduate soon. Everyday i keep thinking what i had done to deserve this. I keep thinking is it worth it to even live anymore.  Why should i pain myself to become a doctor at all under such pathetic conditions? Why should i have to live with this? If this is how the society is I'd rather be dead.",Throwaway_851216," Your mental help doesn't seem to be good 

Go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist it really helps a lot.  You don't need to have friends you can spend time doing things you love, writing, blogging, playing games and often traveling alone.

I went through 4 years of my engineering without having proper friends in my college. I had mental problems used to do self harm and once broke my head with a glass. You just need to hang in there mate never ever give up.

Go hit the gym it helps to. I understand its difficult but hold your head high and finish your studies. People will always talk and as ""doctors"" of the future its quite ridiculous on their part. I don't have any advice to offer as this is not due to any fault of your own but my DMs are open if you ever need someone to talk to or just listen :) You are in your final year now. Soon you'll graduate too. Don't worry about those who don't value you. You probably won't ever meet them once you become a professional doctor. Don't think about others. Just think about yourself now. And if you can take some time out, then try to invest that time in some hobby. 

You'll meet friends too. Maybe later in your life. The past is not under your control but the future is. So focus on that. Be confident.

I'll also suggest getting professional help. Please try that too. I think this is an opportunity to make friends outside of the 'current-potential' new friend circle!

Meet people from other walks of life. Make friends with the nearest restaurant owner, meet bankers, CAs... join an activity group!!

Find friends from other fields of study. 

None of these guys would likely matter once you graduate. If you are doing well in studies, eventually someone will join you in group studies!

Make it happen OP! Man, don't you have a laptop or something to watch movies or play games by yourself ? Being alone isn't the worst thing in the world Everything is Okay 
Don't feel bad about anything you have gone through 
Firstly , Accept the fact what you are now 

The thing is you are feeling shy about the things happened to you 
Accept them 
Everything flows with the time",2019-11-04 01:31:42

Let's discuss these manifestos!

",rahulthewall," It is ironical that these manifestos are so optimistic and ideal and yet each Government since as far as I remember fails miserably. No doubt, improvements were made but the pacing is so slow compared to the humongous problems - both social and economical- that I feel hopeless whether I look at these parties. At this stage, I am just wishing that these Sanghis just go away. I don't want another social evil devouring this country. This brazen propaganda and shameful communalization must stop at all cost.  we have to wait years when well-being of our countryman is the first and last topic in any political debate. Congress:

>Congress promises to pass the Constitution (Amendment) Bill to provide for reservation of 33 per cent of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies in the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha. 

BJP:

>Reservation for Women - BJP is committed to 33% reservation in parliament and state assemblies through a constitutional amendment.


They seem unanimous, yet the bill won't pass. Or will it? I'm a first time voter and honestly this is a lot to take in. I can't decide whom to vote for. So, how do I go about doing a SWOT analysis, so to speak, that might help me take an informed and unbiased decision as to who deserves my vote? I really don't want to hit the NOTA , I'd rather sit at home then.  
Edit : I'll read both manifestos properly and use my own faculty of reasoning and common sense to decide. Thanks for the input folks! Thank you for this quality post. I really like this apprenticeship point. Training of work force is seriously lacking in India, especially the trades like plumbers, electricians etc. [removed] Looks like the sangh got spooked by the congress manifesto, and the response was to hurriedly put a lot of big numbers together. 25 lakh crore investment for agriculture and 100 lakh crore in infrastrcture in 5 years, just to name two big items on the list.

This might be ok if not for the irony of the sangh asking congress where the money for their schemes will come from. Manifestos of other parties --

I know the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the DMK released their manifestos, but can't find anything on their website. No mention of any manifesto on Aam Aadmi Party, Janata Dal (Secular), YSR Congress, Shiv Sena or Bahujan Samaj Party websites. When no one implements what is written, what’s the point in discussing. How many past governments have fulfilled at least 70% of their manifesto? Am I being dumb or is there something to worry about Simultaneous Elections? Mods can we have this thread stickied? Maybe include discussions of manifestos of other major parties too?

And thanks OP. [deleted] To those of you saying 33% reservation in parliament will lead to proxy women being installed on behalf of their make counterparts: this was the same argument given when panchayats were mandated to reserve one seat out of five for women. This myth has been debunked. Only in a marginal percentage do women act as proxies, otherwise they're always rational autonomous agents (as much as allowed by the party whip). This is a fantastic bill and extremely necessary for all the underrepresented women of our country. Can Anyone please explain what is ""Combating Left Wing Extremism"" in the BJP manifesto is ?
Also why it didn't say much/anything about Right wing Extremism when we have seen visible growth in past couple years ? > Instututions - Congress promises to amend the Anti-Defection Law to provide for instant disqualification of a Member of Parliament or a Member of the State Legislature for proven disobedience to the party’s whip...

No. You can disqualify them for changing sides because that is not what I vote them in for. But you cannot disqualify them for disobeying party orders. That kills democracy.

I vote for my candidate. He acts on my behalf. I do *not* vote for a party slave. It is in my benefit that he can disobey his party. This is the only outlet of a politicians integrity today.

Remove this and we become a farce Amit Shah ki shakal dekh ke toh bilkul mann nahi hua manifesto padhne ka What’s uniform civil code again?

BJP manifesto > * Arts -  **Congress will guarantee artistic freedom**. Artists and craftsmen will enjoy the freedom to express their views in any form without fear of censorship or retribution.

NICE!

> * Reservation - Congress promises to amend the Constitution to provide for **reservation in promotion posts for SCs, STs and OBCs.**

Oh. Fuck.

I don't know what to do :( Congress manifesto says it will make the supreme court into a constitutional court, but doesn't the supreme court use the constitution already for its verdicts? Here I can see most of the people are appreciative of the Congress Manifesto as being socially progressive. Never would have imagined something like this 5 years back. 

But many have shown their concern regarding the funding of the NYAY scheme. I want this scheme to work. I just hope Congress gets the funds by taxing the HNIs, like what is being proposed by AOC in the US - **70% Tax on the 10 millionth dollar**. I don't know if Congress govt can pull this off. > * Digital Rights - Pass a law to protect the personal data of all  persons and uphold the **right to privacy;**

Personal Data Protection Bill? I noticed most points in INC's manifesto are measurable goals where BJPs is mostly non-measurable statements... I care mostly about their economic goals. It feels weird when the Congress has more tangible pro-business policies than the BJP. They should’ve included more details around stimulating the economy. Off topic but couldn't the BJP find a better picture for this page? I cannot stop laughing.. [Here, take this pearl of wisdom.](https://i.imgur.com/Beq0IQc.jpg) > Citizenship Amendment Bill - Hindus, Jains, Buddhist and Sikhs escaping persecution from India's neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India.

rohingya muslims have left the chat I have never seen a more whataboutery manifesto than that BJP manifesto I'll gild anyone who does a post of BJP's 2014 Manifesto and list the things they delivered/ did not deliver. BJP's manifesto:
Hindus, Jain's, Buddhists and Sikhs will be given citizenship wtf. Does anyone see major Indian religions missing from this list? Whats with bjps obsession with year 2022?  Can we forget about the manifesto for a second? Went to buy some cement today and was told each bag is 45 rupees more expensive. The shakha daftars of BJP are pocketing that 45 rupees. Can we talk for a second about that? Both the manifestos are a very good reflection of the ideologies of each party. 

BJP remains true to its Hindutva roots. It reiterates a Hindu centric government where:

* Persecuted Indic faiths from neighbouring countries become eligible for citizenship. No such concession given to persecuted Muslims in Burma or Christians/Ahmediyyas in Pakistan. 
* Focus on extermination of left-wing terror. No mention of caste or religious violence that is regularly fanned by sangh outfits. 
* Promising the construction of Ram Mandir.
* Promoting measures to combat the entry of women in Sabarimala.

I can't ideologically agree with amending the constitution to give certain religions a preference when it comes to Indian citizenship. That's not what India is supposed to be. Also, while their stance of abolishing triple talaaq and nikah halala is commendable, their stance on Sabarimala indicates that they are not interested in giving equal rights to women. They are only interested in reforming Islam because it does not anger their core vote base. Regressive practices in both religions should be called out equally.

Congress' manifesto on the other hand champions social justice.

* Abolishing offences of sedition and criminal defamation. 
* Promising no censorship for artists.
* Right to Privacy.
* Increased spending on health and education. 
* Appointing a diversity commission.

It takes social justice to extreme (in my opinion) levels by promising:

* Reservations in promotion.
* Reservations in central government jobs of 33% to women.

Another disturbing factor is the strengthening of the anti-defection law. That, for me, is contrary to the spirit of parliamentary democracy. 

Judging from the manifestos, I believe this will be a watershed election for India. It is time for us to decide whether the identity of India is Hindu or are we a syncretic mix of different religious traditions where diversity is not only respected but celebrated. 
 So far it seems that Congress’s manifesto promises more liberty, freedom and expression, increased institutional accountability, more nuanced defence and internal security policy and some radical economic ideas as well. 
Whereas BJP is parroting the same thing they promised in 2014 or since then with the peculiar target of 2022.
Congress has won this manifesto game (if there is one) by rather giving and presenting a vision, which they have been utterly lacking in these last few years, than targeting BJP with a negative campaign like a threat to country, constitution and institutions which may backfire and not resonate with the larger population that still cares for food, water and jobs. In my opinion this positive campaign and presenting the electorate with something to look forward to is the best thing about the congress manifesto.  Congress has also released a 44 page document prepaered by Lt Gen DS Hooda, the architect of the the 2016 Surgical Strikes. 

National Security Strategy document by Gen Hooda. 

https://manifesto.inc.in/pdf/national_security_strategy_gen_hooda.pdf From the BJP Manifesto, page 32, point 11: 

> Women's security will be given more priority. We have constituted the Women's Security Division in the Home Ministry, and have made strict provisions for transferring the laws **in order to commit crimes against women**, in particular in a time-bound investigation and **trail** for rape. In such cases, forensic facilities and fast track courts will be expanded to bring **convicts** to justice.


* ""In order to commit crimes against women"" - slight Freudian slip there. 
* ""Trail"" - I mean, the road to justice is long in India, but that long?
* ""bringing convicts to justice"" - if they are convicts already, why are you trying them again? Or is guilt supposed to be assumed in these cases? 

Such attention to detail. Aur karo vote for development. 
 Came here to see Mandir lollipop. Was not disappointed. I'd rather drink the Kool Aid at Jim Jones's convention than believe in the BJP manifesto. all of their promises are empty. The only thing they will follow through on is the Ram Mandir temple to pander to their base of ""shit for brains"" Hindu nationalists. 

&#x200B;

Also. nothing on pollution or the environment after they caused the degradation of the environment and made China look like Switzerland. whats wrong with neet examination? Congress's manifesto looks more mature, actionable.

BJP's counterpart reads like rhetoric Given BJP republished the 2014 manifesto, does anyone else see this also acts as a report card for the BJP? BJP seems to have forgotten about the Smart City which is unfortunate. I am surprised by such a civil discussion on politics. We are seeing such a mix of varying ideas. You should see the  r/pol which is political discussion of US. Its a shitshow circlejerk  out there. I think the BJP’s promise of building a warehouse network across the country is an immediate requirement - whether they deliver is an entire different story. Basically BJP is we couldn't finish it in 2019, so by 2022 we'll do it (Their deadline were that from the start maybe to claim it even if they didn't do work). Nothing new to see here.

Congress gives lots of spending goal but not how they will get money, BJP is more like we'll build infra structure but too much infra with no use could lead to bankruptcy like China is doing to other countries.

Many positive things in congress manifesto can be extremely bad e.g. aprenticeship instead of hiring a guy, make him work as aprentice (my brother worked for 3 years as a ""trainee"") low pay and firiable without much problems as they technically wouldn't be considered employee. And how can you force private to do anything and pay for it? How will you enforce it? Courts might strike it down.

Fill jobs: How are there qualified people available? If not how will you fill it? Saw the news article of not enough jobs with 9-12 pics of people with their name, year and degree written on the blackboard behind them. 4 had their degree spelling wrong and 3 were Masters or PhD. I'd rather not hire them in jobs (they had access to internet and everything. I'd rather have a doubtful average guy than a bold stupid guy e.g. Trump)

Application fee waived: Nice but not too costly anyways. People will fill form and not go. Maybe give them a fine if they don't attend as paper is wasted.

Make India manufacturing hub: How? Maybe next points

Make for the world: I see what you did there. Nice idea but I don't think people set up shop in India as we have low tax, our main + is cheap labor, maybe focus more on ITI and skilled labor, give them stipend? And we are reducing our revenue, maybe they'll increase it in other points.

Patent acquisition: DO NOT DO THIS. I don't want government to subsidize industries and which patent would they buy? For small(definitely) to medium(maybe) industries don't follow much of norms and have lot of lee way. No one is going to ask did you pay royalties for the patent? Unless the patent owning company or individual is going around and doing round of small industries in India no one would be the wiser (most of India runs on pirated software and duplicate of original products) don't waste money.

Independent mayor: Really you want more elections and make it confusing people to vote? What will happen if there is an impasse. Blame game and stuff along with partisan politics. From personal experience, grassroots have always been to work for people and you can't BS them. With this it is definitely going to occur.

Urban poor: I guess BPL is poor, protection from arbitrary eviction. You mean if they are living illegally? Won't that be rewarding illegal behavior? If its for legal housing, isn't it already illegal to remove someone from their own home? Shelters are a great idea, include Domestic violence victims as well for shelters. Right to housing isn't this Pradhan mantri avas yojna?

Agriculture law: NO Idea won't comment but I guess it is good.

NYAY yojna: Is it gauranteed 72000 or top up to 72000(you earn 50000, we add 22000)? What stops a poor person from depositing money and just say I lost a job? CASH transfer into a bank A/C of women of the family decide is it cash or account transfer. People can take cash out of bank accounts so terminology I guess. Maybe link this to adhar and make it like food stamps in USA?

GST 2.0: So bread and cigarett, cycle and mercedes will have same tax %? Bad idea.

Bank agglomoration: Actually happening right now many banks are merging. I'm not sure a good idea or bad but its already happening. Job losses possible or no new vacancy for long time with the current process, same in future if they wanna agglomorate more.

Science: Generally government in US produces a white paper every 10 years with experts in field with industrial giants on where the future is and funds are given to them. We need something of this sort. Include academics with industries.

Fisheries: Nice, depends on who is there and how it works however it will be in clash with waterways and road development as EPA is the same.

Internal security: How is terrorism and infiltration of terrorists (not millitants) not the same, what they upgrade from militants to terrorist when they kill people? Maoist/Naxalist are different from terrorist, how? Look up definition. Communal violence or riots are generally done in large groups pretty hard to know who did it, need infra and policy to indentify groups. Also make definition clear if a hindu has fight with muslim because of a parking spot, thats not communal violence.

CAPF: Don't bring politics in army, BJP is doing it and people are giving them flack for it. Once you do some kind of reservation, other options open up and then there will be cast analysis. JUST DON'T

Arts: How will you gaurantee freedom? Employer doesn't want you to do something but you do and get fired. Censorship is prerogative of the media e.g. movies have censor board. Vigilante groups are by default illegal (look up vigilante) and can be punished.

Anti Defection law: I know this is because of Amit Shah, its fine get the law.

Adhaar: Why not expand a prevalent system instead of restricting it. Parliament makes law, so make one.

Diversity Index: Don't. How will you enforce diversity in public companies. Don't we already have reservation? What would this achieve?

State-center: I call BS. Most of the states have BJP rule, congress will flip on this law. Delhi was supposed to be a state, what happened?

Remove minimum education for local bodies. Why? Regressive move.

Judiciary: Constitutional court is wrong, look at US court, they say companies are ""people"" and money is ""speech"" under constitution. Our courts are obsolete in how judges are selected and now this? It'd make them more powerful than parliament as you need 2/3rd majority to amend constitution. Basically giving court right to make a law from a vague law.

Defamation: Not sure.

Sedition: You can shout fire in crowded theatre but you'll be held responsible for the consequences.

AFSPA: I think army does this on its court, but will all cases be considered prima facie true? Where will the cases be prosecuted where it happened or the personel home state. Will he be in jail or suspended?

Media: Ever heard of oligopoly? US has anti monopoly law and there are ways to buy pass the system. Anyways now a days due to internet and mobile phones, media is not that prevalent.

Police reforms: Special wing, nice idea.

Niti Ayog: Changing names basically or wanna have advisary committee back again?

Reservation would be BS. Like in women or SC/ST reservation on seats, they'd just have their wife run the stuff like lalu did with rabdi.

Reservation in promotion: Why? Shouldn't people be judged based on their merit? Maybe use a random person to come and evaluate.

Citizen amendment bill: No surprise here

Minorities: Its already illegal to do hate crime, what is the use of more laws? Implement current one.

Healthcare: Basically what is going on.

Education: How do you plan to increase? Wage, facilities, new schools, universities. Many institutions do not spend what they are given, maybe have administors who are not stingy enough to spend stuff and teach them its not their money but governments?

NEET: Maths guy no idea whats the problem, maybe bio guys can tell.

Environment: Great, what do you plan to do about air pollution.

High speed internet affordable price. Who is going to provide? BSNL?

Right to privacy: Definitely need it but how will you enforce it? Twitter didn't come to parliament in India. Unless you get their data centers and servers in India, this is impossible.

Sorry for typos and If I'm wrong on anything, please feel free to correct me.

Didn't analyze BJP as they have copied their last one and put years at the back nothing new. Maybe will do later. Congress tightening the Anti-Defection law sounds like them trying to save their asses after they have seen so many people switch sides and leave. It is ominous and wrong. Their Agricultural policies on the other hand look promising and much more planned than BJP's.

Can someone explain to me why do they want to abolish Niti Aayog? I'm gonna say it. Congress' is better and more tangible, viable and stuff. BJP is rhetorical, seems last minute. Even though I don't support Congress, I am inclined to say that their manifesto is much better than BJP's. Now if they can project a capable PM candidate, someone who's not a Gandhi then I may consider voting for them. 
 Some very important and achievable things on Congress's manifesto. Specially Net Neutrality, Education and No fees for Gov't exams Congress is way forward.bjp still sticking to its old agenda.nothing was done for the past four years. Communal corrupt jumla v/s corrupt jumla 

I'll take plain corrupt over communal corrupt any day. In my opinion more assertion should be given on education reforms, promoting research and improving quality of higher education. To some extent Congress has thought over it but these points are not given much importance in BJPs manifesto. I like some points from BJP and some from Congress. Am I a centrist now? Whoa.  See the order points listed by BJP - the top ones are just about their core crooked values - the provocative topics which they always use to trigger religious fanaticism. I'm concerned how Congress is going to secure funds for NYAY and education spending bump. One of the articles in Quint did the math for 3L crore needed, it is viable only if existing subsidies like fertilizers, free power,Mengra etc gets stopped. After that also, we would need 1.3 L crore more, but congress said they will not be stopping any existing subsidies. If they stop other subsidies, then NYAY seems possible. If they come to power, they have to atleast give this to some families which after leakages due to corruption will not provide any benefits , full scale implementation is not possible. Their other plans looks good especially on the security plans.  \> **Citizenship Amendment Bill** \- Hindus, Jains, Buddhist and Sikhs escaping persecution from India's neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India.

&#x200B;

I dont get this!! Why based on religion? And in the same manifesto there is talk about uniform civil code What is the manifesto implementation rate? Did the BJP promise demonetisation in the last election?

These documents seem far removed from what governments actually do when in power. 

Ideally, we would vote based on a bullshit ratio of each government, some ratio of arbritrary words said to deeds implemented.

Congress/BJP are both capable of promising you the moon and then delivering you 1.3 billion 56"" spiked dildos to be mandatorily shoved up our 1.3 billion assholes. > * Education - We will take measures to dispense with the NEET examination.

Why? never ending topic >BJP's Menifesto for Muslim women: Ensuring equal rights - We will legislate a bill to prohibit and eliminate practices such as Triple Talaq and Nikah Halala.

Meanwhile BJP's members:

""When I ripped out foetus of a pregnant Muslim woman and put it on the tip of a sword,I felt like maharana pratap""

""Rally in support of rapist and murderers of 8 year old Asifa""

""Dead bodies of Muslim women should be dug out and raped""

""Gangrape & brutalise 5 month pregnant Bilqis Bano, left her for dead and smashes her 2yrs child head against a stone"" >Simulatenous elections - Wea re committed to the idea of simulatenous elections for Parliament, State assemblies and local bodies to reduce expenditure, ensure efficient utilisation of government resources and security forces and for effective policy planning.

Jumla party missed the opportunity to shoot real commitment to this item on the manifesto by refusing to conduct simultaneous elections in j&k. Sign of broken promises to come, in case anyone wonders about those after the 10 crore jobs they promised in the last manifesto turned out to be negative. >for withdrawing allegiance to the party or for supporting another party.

I don't know much about politics so i might be dead wrong but isn't this a ""you cant leave mahagadbandhan or there will be legal consequences"" law? LMAO

Combating Left Wing Extremism - We are committed to taking necessary and effective steps against left wing extremism to eliminate this menance in the next five years. interesting one. thanks for the effort.  

question: why didn't congress do these many things in their previous 10yrs of government?    

observation: there's a lot of freebies promises from both the sides. any word on how they plan to meet these extra expenditures? is it going to be the taxpaying middle class that'll bear the burden yet again ? [removed] Is it too much to ask. For alternate terms for each of them. Both have some good and some not so good points.
The real deal lies in the execution which neither of them would be able to do without a full majority without any alliances. Acche din again? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Congress manifesto talks of filling up all government jobs!

Isnt that worrying? Many government institutions are bloated as is. What is needed is to trim them and make them more efficient. >Application fees for government examinations and government posts will be abolished.

Why??

This is totally wrong. People will fill the form just for fun. Cost will rise exponentially for conducting exams. There is already lack of resources for online exams and f every tom, dick and harry fills the vaccancies I don't how that would work out. 

General/OBC candidates students have to pay a higher amount than SC/ST, it should be bought to same level instead. Am I the only one who read 'Sankalp Patra' as 'Sambit Patra' lmao ?????????? What is the percentage of female candidates in both Congress and BJP? Reservation for women is not priority for them it seems None of the party manifestos address the need for a revision of central investigation unit which functions purely on law and investigates government institutions without fear of reprisals. Also the need for an increase in the number of judges and installation of special courtrooms for smaller offences like drunk driving and small level thefts. Increasing reservation will only create more unequality, this will marginalize the working male class. BJP's manifestos deals with the idea of increasing free market and encourages businesses which will boost our economy and create jobs. NYAY is one of the stupidest ideas of Congress so far. They want to assign such a huge amount of money to people who are basically doing NOTHING. Instead of empowering them, Congress is working towards making them complacent towards their status as poor. This sends such a terrible message and example throughout the  country that its ok to not do anything, government will take care of everything. Well communists of the whole world thought that and look what happened to them, they have 100 million dead bodies to show that this idea doesn't work. Bjp has that stupid part about Ram Mandir again which is never going to happen, not unless we violate the constitutional ammendments. None of the party has anything regarding reforming education in India and promoting research and development. Overall the Congress manifesto is more lucretive though many points are almost impossible to achieve and some are downright nonsense. Bjp has a small manifesto but some clear stupid alt right leaning goals but India will profit more from their visions than Congress. Then again when have either of these parties done what was written in their manifestos. Once again, both the parties have made impressive manifestos. Even if they deliver on 1/3 of the promises made, India will be in a better place than it is today. The first thing before deciding whom to vote should be, to get to know who are the candidates. That individual is gonna promise the basic needs for your constituency and if not then please just don't send a puppet to the assembly, whom you can't find when you need him in your constituency.
Then comes the part where you think of a larger perspective i.e which party, for the power. That totally depends on the analysis that you do by yourself. Just see around what's happening and not just by following the puppet media.
I'm a first time voter and still waiting to know who all are gonna run from my constituency because the present one whenever comes to ground ends on participating in open mic. *sings song for us* You here didn't understand my point, what's NYAY scheme is and what the construction of statues are.
Construction which will never repay us that we know very well if we check the stats.
Now what I'm trying to tell you is this from an article published on:- https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/view-india-can-actually-benefit-from-nyay-but-conditions-apply/articleshow/68822001.cms

If 50 million families were to directly benefit, NYAY could cost $52 billion, or 2% of GDP (while currently existing consumer subsidy schemes are 3% of GDP).
Carefully just read the last line in brackets. I guess now you'll understand that actually this NYAY or UBI type module works in big countries, so we can also with help of great economist of the proud country work on scheme like this.
Also if you find time just try to go through BJP manifestos and then go to Congress you'll understand what clearly is vision and what are vague promises.

Happy that you actually send me the family survey. Kudos👍 is there a way to summarize this whole discussion? Could anyone tell me how much of the 2014 manifesto they accomplished? Is it worth believing in BJP at all? After seeing these 5 years I just feel despair to know that many of my class mates think BJP is actually good (Not saying Congress is good.) 
I really wish they change NOTA to actually mean something someday. So how much faith can I actually put in their manifestos? How much of the claims are actually delivered? How much can I expect? 'Left-wing extremism™' comprises of:

1. Opposition parties that ask questions of the ruling party 



2. Journalists exercising their professional and moral duty of reporting 'facts'



3. Writers and activists exercising their rights to speak their minds 



4. And basically anybody saying anything even *remotely* critical of the Supreme leader and his fascist, terroristic Hindutva ideology
 This is a high quality and much needed post. This should be here till the elections are ongoing. 

What the hell is wrong with BJP? Their manifesto is a precursor to India's bleak future. 

Someone please spread the word that there is more to this world than communal violence and divide. there goes the chance that i vote for congress.

&#x200B;

bjp it is! Congress's manifesto is thousand times better than BJP's one.

Congress's manifesto is pro-democracy while BJP is straight out want to end democracy, Simultaneous election is the biggest proof of it.

 Personally, I find that goals of the BJP manifesto are more attainable than that of the congress. Congress's goals to be implemented (keeping aside the rampant corruption that it displayed in the UPA regime) require a serious change in fiscal policies leading to unwarranted increases in tax liabilities across the middle income earners. My professional background as CA, LLB sees a point scored by the BJP strictly from the attainability standpoint. Sometimes, less is more.

Coming to the target audience, it's very clear what both parties are looking for. Like a broken record, BJP focuses on the ""right wing"" Hindu votes while congress prefers its ""minority"" vote bank (the Gandhi's literally appealed to the Muslim community to ask them not to vote for BJP).

So far my take is that BJP has an edge over the congress. I want a lot of what Congress is promising but I know it's not all gonna happen. Hell, I'd be surprised if they efficiently deliver on 5% of the promised stuff. The only thing I don't agree with on Congress' manifesto is  reservation in promotion posts for SCs, STs and OBCs. Just no. That was not what was decided post-independence. Quotas and reservations were meant to continue for a short term to bring the SC, ST, OBCs upto speed. All reservations must be removed with immediate effect so everyone gets a fair chance. The general category has been languishing as far as jobs are concerned, for decades now.

Speaking of which, one important thing to note is that no party's manifesto has openly promised creating jobs for people. That's the most important issue right now, at least for lakhs of youngsters across the country. Disappointed that neither of them didn't even bother to mention it. BJP still has to depend on Ram Mandir for votes. India comprises diverse cultures and traditions. It's a composite of religions and tribes. It's not easy to bring a uniform civil code for all. BJP is just using them as a tool to win votes. 
 Repealing Article 370 is not the solution to Kashmir issue. It should be dealt through integrating Kashmiris with the mainstream Indian culture. Sure it takes time. Mere military measures will further worsen the situation. 
BJP feeds on Hindu emotions and exploit them. Looks like BJP is serious about the Kashmir issue. If they really have the balls to abolish 370, maybe they should be given a chance. But it looks like a far cry in the light of recent statements given by Mehbooba Mufti. I cannot  take congress seriously when  once again they are propping up the idiot  Rahul and now even his sister has joined in,they should realize that Gandhi family has screwed over the majority of  people in India  (multiple times) too,many of them will vote for BJP even though they know they are not right for the country. I feel the Congress manifesto to be a lollipop.

They want to give ₹72,000 to each poor person every year, the burden of this would be on the tax payer. 

Also, they had 60 years to fullfill their promises, why have they waited so long? 

 Jumla patra Conspicuous by its absence: Cow protection and black money! But tell me how many Governments have lived up to their manifesto?? These are cheap baits and nothing else. Idk if someone has pointed it out yet, but - 

Congress manifesto says - 

a) we'll provide RS. 72,000 / family to the bottom 20% every year

b) we'll have a single, ""moderate"" GST

There are only 2 possibilities - 

1) they'll increase income tax or bring up a new tax

2) they won't fulfill their promise

EDIT: 3) increase fuel prices

Of which, one is a well, and the others - ditch. That ram mandir thing in bjp manifesto. India is a secular country you can’t just do that . Just leave the land . It won’t effect anyone’s belief if there is one less mandir. Mandir jo banayega, vote wohi payega. Hijacking this thread to ask a question...

So... I don't have my voter's card yet, how do I apply and get it in time?

I was to get it made, but recently we shifted homes so our address proof has to be changed, so what will I show as my address proof?

Plus I have moved out of my house for my first job, living in a PG...

Kindly do suggest the best course of action, I have to vote... probably better to discuss how much work was done by both parties from previous manifesto Sab Lamba Lamba fek Raha hai. Neither will do anything and make it even worse Why aren't we getting some young whippersnappers instead of these same old ones ? Am I missing something? I don't see any point in the INC manifesto about urban mobility or mobility in general? 

Moreover, I don't think it's possible to avoid that point since it's being shown that improving public transit systems increase the economic growth of the country.

Another point, I see a few changes taking place in Bangalore with regards to this. For example, they have started to regulate and make available licences for bicycle sharing companies. They have also started building up the infrastructure, though it's taking some time. Congress states that there are vacancy for jobs then what's the problem with bjp to fill them up. Criticism over job would be over. Thanks for this. I’m actually scared to visit the sites of these parties for fear of those pesky web cookies. What a cluster fuck. The scariest and most worrisome part about this for is the anti defection law. What is manifesto.. Sorry I am just not aware Eliminating TB by 2025? Oof that's quite the promise. Just this week we studied three recent TB cases in our college. How much of what the BJP promised last time has been upheld? ""BJP Manifesto doesn't allow to copy text (even though it is a PDF document)."" 

I can copy it. Where is my ₹15 lakh promised by Modi? If note ban is so successful, from where these currency notes worth crore of rupees are coming for distribution to voters? Why the hell is the Ram Mandir in the manifesto? Can a party looking to form a government promise construction of religious stuff? Isn't that against the model code of conduct? Both the Manifestos look so *perfect* but the elected government will forget their promises within a month. I kinda see the manifestos being split across, BJP going pro-business, Congress going pro-human / society.

Wonder if   
>Digital Rights - Uphold the principle of net neutrality.  

Includes porn. Are people taking these manifestos seriously? Please just check out your local candidate and decide if they seem like people who are honest and can deliver. These manifestos are just propaganda stuff compiled by people who don't even stand for the elections. The problem is not the contents of the manifestos but whether they can deliver that. 
The past government does not have any credible track record, so it doesn't matter if they promise moon and stars. The need for minimum income guarantee scheme is and direct indication of failure of previous government at economic empowerment of people of country. The poor conditions of roads across the country is another such indication. Unavailability of uninterrupted electricity after a government being so long in power does not inspire any credibility.
I like the track record of the current government. This government has rolled out various schemes successfully. The schemes have gone through design and implementation phase pretty fast. Now I do agree that these schemes haven't reached everyone but on the other end expecting them to reach 1.2 bn people in time of mere less than 5 years is very unfair. \>Uniform Civil Code

\>  Sabrimala: We will undertake every effort to ensure that the subject of faith, tradition and worship rituals related to Sabarimala are presented in a comprehensive manner before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. We will endeavour to secure constitutional protection on issues related to faith and belief.

A lot of people say that they don't feel anything bad about not having a father. That their mom is their father and mother at the same time. I love my mom. There can be no doubt about that. I'm.also aware of how my much she loves me and all the sacrifices she has made for me.

But still I miss my dad. Or I should say a father figure. I can't say this to my mom because she is really sensitive and can start crying over literally anything.

Last Wednesday I went to one of my mom's friends home. Her son is 5 years old. When his father came back home (he is a doctor) he started playing with him. It kind of hurt so bad seeing them, remembering that I never got to play with my dad when I was 5, or in any age. My parents are forcing me to leave my job and get married. Why do parents behave like this.  
All my life, they told me to work hard and aim to achieve great things. But now since I am 24 they want me forget all about that and get married. 
They even had the audacity to tell me they made a mistake letting me study. I am really disappointed in them. I always thought my parents were better than that. My question is pretty common. How to move on? 
I dated a 4 years girl ago and it lasted for 2 years. It was a long distance relationship. She was unhappy so she wanted to brake up due to constant fights. I also thought it was better to leave her back then but after a month of breakup I started feeling miserable. This continued till a year. Even after 2.5 years of breakup I still miss her. But let's leave that part.

Now coming to main point, due to my miserable life after breakup I many times decided to never to talk to her. Initially in the first year after breakup, she messaged me rarely but after that the frequency increased and now it's like every 3 days. I tried telling her many times, that her messaging me is not healthy for me, I don't feel mentally stable because the thought of her causes intense mood swings in me. But she replies each time that she just wants to be my friend and help me through this phase. 

I even shouted and screamed at her multiple times, just to tell her to stay away from me and not contact me due to my mental issues. I tried blocking her many times, deleted her number but she reaches me anyway and since I always has a soft spot for her, I unblocked her every time and had to talk to her.

She just asks general questions- how are you, how's college going etc. It's not like she manipulates me, she just doesn't understand that we cannot be friends because I will always have feelings for her but she would never. What should I do? 

Also She is dating her 1st bf again (I was her 2nd) and the thought of it also makes me mad. So tomorrow is my Mom's birthday and my ""father"" already gave her a birthday present two days ago. 

He said he wishes her birthday becomes her deathday and it would be nice if she gets her head cut off in a train track. 

This is one the worst thing he has ever done and that includes him trying to murder her 2 years ago with a scissor.  

Hopefully by end of next year i can get my chamber running well enough so that i can get a loan for half the money i need for me and mom's new flat [she will pay the other half directly].

Problem is, the motherfucker is pretty well politically connected to the ruling party [was a big student leader and is a big enough name in his academic line]. [deleted] I am 28 (male) and my mother died(suicide) when I was 8 moths old. My father remarried with my aunt's sister. I stayed with my maternal grand parents(nana-nani) till 17. I came back to my father and started living with him. It's been 11 years since then only he cares about money. 2 years back I stopped giving him money, He told me to live separately and Now I live in a different state. He never calls or ask how I am. I recently visited him on a festival and he just again did the same thing, talked with me in anger and said me to never go to him and he will give everything to his daughters. I was only child from my mothers and I have three step sisters from this mom. and This mom is a villainous woman for me. I don't know what should I do? I will net get married as Indian society looks for groom's background and family, and my family has abandoned me I'm in a really sticky situation. 
***
I'm 20M and currently an Engineering student. I'm in a sordid state of affairs because of my strict parents. As surprising it might be, I've zero social life(my daily routine consists of going from Home to College),and even in that process I need to inform my parents about my whereabouts. Any delay in informing,and they'll ring up my Profs,my HoD & my friends!

No partying with friends,no dine-outs and a strict curfew time(as if I've ventured out someday!).

Compounding this situation,is that... I'm in a relationship. Because of my parents,even taking my girlfriend out on a date becomes stressful for me, I've to create alibis for myself.

Couple of months ago, they guessed I was in a relationship,and I had to spill the beans. As expected,they turned from ""liberal"" parents to completely Super Saiyan mode, telling me to break-off the relationship with this 'random girl'. Of course, I didn't.

Now,even talking to her on phone gets tough,because my mother is forever snooping. Earlier,my grades weren't really good,but I'm getting better now. Yet they blame the relationship and the subsequent lack of grades,lack of good behaviour,lack of respect for them,lack of familial values.

While I see my friends partying,getting on get-togethers,taking their gals on a date, I'm not even able to convince my parents for a movie with my friends (they suspect, there'll be girls- susheel Sanskari beta bigad jayega )

Even my expenses are limited,spend more than 100/- per week on anything other than conveyance,and they'll say-""stop taking random girls on dates, they'll yield nothing.""

I'm tired and I'm sick of fighting this battle in my head. Sometimes,me and my girlfriend fight due to these issues(her family is quite liberal,tho) and then, I feel like an absolute piece of ... you know what.

Yesterday,my Mom caught me talking with her and raised an issue. She said that we're persuing a ""faltu""(worthless) relationship. My girlfriend heard it and was furious. I can understand it,anyone will be. Her ego and honour was hurt. 

She was aghast that I didn't do much, except for giving my Mom the silent treatment. We're nearly on the verge of breakup as she says,her emotional needs aren't met. Yet, I don't want to break up with her. I just can't.

Now, I'm living off my Dad's money,and I can't even rebel and stand up for myself.

Any advice?

TL;DR: 20M, Parents controlling every aspect of my life. Feeling messed up from within.

Edit1: Thanks everybody for your advice. it really matters to me a lot. Relationship advice

Hi I am 23 year old Mechanical engineer working in software MNC. All my life I never have been in relationships. I would be lying if I say I am not craving for relationship, sex and other stuff.

Recently, I started dating a girl. I really like her. But after some free lunches, she has started behaving weird. She said she could not be in relationship with me coz of her parents. She says she loves me but she can't be with me. Over a period of time she has become dry, absolute dry. No emotions at all.
I am still pursuing her. Part of me thinks that I really love her and other part of thinks that I only want physical relationship from her and that's why I want to be with her. 

What should I do now?

P.S.- sorry for any grammatical mistakes Using a throwaway for this.

I (35M) was in a relationship with this girl about 2.5 years ago. I loved her with all my heart. Like she was the one and all that jazz.

&#x200B;

She claimed that her ex was abusive and used to beat her and force himself on her, and that she broke it off with him just before she her marriage. They had been together for 7 years before she met me. Listening to that made my blood boil, but I didn't care. She was with me and I would never do anything to hurt her.

&#x200B;

About 3-4 months before she broke up with me, her ex started calling her continuously, and in spite of me requesting her to block him, she continued talking to him. She would always compare me to him, and keep reminiscing about the time when she was with him. It hurt like sin listening to it, but I loved her and I never said a word.

&#x200B;

Eventually, she broke up with me to be with him. I sent that bastard a ""congratulations"" text, telling him about how she had broken up with me.

&#x200B;

He dumped her.

&#x200B;

She blamed me for him dumping her. Railed on me about how I wasn't a man. That he was the love of her life, and how I destroyed her life.

&#x200B;

It's been 2.5 years now. I still don't have the confidence to commit to anyone. Whenever any girl I start talking to on dating apps starts getting close to me, I push them away by acting like a jerk or ghosting them.

&#x200B;

I really want to hold someone close to me, to feel the warmth of her skin close to mine. But I can't. I'm a Software Engineer living in Bangalore, originally from a tier 3 City of Gujarat.

  


**Sometimes** I badly miss my family (3 kids (niece, nephew) + mummy mainly). **Not always.** I **loved** livingBangalore most of the time (Nice city, people, places, culture, etc).

  


I'm a little confused professionally. I want at least one big known software company on my resume.

  


I want to know other people's opinion on what are benefits and disadvantage of

1. Getting a job in a big known software company and living in Bangalore.

2. Getting a remote job and living back to my native place. My family forced me to go for MS of all places - australia and leave my job in Bangalore. I am not at all comfortable with the decision and not very comfortable living in a new place. Dear counselors,

I need advice on a case of acquitenance. 

One of my cousin brother committed Suicide due to the mental torture from  wife.

He was married from past 4 years and had 2-3 year old baby boy.

His wife was staying with their own parents most of the time.

These two brothers were married to two real sisters and another sister is also having same issue and having a baby boy and she had given full support to her younger sister in this whole case.

Could you please suggest me what can we do here. Both legally and logically.

I'm just thinking aloud here if this girl did this, entire family of this boy would have been put in jail and their life would have been hell.

Thanks. Thank you folks for this. I tried to post about my problems in the relationship_advice and stopped after realizing that it will take a hell lot of time to explain the Indian family structure before I could actually ask something. My date didn't yet to talk me about second date. What to do? Should I call her? i don't know if it's off the topic but any group online where inter-religion couples can exchange views",2019-07-21 14:26:22

Scheduled,Sewage workers in India,33,d5hiim,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d5hiim/sewage_workers_in_india/,12,"Sewage workers in India suffer from the worst work-environment and we are doing nothing about it. They literally take a dip inside the sewage tanks filled with shit or sewage water to clean the clogged up drains and many die due to the poisonous gas build up inside those tanks. What kind of human would do it to themselves? Believe me, they don't. They drink a lot before and after to avoid the trauma of working in such conditions. And that takes a toll on their financial condition(which is already low) and their family. So, what's the solution? 

There should be a law which prevents man-power to clean sewage drains and tanks. But that's already there in the law! Then what's the hurdle? There's a lack of safety equipments and technical equipments to clean the drains without a man entering the manholes. They do it because there's no other way to do it. And people expect them to do it because almost all sewage workers belong to the scheduled caste. These casteist feelings are present everywhere which alienates their voice for a reform in the system. 

In my opinion, Indian government must spend money on buying advanced sewage equipments and safety equipments and masks. And they should be present in every municipality office, for free. Government should also conduct training programs to teach the sewage workers on how to use those equipments effectively. And the final step is that of citizens, to stop looking at them as the ""untouchables"" and appreciate them as human beings who clean up your shit, so that you don't have to. 

What are your opinions to solve the problem? Kindly give your opinions in the comments",boss_bj," I have a doubt. If this is a job no one wants to do ,shouldn't the wage be high? I'm glad that you wrote this post. I did a study on deaths of sewerage workers in the first year of my masters and it was enlightening.

I interviewed a dozen of veteran sewerage workers in 2018, a year before there were numerous deaths of labourers going inside a manhole and suffocating to death.

All the workers i interviewed were very experienced and employed by DJB. Those people who die and become a piece of news are young desperate sewerage contractual workers hired by the contractors who were given contracts by DJB. This way the government is able to shield itself from any direct responsibility from the death of these contract workers. These workers are not experienced, have no knowledge of deadly gasious combination inside a manhole, proper training and equipment. These men do this because they are desperate to earn a living but thankfully it's changing and i can only say for Delhi, it's being mechanised and although there are still loopholes, nobody goes inside a manhole until absolutely necessary. We still have a long way to go in mechanising the entire process for all galis and bylanes of delhi.


Cast factor also plays a major role and we can see institutionalised castism being practiced as vast majority of sewerage workers are SC/ST.

Edit: Also, this is a very dangerous job because of its health hazards. Almost everyone i interviewed said that they were suffering from eye problems or breathing difficulty due to them used to being multiple hours inside sewerage and drains which included things like used syringes, sanitary napkins etc. One veteran said that in earlier days, people used to drink hard liquor and get themselves intoxicated so that they could bear the smell before entering the manhole. This practice alone lead to so many problems like alcoholism, domestic problems and health issues. How about standardizing the sewage drains and tanks so that we can use some kind of automated mass produced machinery to do the job in most cases instead of having people all the way?",2019-09-17 22:08:24

This thread is just in time for what I had on my mind the whole day. 

**How do you deal with the reality of your parents getting older?**

Yesterday evening I saw my father come back home and just wind down as he usually does. And for the first time, seeing him made me feel this dread in the air... He's growing old... No... He IS old. I could see the toll time has taken on him. Wish I had better words to describe my thoughts. 

Now I know this didn't happen overnight and yesterday wasn't any different than any other day in past few months/years. But I felt this helpless fear seeing this man who carried the weight of a family so well for decades, now labouring to push through another day. 

Folks, how do/did you deal with this? Is there anyone belonging to no-hugs family here? i.e. one where no one ever hugs someone else in the family. I wish my folks just got divorced. I know, life would have been very different (maybe worse) if that happened, but at least I wouldn't be so socially fucked up as a grown adult. From age 10, all I can remember is my parents not even talking to each other. My dad is a piece of shit, fine. My mom struggled a lot to give me and my brother a better life, which I really appreciate. But honestly, in retrospect, I feel a divorce would have been better than all of us just living in one house like a bunch of roommates who just talk to each other about things like dinner is ready, should I switch off the lights, etc.

Even today, I cannot understand how a normal family functions. I mean, I cannot process it. When my friends say they are just going to the park with their parents or going on a holiday with their family, I cannot understand it. I cannot process a bunch of people in a family sitting around a table and just talking about their day and shit.

If I ever have kids, I am going to make sure they don't suffer as I did. Seriously. Would-be parents who are reading this, if you start hating each other, just get a divorce and move on. It has lasting effects on the child. How many of you have lost perfectly normal loving uncles , aunts , parents , cousins due to radicalisation by hate messages , fake news on WhatsApp , Shit news ? 

How do you handle them ? How to handle family occasion ? Is there a hope ? Your thoughts on arranged marriages? I dread the prospect of marrying a stranger, someone whom I'll never be able to love. I am a 34 year old man and all of a sudden missing friendship with my guy friends. All my friends have gotten married, moved abroad or just decided not to be my friend for religious reasons. I do not have a guy friend who I can talk to one on one or just ask out for a movie or a drink. 

I am still in touch with my female friends and speak to them once in a while but when it comes to guys, I don't have anyone in India I could call a friend. [deleted] any stories of overprotective/helicopter parents?  

Hi all, Did not think my first post in 8 years will be for relationship support. I will try to keep it as short as possible. 

  
I  am 29 year old male who joined a bank 2 yrs ago after completing MBA.  When i joined my father had passed away just 3 months back and i being  the eldest sibling wanted to marry and settle down as soon as possible  to  take over responsibilities of my family. Among other people another  girl aged 25 right now also joined with me at Delhi location. I liked  her from the beginning and after being friends with her and pursuing  relationship with her for 2-4 months, she finally said yes to me in last  may. Although she said yes i always felt that she was not really sure  about me(she sometimes also said it outright) and i thought with time  she will like me more and this feeling will go away.

  
In  Sep last year, she moved to Hyderabad to work for an FMCG company and  we decided to try long distance. Till Jan this everything was okay. I  would visit her and then she visited me as well. We sometimes had fights  over communication problems but then would talk sense into each other  and moved forward. Jan was the last time i visited her. Once i got back i  got stressed out due to multiple family problems which i wont get into  and in addition that nagging feeling that she was not really sure, i  decided to end it and called her. We discussed it a lot and then decided  to end our relationship in Feb end... As soon as i did it, i realized i  made a mistake but i didnot call her back because i was the one  proposed to end it but lo and behold after 20 days she says she is in  delhi and wants to meet me... We met and decided to give it one more  try. 

  
Now from March to May end we had good moments  and bad moments but according to me these were normal communication  issues of long distance...i told her to come to Hyderabad but she would  make excuses and all. On May 28 i called her and she was not showing a  lot of interest for last 3-4 days, so i told her to call when she wanted  to talk and hung up. 15 days passed and no call. Ultimately i called  her and asked she was behaving like we were done with each other and she  said yes we are done and hung up...it was so shocking that i got so  angry that i also decided to end it...however after 15 more days i  called her and told her if we are going to end it, we should end it on a  good note and wished her best of luck for her future and she did the  same.  
At this point of  time, it was july 1 and i thought we were not made for each other. But i  started missing her a lot and atlast messaged her on july 20 that i  wanted to meet to discuss and wanted to get back together. She remained  very adamant she had 0 interest in me now, had moved on and i should  also do so. But i kept poking her and atlast she told me that she had  gone on trip with her MBA friends in Jan this year and had started  developing feeling for another guy who was in 2017 batch of her MBA  college. She tried to supress those feelings and tried to be with me but  couldn't do so and when we stopped talking on may 28, decided that we  were done and now wanted to move forward. This guy from her college is  in same company in chandigarh, earns better, has good career prospects  than me and they ofcourse have more common friends.  
Now  i did some more digging and found that she had come to delhi to go to  mcloedganj with this guy on may 31 without telling me...just 3 days  after she stopped talking to me... ofcourse they would have planned it  while while she was all lovey dovey with me( she says they went in a  group although i dont trust her since there were no pics on any social  media). I confronted her and now she has blocked me on fb, insta,  whatsapp everywhere. Also all this confrontation happened only on  messaged and she never picked my call and refused to meet me.  
2.5  years have passed since i joined my company...my career is going  nowhere...i sidelined my family responsibilities for her....i am now a  grey haired balding fat slob who still has strong feelings for a girl  and still wants to be with her after getting cheated on. All my friends  say i should have seen it coming or i should have committed more time to  her. Cherry on the cake was she asked to tell about us to noone...so  none of our common friends knew about us till last week ....and now she is telling  everyone that she always told me that she was not sure about me and  tried with me but it did not work out  
I dont really know where to go from here. I miss her and still pathetically in love with her I am having a hard time with my boyfriend. 

When we met, he was a virgin and I had a promiscuous past. We fell in love. For the sake of honesty, I told him about my past but not all. Just told him that I had two exs. He accepted it and it was all good. 

One day, he snooped through my Facebook and dug his way through every single flirt/crush/whatever of my past. 

That day, he lost all respect and love for me and has been treating me with as much respect as you would a hooker. 

The thing is according to me, it was my past and I hid it because he wouldn't understand. His reaction proved me right. 

He thinks I hid those things because I was stringing him along. 

We both tried to breakup several times but it didn't happen. We work together. We live together. :/

Now, our parents are searching for venues for marriage. And we are so broken. 

I asked him to go to a counselor together. But he has sworn that he wouldn't tell anyone about my past to protect my integrity. He keeps it all in and it's killing him and killing us. 

He treats me so shitty every single day and it's so fucked up that I can't leave because both of us are in hard-earned govt jobs. 

Please help. r/IndianRelationships is a good place for this. [deleted]",2019-07-29 00:09:45

My official trip was cut from 16 to 6 days. I made all the plans and now I am just sitting here applying for other jobs.

Never had I been so desperate to pass. Exam was fine. I have a 70-80% chance of passing. Fuck this subject.  This masturbation addiction is really killing me! I can't remember shit, always sleeping and becoming more lazy, getting mouth ulcers, thin hair.

**Atrocities against dalits increasing in Kerala: Scheduled Castes Commission** 

 ______ 
National Commission for Scheduled Castes said on Saturday atrocities against dalits were increasing in Kerala and the state government has failed to ensure them adequate safety. L Murugan, Vice Chairman of the Commission said here that the agency has been receiving lots of complaints of atrocities especially against dalit women and also regarding the diversion of SC funds for other purposes.

He was in the city after visiting SC colonies in Govindapuram village in Palakkad district, where dalit residents had been reportedly suffering from untouchability and some villages in Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam district. “According to the figures of the Crime Records Bureau, as many as 883 cases of atrocities have been reported against Scheduled Caste people in the state during the period between June 2016 to April 2017,” he told reporters in Thiruvananthapuram.

“Of them, 12 were murder cases and 155 were rape. The state government has failed to ensure dalits especially SC women protection. The state government should take necessary steps to ensure protection for SC people,” he said. Lack of timely action by the government may lead to instill insecurity in the minds of dalit people, he said. Murugan also asked the state government to ensure basic amenities in dalit colonies across the state.

“The condition of SC colonies in the state is very worse. I visited some of such places including the Ambedkar colony in Govindapuram and similar ones in Muvattupuzha,” he said. Basic amenities including proper housing and drinking water are lacking in SC colonies, he said adding that there was not even buriel grounds to cremate dalits in many places.

[Bipul Chettri - Asaar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNoGXzEL1mA)

Also, he will be performing in NH7 at the Delhi & Pune editions next month. Here goes another one by Ragasur: [Sadiyon Ka Pyaar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSEuEpWZ4Vw) [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvgo53BBR2U) is a haryanvi ragni (folk music from haryana). Telling Shiva's story. It was used in the movie Oye Lucky Lucky Oye. So /u/jmjjohn has asked me to post some regional music. I am from haryana, so I'll stick to haryanvi music.

An interesting scenario is going on in Haryana. Folks songs, as I've listened them from gathering of elder ladies here during occasions like marriage, death(yes we celebrated death of elder people here, women sing and dance on folk songs), are meeting technology now. Singers are producing folk music in a new way(mostly auto tunes though). Here a few folk songs(excuse cringe inviting videos):


1. [Kothe Chad Lalkaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0L0-jVwDoQ): A well know folk song here. It's about a woman asking her husband to buy her [damaan](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gYjMqP5_e_Q/U3IZoDBvT-I/AAAAAAAAA2A/KgK3-2TITkI/s1600/10256511_533110906801043_4517490494917535231_n.jpg) (she is holding it in her hands). Part sung by male singer is never a part of these songs( these songs are sung by women, men have 'raagni', though women still sing in raagnis), that's why there are many versions of this song.

2. [Paltan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw8-W-P16e0): Woman asking her husband to buy her a damaan before he goes to 'platan' (a group in the army, like Rajputana Rifles). Same as above, part sung by male varies, there are many versions of this song too. She also complains about how every woman in the family teases her about him going to army posting.

3. [Jeth Mera Das Padh Raheya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emd0-JBK79Q) Woman complaints how her husband is illiterate and how his elder brother(jeth) is 10th pass while his younger brother(devar) is BA pass. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55MfeCkAnw4) is a group of women singing it. That's how women gather and sing and dance on occasions here.

Will add more later.
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5ZJcFx_eiE) is a documentary type video if you are interested, checkout folk song in the beginning, there's translation too. [Maula - Vasuda Sharma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97p4okjopS8)

**India’s first underwater rail tunnel completed ahead of schedule** 

 ______ 
The deadline was July this year. But the engineers and employees of Afcons Transtonnelstroy and Kolkata Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation Ltd, the two entities implementing the East West Metro have completed boring the country’s first tunnel under the Hooghly river for establishing metro link between Howrah and Kolkata.

Rachna, a giant tunnel-boring machine (TBM), was deployed to dig the underwater tunnel that runs a length of 502 metres under the river.

Afcons Transtonnelstroy is an Indo-Russian joint venture. The machine was brought from Herrenknecht AG plant in Schwanau in Germany.

Work of the tunnel is progressing satisfactorily claims the authorities.

The entire project is 16.6 km long, out of which 10.8 km runs under the ground. Of this 10.8 km, 502 metres is under the water. The project connects Howrah to the west and Salt lake to the east.

Digging this tunnel was the most difficult and critical task in the entire project. The job was completed in a time of one month and six days, about 50 days ahead of schedule. The project is built by Afcons Transtonnelstroy and implemented by KMRCL.

A senior official of KMRCL, who did not wish to be named, said that the work digging the tunnel started on April 14, 2016. “The entire credit for completion of the work much before scheduled deadline goes to the 250 odd engineers, technicians and workers, who have worked day and night to complete the task. On an average we have dug 35 to 40 metres every day, following which the digging of the entire tunnel length of 520 metres was completed in little more than a month,” the KMRCL officer said.

The stretch of 16.6 km will have 12 stations, six of which will be under the ground, while the remaining six stations will be on elevated tracks. The final commissioning of the project commissioning of the project is expected by December 2019, following which it will be operational.

“Considering the pace at which we completed the most difficult task of creating the underwater tunnel, we hope to meet the deadline of final commissioning,” the KMRCL official said.

The total project cost is $750 million, which roughly comes to around Rs 5,000 crores. Since the beginning, the project was held up several times mainly due to land allocation, slum relocation and route alignment problems among others.

The project was originally slated to be completed by 2012. It was first postponed to 2015 and finally to December 2019.

Mast mausam.hai bc Watching Daredevil S02 on Netflix. [deleted] Went to watch Eye In The Sky. Liked the movie, but it makes me wonder if the producers missed a trick by allowing the audience to make the final decision on whether or not to order the drone strike, especially when the build up was the circumstances surrounding it. 

It would be interesting to find out the audience's decision in this case and to see if any interesting data comes out of it.
