Koko , kabbadi, hopping Sakli This just got me thinking we are going to raise a new generation which does not know what gilli danda is....... We used to play a game, I don't remember it's name but it was basically tag but played in a certain boundary. I will try to draw the boundary line maybe someone who has played it remembers it. It's a team sport and can be played by any number of players above 4. Basic version was 2v2, then 3v3 and so on. 

I have drawn a 3v3, the players 1,2 and 3 have to stop the other team players that are drawn as circles to reach the other end of the rectangle and back to start. The players 1,2,3 can only move in the direction that's mentioned and cannot go further than the drawn arrow. Basically it's like kabaddi, where you have to tag the player of the opposite team and take him out and lock them inside the smaller squares to stop their movement. 

We used to lots of power cuts back in 1997-2000 in summers so we would play it at night till 12 on the road or in the park.[https://i.imgur.com/MoSHXFh.png](https://i.imgur.com/MoSHXFh.png) Football?",2020-03-19 15:12:45

Sports,Pleasantly surprised with the amount of sports Hotstar is making available.,135,dvrc4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dvrc4w/pleasantly_surprised_with_the_amount_of_sports/,35,"Hotstar is currently streaming U17 Women's Football Tigresses vs Panthers match. Why it's surprising that this match is being streamed:

* It's not cricket. Non-cricket sports have generally not been broadcast unless super important
* It's women's game. Great to see women's matches being broadcast.
* It's U17. It's not even the top level side.
* It's a domestic match. It's not some FIFA WC Qualifier.

Other than that, more domestic cricket matches are being streamed now. Today a few SMA trophy matches were streamed and an U19 match vs Nepal was streamed.

Hockey Olympic qualifiers were also streamed, for both men and women.

Pro Kabaddi has obviously had a lot of success too.

I don't follow other sports much, but a few badminton opens were also streamed AFAIK.",SreesanthTakesIt," Hotstar VIP is such a value of money. They always mess up the telecast via dish tv like how showing cricket in all star sports channels. Hotstar even telecasts esports. That's how deep they go. The quality is shit sometimes, but I can live with it. 

Now, if they could get AEW on their channel, literally everything I watch will be on Hotstar. I watched all of CWC and IPL on HotStar. My subscription money has been earned back easily Don’t forget the f1. Though the coverage is not comprehensive, like they don’t telecast fp1-2-3. But still a place to watch the qualifiers and race. The only issue I have with Hotstar is that their sports streaming quality is so bad! Low bitrate and an awful player ; I tend to find other streams even though I subscribe to Hotstar. Yes it's really good with the different kind of sports it's making available. Badminton coverage has been excellent.

Wonder how much the media rights for a U-17 women's football were acquired for (maybe free, it has only 4 teams). It's being organized by FSDL which is a Reliance subsidiary. For a newly launched event getting listed on streaming sites like hotstar and jio would be a boon. They stream F1. <3 Does it work with Chromecast? To the football fans, Hotstar is definitely a treat, up along with Jio TV which also shows some not so top level matches .

And even *Full Replays*…!! 

Its so amazing.

If I miss a match somehow due to timing etc, I can just see  the Replay 

Plus all the HBO shows!

It's definitely better than Prime or slightly better at the same price range

The only downside being its data consumption being too high, higher than Netflix and Prime Video. Where can I watch wrc races? I took the vip subscription just to watch ISL. Its definitely worth the money and also you can watch multiple sporting events. Hoping that the upcoming Olympics will also be streamed. Who here watches Women's football and what makes it interesting? I tried watching the world cup game; was boring so I'm interested in knowing if it's worth watching again. If yes, please suggest matches/teams/leagues. Now its even streaming endgame in hindi , and is all set to get most of the disney plus content , along with most having localisation in indian languages , netflix will have to DRIVE ahead fast , tailgating PrimeVideo to actually compete with them in india. Yeah hotstar has been a great boon for the neglected sports in India. 

Plus the fact that they have shows like Chernobyl make the deal even more worth it. I wish they stream chess. How to watch hotstar from outside India anyone know [deleted] I feel hotstar vip / premium at 1000 Rs for a month is very much value for Money.",2019-11-13 20:53:25

Tanning is not a problem but hyperpigmentation is and sun exposure leads to hyperpigmentation in some individuals like pigmentation around the eyes, freckles, mouth etc . Also sun is very harmful for our skin .So I would recommend do not go out in the sun especially girls because female skin is more prone to hyperpigmentation and sun damage . And it is very difficult to treat hyperpigmentation of indian and black skin tones. If your parents advised you to not go in the sun at an early age for whatever reason indirectly they did a favour to you . But if you still want uneven skin tone then that's your choice. And do you guys think sania mirza never went to a dermatologist for skin treatments ? I can tell by looking at quality of her skin that she did had treatments. And all of these treatments make your skin fairer then it was before treatment , although not fair then your natural complexion.",2019-10-07 17:42:17

It was a beautiful track. But an expensive sport like F1 isn't designed for India. Even Azerbaijan and Mexico struggle despite drawing good crowds. Maybe a few years down the line. Although I don't see F1 surviving the end of conventional fuel era for that long. ""GP2 government... GP2 government. Aaargh!"" This track and other mega infrastructure projects like it are a testament to our quashed hopes and dreams as a nation. When I graduated from school in 2006, we all really did think that India would be a great and prosperous nation in 20 years.

I don’t know why I am posting this.. Guess, I am just tired of getting rejected...

I’ve started feeling that I should quit and start doing something new. But the thing is... I’ve never thought of any other profession. Being a journalist made me happy, but lately I’ve started feeling that I am just not meant for it...

P.S. [edit] I did work for several brands, but during my last job tenure I ended term with some animosities with the employers. Also, it feels like I am venting here while typing the issue. Nonetheless, it’s a pickle.",Pscyked," You have everything you need right there with you, just look around, start writing the stories you always wanted to write, there is a whole wide world of social media options to choose from on how to broadcast what you write to everyone out there. If your stories resonate with your audience, definitely you will be able to better target your stories and start monetising your talent. All the best. Why are you unable to get a job? What's missing? Hey you could open your channel and let the viewers donate. Many people are doing this independent journalism. Like Faye D Souza who just opened her channel after being fired(or she just quit?). Look for these channels as well Kumar Shyam, Aam Press Tv. Get you own channel Try newslaundry I’m no expert, but maybe try writing your own articles, opinion pieces etc. and use free platforms like YouTube n such. Or offer them to local newspapers and magazines. Once you’ve got sufficient ‘by lines’ you could apply to bigger publications. There is a great dearth of good, well researched and independent journalists in India. Most of them now are pushing some agenda or ideology. Print journalism may still have some integrity but electronic media is a cesspool. Before even switching on the television, most of us can predict the spin each channel will put on a certain event. 

Journalists are much needed for this country. The battlefield of the 21nd Century is going to be information and attention with you people being the force multipliers of the arena. Though you are struggling now and have stumbled, don't falter.  Good luck OP! Find your niche and everything shall follow. Do not feel disappointed. Try getting in touch Newslaundry? Apna business khol do didi. Digital content marketing aur baaki sab. Write your own article and slowly build up your website. Best of luck. write a book. anything that's stopping you from doing that? as in the beat that you cover is not popular etc? I agree with most of the opinions here: if you aren't in bad place financially, start your own channel/blog, and publicise the hell out of it on FB/Reddit/IG whatever. It doesn't require a lot of initial investment (financially atleast), and you'd also be adding worthwhile experience to your portfolio, further making you an attractive candidate later down the line.

If you need any help setting up something, you only need ask! You have it in you already, you just need to go ahead and give it your best shot.

You can do it OP; we all believe in you! :-) Happens. Do introspection. Figure out what is missing. Work on small small things > Guess, I am just tired of getting rejected

No one has the authority or power to reject you. You allow others to do so. So, there is no point in getting tired or feel bad. Rather, I see such 'rejections' as a difference of opinion, thats it..

Journalism, in the age of digital, is one of the most exciting things to do. Keep expressing your views, via words, videos, images, and choose a platform to do so. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube are the current hot favourites, and if you are consistent, the right eyes will see you, the right ears will hear you. 

7 years of experience doesnt matter in this dynamic industry.. Your voice, your persistence, and your unique angle of viewing things does.

All the best! Have you tried Zee News? Maybe your writing sucks ? OP, the market is currently fucked.

The options that are available aren't really lucrative and the options you want aren't going to become abundantly available anytime soon. Brace yourself for a long 'winter'.

I'm gonna make a few assumptions about you in this response and I apologise if any of them are wrong.

Being a journo in these trying times is a difficult gig for several reasons. Traditional media has frozen/slowed hiring because they are not sure their existing ways and methods will survive. New media requires an additional skillset that not many traditional journos readily have. Companies are looking to hire hybrids - candidates who can seamlessly switch between traditional and new media. You might want to consider re-skilling or upskilling yourself with a certificate/course from somewhere reputed.

This is above and beyond the fact that some places are just shit to work at - you know the one's I'm talking about. Most middle management in media is either incompetent idiots or assholes on a power trip.

That leaves you with independent journalism, which is way more difficult that most people believe it is.  Any idiot can put up a YouTube video (and most idiots do) but good, proper journos will agonize over every little detail and end up not posting anything. Independent journalism is a difficult, uphill climb but the view from the top is worth it.

My recommendation would be hit up your contacts from your job days and pitch them specific stories/ideas/solutions pertinent to their brand. Design your pitch such that it plays to your strengths and their needs. You'll get probably one meeting every ten pitches and your first okay after ten meetings. Be prepared for that.

Alternatively, you might want to do a John Galt (not a great example) and work in something completely unrelated.  This will help you in two ways - one, it'll help you earn some money, and two, it will give you the option of getting away from it all for a short while.

Good luck, OP. I   would   like   to  suggest   that   you   think   long   and   hard   about   how   much   effort   you've   put   into   your   career   versus   how   much   more   it   has   to   offer.   The   reason   being   I   have   a   friend   who   is   trained   with   two   relevant   degrees   and   a   masters   in   their   field   also   who   seems   to   be   struggling   to   find   regular   sustainable   work.    

It   might   be   that   unless   something   ""dream   job""   worthy   came   along   you   will   need   to   work   part   time   in   your   field   and   supplement   it   another   way.

I didn’t understand how they got points because the announcers were speaking Hindi (at least I assume it was Hindi). Can somebody explain this game and if it’s a very popular game in India?",willydillydoo," [Rules of Kabaddi.](https://youtu.be/d-9eTjuXymY) Yes it's popular in India, I have seen even Iranians come here to play Check out Pro Kabaddi league. 

Imagine a 20 yard strip like in Football. There is a team of 7 on each side of 10 yards. One player(attacker) from each side goes to the other side and tries to touch and out one of their players. The defendants try to not get touched or pull the attacker inside and not to let him go back until he leaves. The points on earned based on number of touches or number of pull backs. 

In a way it is like Football on a 20 yard strip with human instead of a ball. Lol you gotta check out rural olympics. maybe there are some youtube videos.

kabbadi is famous, like many other indian games, because all it needs is people, and no costly equipment. Yes",2019-12-16 08:56:29

I mean howdo you high tarriffs on Tesla and other Electric Vehicles with the lofty claims made by ministers ? Do we even have the infrastructure to support electric cars? Yahan road hai nahi.... RumTum Tesla ki baat kar raberahe ho It's not just import duties. I drive a Tesla. This car won't survive in Indian conditions without heavy modifications. The clearance is too low, the materials and paint too susceptible to the constant battering Indian roads provide, etc.

The core issue remain that they're expensive and this will be just another luxury vehicle that won't sell because the country simply doesn't have the infrastructure to support EVs. Anything that is environment friendly should have no import duties! Then don't import and build it in India. Why is the deer not working lmao? They are high cuz govt don’t wanna import them. Make them here China is far ahead of us in electronics manufacturing. Opening the door to imported EVs now would mean killing off the domestic auto industry and ushering in Chinese imports. Further, these EVs are not going to be powered by renewables, they are going to be powered my electricity which is produced in India by burning coal, which is worse than Petrol vehicles, so there is no real environmental benefit in switching to EVs today.

We need to make our electricity grid less dependent on coal and while doing so simultaneously get the infrastructure ready to produce EVs domestically in India so that they are at least somewhat competitive compared to imports, and only then push for their adoption. This means that there needs to be a phased adoption plan which industries can depend on to decide their investments and production targets. 

Allowing Teslas here today at no import duty does not really make any sense. Electric vehicles and super cars needs better infrastructure which is only seen near airports. If a normal consumer has pot holes and water logging on his street then he won't be encouraged to buy such vehicles. Surprise, let me guess so are taxes and having to pay a wage to workers.  Can't everyone just get on their knees throw money at them and beg for these saviours to grace us Good.

Sports,"One of my teachers in our school beats students very inhumanely, help !",104,eta25e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eta25e/one_of_my_teachers_in_our_school_beats_students/,42,"Our sports teacher beats students black and blue over trivial things like not standing in proper position while doing prayer or not following his barbaric discipline! Everyone knows it but no one does anything about it. What should I do? this outright cruel and should be stopped. Many students report being traumatized after his punishments. I need immediate help. What should I do?

PS: I study in 10th. I have only studied in this school for a year and i can't take this anymore. Please help",R_asberry," beating students is a punishable crime, no teacher can beat a student. You have the right to report it to the police. Maybe someone else more knowledgeable can pitch in with the details. Long ago, when I studied in KV Firozpore Cantt, we also had a sports teacher, Mr Sharma who used to beat up the kids, especially the small ones from the primary section. One day, he beat up one such kid and broke his leg with a hockey stick. What he did not know was that the kid's elder brother was the local goon. Result: Sharmaji ended up in the hospital the next day with several broken ribs and fingers. After some months he returned to his job but never again touched a child. Post it on Twitter to @NCPCR_ - the national commission for protection of child rights. Don't even bother with videos or anything - just tell them that this is happening and it's not right. 

It's illegal to physically punish a child in India. He has no right to beat a defenseless little kid. 

Also please ask your parents to complain to the police or to the district magistrate. Il Write a letter to your principal signed by everyone in your class, if he/she already knows about it write it to CBSE or whichever board you have, also to education ministry telling in depth of incidents. Go to the police with an adult and report it immediately. Why are sports teacher always so sadistic? Why do they have a case of repressed anger? From someone elses quora answer: 

>  Beating or abusing a student is a punishable offence under
RTE Act, 2009 Section 17( 1) 17(2),
JJ Act, 2000,
IPC
Section 305,
Section 323,
Section 325,
Section 326,
Section 352,
And above that it is cruel and sadistic…..

As someone else said, first step would be to go to the principal/teacher.
Second step would be to go to the police.

You can also try using this feature: https://www.childlineindia.org/a/report/case , there is an option to keep your contact details confidential. Arrange for video shooting the act. Post it in Twitter, describing the situation, mention education and HRD misinsters in the tweet. Sports teachers are usually temporary. If parents come together and complain, they can remove him I am truly sorry this is happening. It boils my blood.

Get adults/parents involved as soon as possible. Convince them to reach out to the School and to the Police if it does not stop. Also, ask your classmates/fellow students to do it too, so at least someone would be sensible even if your parents are not being supportive. did you talk to your parents about this? They might help you by talking to the principle. Have you told your parents about this?

IF you haven't yet, do so now.

Speak to your peers as well and get them to speak to their parents about this, you all can write a petition and go to the principal of the school about it.

If the approach above does not seem like the way you'd want to go, then

# Dial 1098

They will assist you, please don't hesitate to call them, they will listen to whatever you have to say and please urge your peers to do so too.

All the best! My sports madam once put used oil from the school canteen in our hair when we hadn't oiled them from home. We all had that one teacher. And 10th grade students don't do anything?
Lol here in Gurgaon the teacher would have been beaten to shit the moment he stepped out of the school premises. If you are afraid of reprisals and dont have any other way out - 

1) Create a new throwaway account.  Not very difficult for someone to connect the throwaway to this query, but there are these kind of PT teachers all over the country.  Hopefully you are not the only internet savvy kid in your class......

2) Post your school and tormenter on the new post with the throwaway account .... and every one of us, can use our twitter/channels to highlight the issue.  We'll report it, write to the principal, local cops.  Nothing like shining some light.  They may not take it seriously from a random stranger or two, but hopefully some of the other kids will speak up when questioned.

Stay well, and dont let this get you down.  Better you do something to fix this, than look back when you are 30 years old and wish you would have done something. Think very carefully before you do anything, this is india, if the pt teacher is connected to the principal then the principal can make your life living hell, theres no such thing as an anonymous complaint in india, they can easily find your name Dude. Inform the CWC i.e Child Welfare Commission and ask them to get case filed under s. 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act. Twitter pe photo video daal. Tag news channels and child ministry. Sit back and enjoy Please notify other parents about this teacher so that PTA members can speak to the Principal about this asap. Alternatively, you can write a letter with regards to any recent incident involving said teacher, (mention that corporal punishments aren't allowed in school and if action isn't taken y'all are willing to go a legal route or call the media) and have it signed by students and parents in your class.

That's lovely, glad she's with someone she loves. People normalizing this is what we need! :') Hope she doesn't get ostracized Good for her. I hope she's happy! Good to see a positive coverage. More power to her. I hope more more athletes and people in public sphere speak about it. More power to her!!

Let's just keep our fingers crossed that she doesn't get ostracized,given the 13th century mentality people have.
***
Just a general observation on the worldviews Indians have.
If you take a look at the article, you'll find some comments. The comment section is enlightening.

""Natural couples can procreate, but unnatural cannot..If unnatural is to become a norm, then we have to think seriously of bio-ethical issues arising therefrom..Better go the nature's way though we have got freedom, we can use it either way.""

""Shows a great decline in ethical and value understanding, forgetting what our ancestors (the great rishis) and developing a slavish western educated attitude(so-called modern)
Doom is near when we forget ours roots.""
***
This is a very very *healthy sign* that the times we are livin' in is 1319,not 2019.
As for the rishis,if this gentleman had the time to look into our scriptures,he would find the Ardhanarishwara form(which celebrates feminity). Countless other refutes could be provided.
It's high time,we step up the ante,and counter them. These kind of mentality would only cause our society to move towards an intellectual dark age. 
I'm simply surprised,that every divine pronouncement is taken support to voice his beliefs about ""unnaturality"" and the fact that ""it won't support procreation"".
Sir, we're already with a burden of overpopulation. If some people don't procreate (by virtue of nature), it's for better. More power to her. brave. respect to her God bless her, and may she get strength to win more medals for india Hope people to support her online, will do the same in real life too.

Because, soon she would need that help. This is what we need. Brave of her! Don't wanna be that person but

Yasss queen 👑🎊🗿 More power to her, Cheers for Love ♥️🇮🇳 Thats pretty a pretty bold move considering the mindset of most indians towards homosexuality. I bet she got death threats by some anti social elements.

Make it reach top 👍👍👍 Thank You for giving courage to others like me So one upside of athletics not being popular in our country is she can live peacefully even after coming out.

What would people say,

People say assholes, let them blabber 😁 Great step to get public and help others also to accept. More power to her. More Power to her 🤗 It's good to know that she is proud to announce that publicly but I wonder how her career is gonna turn out in future. The environment and society around her will surely not be that supportive. WITH HER COUSIN!  Dude I can support being gay but I draw the line at incest. Yay! Yay! One of the finest Indian athletes has come out. This is really big. More power to her <3 What a Goddess. Really appreciate her doing this. Glad India is progressing. This is amazing! I love it. I just think it takes a lot of guts and support to do what she did i.e. acknowledging her relationship to public even after the Sec.377 some people still don't want to accept the fact that yes same-sex relationship do exist.. 
Thank God India is Changing Brave lady Glad to hear someone speaking up. Now, that's progress.  
Feeling proud! Wonderful! Good on her 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩✊ Respect her decision to confess this!  ***Keep Calm and Marry On !!!!*** You go girl!! There is a really good radiolab episode on her - https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dutee. She discusses about genders and her ban. Good for her. Hope she doesn't get harassed by the wonderful people in our country. Fantastic! What a great role model. It's hard to be out in India, but those that are able to do it do such an important service to all the struggling young LGBT kids. I'm so proud of her! 

Speaking of Indian lesbians, I recently watched Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. I'll be honest, I've always disliked Sonam and Anil Kapoor for their acting. But the movie, was really touching. 

It helped a lot that Sonam didn't wear much makeup and it was not glamour-themed like most movies are. It helped to focus on the plotline which I think was VERY cute. 


PS: if anyone has seen the movie, can you tell me what the name ""Kuhu"" Means? It's an adorable name. Thanks Is anyone even reading that a 18 year old woman went into a relationship with a 14 year old kid? If this was a straight relationship, the lot of you would be running around with pitchforks and candles by now. Yeah nice. We gotta reason to burn her images. Yay Indians get to work. I wonder why....ahahah I didn't read the full stop after soulmate and thought she was in love with herself. Godspeed! It's a similar situation all over the world. No pro footballer will accept that he's gay ( while he's playing ). I mean, it's brave of her and everything. And I'm totally for it. But isn't she in a relationship with her cousin's daughter? Okay serious question.

Dutee Chand has been found to have high testosterone because of hyperandrogenism. She was even banned once by IAAF all though got reversed later. Does her high T has to do anything with her sexual orientation? Isn't she the same ahtelte who was suspended or something for not being a woman? Good for population control. Go girl ! Nobody cares! Isn't homosexuality harmful when we see it purely based on evolution ?? [removed] [deleted]",2019-05-19 11:52:16

Sports,Tablighi Jamaat & Covid,24,ftltyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftltyk/tablighi_jamaat_covid/,5,"It was extremely irresponsible for the members of the Tablighi Jamaat to have gathered in light of the covid pandemic. An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they've violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  


Let's look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  


1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  
And this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).
2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat's 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *""all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people"".*   
\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    
\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *""all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people""* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  
\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. 
3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  
In this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don't even have all the facts in the public domain.   
For instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.
4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as ""social distancing"" & ""self-quarantining"" weren't popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   
For instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) 
5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  


While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself.",CuteFaithlessness6," > While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good.

It's too late dude. Many people in my community now believe that muslims are deliberately spreading covid19. Even my parents think that muslims have ""shown their true colors"". These 2000 idiots have increased hatred for rest of the muslim community.",2020-04-02 20:54:47

1. Believe only the verified information from reliable source.
2. Be careful and alert in public, keep an eye out for sick, coughing peoples nearby.
3. Keep distance from people. Can be friends or colleagues.
4. Careful buying food, groceries etc. don't touch foods if you don't have to.
5. Wash hands [properly](https://www.who.int/gpsc/media/how_to_handwash_lge.gif).
6. Avoid Handshakes, Use verbal greetings instead.
7. Cough within [elbow angle](https://images.megapixl.com/1783/17830764.jpg).
8. Don't touch anything if you don't have to e.g. Bus, Train, vehicle poles and door handles.
9. Carry Hand sanitizer if you can.
10. Apply the sanitizer on area you touch like ATM, bus poles or other public used things you need to touch. ( little awkwardness in public is better than getting sick )
11. Non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided. e.g. sport events, concerts, meetups etc.
12. Get more information from [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) or other verified research institute.
13. suggest..

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

Sports,We are not perfect,607,e7s7rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e7s7rg/we_are_not_perfect/,380,"19(m) just an average boy in college with a messed up life..so the other day i overheard my parent's conversation about me where basically my dad went on to rant about how i have basically achieved nothing in life while kids my age(having no financial support)have done wonders. And I've come to realize how Indian society mocks and pressurize teenagers to be at the top while completely ignoring the fact that not everyone has to be perfect and there is no shame in admitting that we are full of flaws and I'm hope people come up with things they want to say about themselves not being perfect 

Here I'll start

""I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports""

Edit : this post is not about me complaining or whining about my parents...neither is it about seeking redressal for being a failure in life(becauselets be honest we'veheard that crap a ton of times)...Its more about accepting the way you are because here in India every judge's you ..from you looks to your talents to your abilities....its okay not to be special because a large portion of people are above you...sometimes being bad at something everyone expects you to bd good at or something that everyone is good at and your not is Okay !!",spacejesus01," I’m 24 and unemployed I’m 30 and my self esteem is still tied to approval from others. 20s, and I have zero ambition and drive. I'm 8 years old, I didn't get into IIT My dad stopped comparing me with others after  I was raged asf and started comparing him, his salary, our assets etc with my friends fathers and his friends.

Since that day, I’ve never felt soo good. I am 23, and scared to drive Unconditional love is a scam. Your parents,girlfriend also have certain conditions when they will love you. You have to have certain job, looks ,satisfy their expectations when they will ""love"" you. I found that recently I'm 28. By our society's standards, I'd be considered an achiever. And I fucking fought really hard for it after an extremely abusive and poor childhood. But, I have anxiety issues. People don't understand it though. 25 and anxious to drive a car after a bad accident. 😁 I have ambition but no dedication, I am extremely lazy. ""I am 49 and your dad is dumb."" I'm 31 and no idea what to do and scared about the future all the time. I am 31, have very very big aims in life. But not even moving a finger to achieve it.. I'm 26 and still in college. I'm 25, my man! Haven't driven anything ever. Here's more:

* No friends nearby. I have friends but not one single friend whom I can call up anytime.
* I have no job, I am working on my software product. So living with parents for past 1 year.
* No money. (read above point.)
* Father probably hates and sees me as a failure.
* He also thinks I'm not man enough because of next two points...
* Short for a guy. (5'4 ish)
* Skinny af.
* Never kissed or even had anything resembling a girlfriend.
* Did I miss anything? 19 hates driving,but is pressurized into doing it. There's too much pressure to be special, i mean somewhere here only you'll find someone saying ""no but you're different, you're not like everyone else"" is it that bad to be an average person ? I think it's okay to be okay. Well to all the boys... the only thing I can say having lived in a PG in Mumbai, sharing the room with 5 strangers, and surviving on a diet ofvada-pav is this

> it’s okay to be dejected,

> It’s  okay to feel like a complete failure,

> It’s okay to not find love,

> It’s okay to have disappointed parents,

> It’s okay not to have money,

> It’s okay to do a stupid job,

> It’s okay that no one gets you,

> It’s okay.

> It’s okay.


> But,

> never stop learning,

> never give up,

> never ever.



> And

> Be strong,

> Be humble,

> Be kind. Fuck society that tries to measure you, especially that of your parents. You’re you no one can compare you , but they will do that at every step.. They think it’s their job and they will be persistent and passionate about it , so you better develop some serious belief in defying them and believing in yourself instead of sucking up to their judgment.

Tell yourself this : Growing up in this sick society means developing a thick enough skin where you don’t care a shit about such opinions, and I hope you grow into a person that’s defined by you and you take pride in what you’re striving for.

Your personality, your yardstick... everything else can go get fuck itself. Its this attitude of parents that leads to teen suicides. I am sorry not trying to be rude about your parents.. but stating the facts. Can we get F's in chat? 23 completed my undergrad and pursuing CA and CS. Cleared intermediate exams for both with good score but I’m not even interested in the commerce field. 

Absolutely no idea what to do with my life and currently, just going with the flow. wtf are you supposed to achieve at 19? I've just popped in from the exchange with /r/Ireland, I hope that's ok! I felt the same at 19, dropped out of college and all that jazz. I got lucky with a job, got qualified picked up some hobbies and now I'm putting myself back through college. Take it as it comes, if you're not progressing in one aspect of life pick something else to move on in. I can't professionally move up for another year or so, so I've entered into relevant courses, started diving and learning new things.

As time goes on you'll see the similarities in how you feel and how everyone else acts, everyone is doing the same thing. Just be trying. Most parents think that millennials are dumb and are taking our nation to shit due to their smartphone and pubg addiction. But in reality it's the politicians voted by everyone including older generation. Tell him it's his genetics , all the overachievers usually have intelligent parents .... This will really piss him off I'm 24. I can't drive. I haven't even bothered to learn to cycle. You have all your life. Screw that shit. 19 is not even that old. You've technically not even started adult life. I'm 28. Bought my first car this year. Can't drive. Hate all sports. The idea of going to the gym makes me wanna cry. I’m 30 and broke Same here.

""When we were your age, we already had you. When we were your age, we had built a house of our own. When we were your age, we had a stable job. When we were your age..."", when you were my age, the country wasn't going to the dogs. When you were my age, the country wasn't going to run out of water in the next 5 years. When you were my age, things weren't as politically fragile as they are today. When you were my age, the economy hadn't collapsed from top to bottom. When you were my age a huge, unemployed youth population wasn't out either protesting for more jobs or slitting each-other's throats for one. Your time was different. Accept it and move on. I am from pakistan and faced same issue. I am 29 now and after finishing bachelors(8 years ago) I had hard time getting job like everyone else. My father used to mock me each and everyday that you are a failure and you will never achieve shit in your life. He used to say so by comparing me with one neighbor guy who got a good job as a developer. I had skills and did job which I quit after 6 months because my boss was a dick. I had been full time freelancer soon after my studies and when I started earning more than that “developer neighbor” then all the mockery stopped all of a sudden and I became their most faithful and successful son. I am currently doing my dream job outside country and living in company’s provided apparent with family. I will never forget those mockeries and will never have respect for my father which I wish I could have I sought my father's approval for the first 24 years of my life. In the last 6 months, I've been depressed and suicidal due to feeling like there was no hope for happiness in my future. 

I realised any father who put his daughter in a position to choose between her own happiness and pleasing him, is not a good parent.

Stopped giving a fuck about his approval. Took a lot of time and therapy. But it worked. Against his desires, I moved out of the country to find a future for myself and I'm struggling financially. I struggle for food. But I'm happier than I've ever been in all my life. 

Seeking validation and approval lead to no where. There will always be someone brighter, better and wealthier than you that people will compare you to. They will never be proud of what you've achieved and they don't need to. You need to be happy with yourself. And honestly that has changed my life. I never thought I could be that person.

Edit: I'm 25 and know how to drive because I got my license but never drive a car because im not confident. 19M, with a drop year (in the first year itself). Under average in studies. Physically ugly. Virgin, never kissed or hugged. Had girlfriend for 1.5years and turns out it was one sided from my side. Can't drive car but I can ride Activa. Have a really supportive bestfriend but I don't treat her right. My behaviour goes toxic when anyone proves me wrong. I feel your pain. But if you're willing to learn, find a  quiet place and a friend to help(if you can) and wake up early, like 4 - 5 am early and learn it. It should hardly take 6-7 days. I'm 21, have a job but am lazy as fuck ,very poor with my finances & afraid that I'm gonna end up alone First time huh? I hear that rant everyday, its to the point where it doesn't even affect me, i practically live with existential crisis and top that with being an introvert, no one is perfect but our society doesn't understand a simple fact that not everyone can become the top 2% in a rat race that only favours the academically superior, but we apparently can't do anything do about it so just go with the flow, pretend it's the rainy season of your life, it'll pass and the sun will shine one day, just keep on trying I'm 16....got rejected by my crush day before yesterday....self esteem is pretty low...and seeing others like me on reddit makes me genuinely happy. it's interesting as a Canadian of Indian immigrants seeing the youth of India questioning aspects of Indian culture.  It's similar to what kids of expats went through when our parents first moved away.    
Not that the globe is smaller and ideas proliferate so quickly, Indian youth are going through the same cultural revolution that we dealt with.  Still one foot firmly planted in tradition while the other desperately dragging itself to a new reality  
I only offer the advise that stay true to yourselves.  There is merit in buying into the system, but don't be defined by it.  Play music, draw pictures and do the other things that are ""frowned"" upon cuz ""ye saab se paisa nahi aiga"".   
I also understand better the pressures previous generations felt, and so it's natural for them to push on to their kids.  Treat your parents with kindness, for they know not what they do .. they too are struggling with how the world has changed before them Bro start driving using a small automatic hatchback. It's so easy to drive and also have big red 'L' stickers on your car , you can remove it once you learn how to drive. Usually people understand when they see the 'L' sticker and will give you way and won't criticize you. Wake up at 5 am and learn to drive on empty roads first, once you get the hang of it go into usual traffic. I have seen people drive with L stickers for even upto 6-8 months. But make sure you learn to drive a car before you finish college it'll be absolutely necessary. Even experienced F1 drivers would be scared shitless when they drive for the first time in Indian traffic. I screwed up and failed my car driving test and that's saying something, as our country's driving test is an absolute joke and is perhaps, one of the easiest tests out there, in this world of ours.

This happened when I was around 19 years of age (almost 5 years back). I mean, I had hopes and aspirations that I would have obtained a license asap, the moment I turned 18. Well, it sucks I suppose, for life to not turn up the way one hopes too, even if they give their darnest best to make it happen.

I guess, my neuroticism and anxiety ruined that test for me, on that fateful day. Prior to reaching the testing grounds, my instructor made me do a trial on the roads, which I did a good job of and he assured me that I'll surely pass the test as long as I maintain my cool and composure.

But, he couldn't accompany me on the grounds and instead, another instructor who had no clue of my temperament and personality came. And he didn't help things for me. For every minor mistake I made, he kept belittling me, dismissing my anxiety and nervous attitude and told me as to how I seemed to be the weakest out there, when compared to other candidates who came along with me.

And thus, I was completely demoralised and failed the test. Everyone present on the ground, were laughing at me for my ineptitude in handling the vehicle. Did not speak with anyone, on that day. I'm 23, and I still haven't learnt to drive. Just saying:  


I was afraid to drive, and have never ridden a bicycle till this summer. I got a job and was about to move to Bangalore. I knew that I had to learn it, and if I stay afraid now, I'll hate myself for this in future.  


So in a span of 2 months, I learnt how to ride a bicycle, then a scooty and a car back to back. Sometimes the motivation comes from necessity. Let me see. 23 y/o, male. 

1. cant drive any motorized vehicle.
2. cant dance, cant party
3. cant be ""social"", some dumb-fuckery by someone always flips me off
4. In a quest to learn as much as possible. so that makes me a prick
5. Dont watch movies.
6. Dont like eating.
7. Dont particularly travelling In big groups. 
8. obsessive planner, not so much on the execution side.
9. One decent relationship that lasted 6 months.

&#x200B;

note: i can and do ride bicycles and I do trek solo (started this recently) My dad made me drive when I was 19 ( now 21 ) and I got involved in 3 minor accidents and naturally developed a fear of driving cars. I can drive two wheelers fine but they still mock for not being able to drive a car. Honestly this is more because of a breakdown in communication than anything

A lot of Indian parents are great at raising and talking to their kids till they're 12-13 but seem to completely lose it after that

Its important to note that you can't control or govern your kids lives as they get older and that they still need unconditional help and support from their parents

Kids are too afraid of their parents to say no when they get forced into following some field or career and parents are too focused on the future to see what's happening with their kids in the here and the now


That being said the kid themselves isn't blameless.. A lot of bright minded smart kids just lose the will to study/work/perform... And there is little their teachers or parents can do to understand if there is no communication.


As for you OP... If you have a clear idea of what you wanna do in life then let your parents know about it... Let them understand that you have a goal that you're working towards.. An aim that you want to achieve

They may be bullheaded about it but they still want the best for you.. Using my throwaway porn account because I don't want my irl friends to find out about his, ever.

20, Final year of BCA. Since I'm a failure (not engineer), My school friends consider me a failure and try really hard to hide that because that don't want to hurt me (Or maybe I'm insecure, Idk)    

* I still live with my parents, and I regret not living out on my own at least once every week.
* I know I'm not stupid (I'm always one of the first ones to build up logic for a program, I'm good at few things) but I have never achieved anything in my life, used to score \~50% in schools and hence have trouble with my self image in this aspect (If I'm smart who just sucks at studies or if I'm dumb and just pretending to be smart).
* Current college is shitty as fuck, I have grown to hate this city because I want to live away from it.     
* My dressing sense sucks, but I try to mask it with an ""I don't care what I wear"" attitude     
* I'm supposed to be preparing for MCA, which, if done from good college, Is the only way I can start earning. I have studied nothing in last 5 days, And my MCA entrance is 3 months away. I had told my Pune friends that I'll be visiting them around 18th of December, but now I'm having second thoughts because of not studying. I'm not prepared at all for this, I feel like I'm gonna be a fuckup. and the worst part of this is I'm not even trying to change things.
* I have a gaming problem, when I'm left with games, I stop prioritizing things, and play it till everything else is collapsed... Last time I spiraled out on my gaming thing, I ended up scoring really bad for my 12th exams (Hence didn't take engineering)  
* I'm really self critical, self conscious and a self loather (Not proud of it). There is something wrong with me, psychologically, But I don't know what. Parents won't understand what therapy is (Typical ""you're not crazy, try going out more"" mentality, I don't blame them for it). I have planned to get therapy with my own money once I start earning, Which won't be anytime soon.
* I know I won't do it. but I passively think that if I don't settle down by 25 (or atleast start to settle down), I will kill myself  (Again, I won't do it. I have felt suicidal twice in my life, and didn't even try to harm myself those two times.)

I don't even know why I'm posting this here, I guess I just need to vent. 19 , Didn't get into IIT even after taking drop, have zero friends and no accomplishments, Never had a GF , total waste of parents money Dude that pressure will always be there, irrespective of your age. Today it is abt your studies, tommorow it will be abt job, then about marriage and kids. 
I stood up to my dad only after engineering, i finally got the balls to say that i want to do business and not want to work in a MNC.
He listened to me for the first time after that full blown argument.
Now he encourages(read pressure) me to expand my business 😅 Turned 22 today, absolutely no direction in life. Have no idea what I really like doing. Most of us deal with this on a daily basis, correct me if I’m wrong. We could all use a hug right now. 
But only thing that keeps me going is no matter how hard or shitty a day gets, it doesn’t last more than 24 hours. I feel slightly better knowing that. Hopefully this changes the way you perceive things. Well I'm a teacher wage about 3000 RS per month 22 year old, lazy but hard working , have a dream of becoming an scientist or programmer but dream crushed by the same people The comparisons to other people of your age is normal and everyone has faced this in their life. Note that, I am saying everyone has faced this doesn't mean that it is right and in the contrary, it is detrimental on the mindset of how we are brought up. The fact is that after our parents do this comparison, some people don't give a damn after a certain age but some people still end up comapring themselves with their peers. 

Yep, nobody is perfect but we have to do something meaningful in the world to earn our living, etc. How do you want to earn your living and lead your life should be up to you and you alone, IMHO. If it comes down to something down something along the lines of '""Sharmaji Kya sochenge?""To kahiye sharmaji khud ke baare me soch lein, hum apna dekh lenge.' The way you wrote your post. It seems you stopped before you even started. 


You really are not perfect are you comrade I'm 36 and can't afford a car. Forget driving anything. >I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports

That's my description. Except I'm 22 Oh man that line 19 and can't ride a bicycle hit me. I am 20 i wasn't able to ride bicycle but few months back i made up my mind that i will learn after a week i was able to ride a little bit now i can ride a motorbike (not perfect ) . And also i have started focusing on my life i learned c , python and have started focusing on study . I would also like to mention i flunked in maths in 12 so i would like to say its never too late to change. 23, graduated last year, was working at a job I'd landed through campus placements.
But quit, because, big dreams, preparing for a very unpredictable exam with no back-ups whatsoever.  
No idea what's going to happen if my plan falls apart. Im 19 and I haven’t spoken to a girl in over 7 months I'm 27 and I'm alone. I'm 19 and I can't speak to someone(immediately) new especially if they are girls or someone of greater my age! I'm 20 and feel you. Financial freedom will get you out of misery. Try doing things that can get you some money here and there. Stock trading and shit. Once you start making enough on the side to help with some expenses at home meanwhile you do stuff for yourself nobody will say shit. I honestly feel like people need to know this one trick. It is a shame that you feel that way. Unfortunately Indian parents have a tendency to push their own fragile ego and aspirations on their kids. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you and don't let the things that your parents say get inside of your head. Get a job, become financially independent and move out. Just do not continue to engage in the toxicity of your parents otherwise things will only become worse for you. I am around 40. I moved to Europe decades ago for IT work, which I am still doing. A lot of my friends in India, some didn't even finish school, are now vastly better off that me financially. Two owns businesses and employs 50+ people. At least 6 have amassed so much wealth (land, properties) that they could retire any day they want. I have 20 years left on my mortgage here.

/I am not complaining though, I have a very good life. I'm 26 and I can't drive (but I'm gonna get back to practice soon). Graduated with an engineering degree at 22 from a national top 10 school, but working hard to re-enrol in a good college so I can finally study things I've always wanted to. Have a lean built but never made a serious effort to get a buff physique as I always found gyms expensive. Promised myself I will get over my discomfort and go to the gym every day when I get into college (and finally have time again). 20. Failed 2nd year of med school, taking a break for one year. Dad says he's ashamed of me and wouldn't talk to me. I've been sent to another city because he can't stand seeing my face, or hearing my voice. I can't talk to people my own age or people in general for that matter, even for small talk. I'm overweight. I'm 17 and supposed to crack JEE but don't know shit about solving those kind of problems, JEE starts on 8 Jan, fml 22 and can't drive because I hit my face on an iron fence while learning. Safe to say I'm perpetually petrified of vehicles and fences. 

Also intrusive thoughts. Does anyone else deal with thoughts that'd lead to brutal death while driving without anything even happening or is it just me lol I’m 31 and never been in a real romantic relationship. Wtf is wrong with me. The worst thing is the disappointment more than unemployment you see on the other fucking faces that we've let them down voluntarily & suddenly we become the bad guy 
Fuck this society I'm in my 3rd year of engineering. I feel like a complete shit. My parents are supportive of my decisions, but I give up things when the going gets tough for example Competitive coding and divert myself with porn or reddit.  

I do not have a routine. I lack consistency and discipline. But I want to get rid of this lethargic feeling that I get. Man... I'm loosing control over my actions. Any advise would be appreciated kind Randians. i choose Non medical but i dont wanna join IIT 20s, I fell from my scooter once, it wasn't a big fall neither was it very serious but couldn't bring myself to drive a two wheeler again. Learnt to drive my car, once i couldn't start my car on time after the green light and i don't need to explain the commotion i created at that time, which scared me a lot and im too scared to drive now. Also my left leg feels like it will fall off in pain due to me controlling the clutch in heavy bangalore traffic. So im a lazy and untalented according to my parents. Lol ok parents, im your child who has your genes

also using public transport is better for the Environment Exams after two days and I haven't completed anything properly. I am 18 and I have zero self confidence and even though I have been a performer before, now I am just really scared of going on stage and its funny because in my life  all I wanted was to be on a stage performing.

p.s. I am a trained dancer. 28 still studying .. This website is weird AF.

\> I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports

Sports? Never knew Indian parents gave two shits about sports. Play anything, you will get flying HC Verma on your face [deleted] Indians parents are one of the worst in the world. I am 1.6lpm guy but my failure  count is much more than  success count . Sure, society does put pressure but don't use the anti-thesis to just be lazy. Dream, work for them, else life is just pointless void without real higher purpose anyway. Bro. Just find out what you really like and work towards it. It might be against their will but that's how you can give an answer to them and to the society. 20 and still confused if I want to become a software engineer or a musician. I mean I love both but I'm not very good in either of them. :( Rather than think about what you are not good at, think about what you like and are good at or can be good at.
You don’t judge a horse by how fast it swims and a fish by how fast it runs.

If you are not good at studies, maybe you like cooking, or art, or sports, or gardening etc.

Find your passion...
Don’t let a negative opinion define you. This is all a direct result of Capitalism tbh. I'm n years old, and I can't do a lot of things - but unlike the losers who don't want to put in the effort to be able to do those things, I genuinely want to improve, and am working toward being what I expect myself to be, instead of whining about it on the internet. In the mid-20s. Unemployed for over a year. No social life anymore. Skinny, tall and bald. Very anxious about everything. I'm good at driving, just anxious. Failed driving test. 23 and hate myself to the core. I had social anxiety so talking to others really makes me nervous. I am so perfectly imperfect. I'm in my late twenties and I'm rediscovering life after nearly a decade of depression.

I'm still depressed, of course, but I don't have to let that define me, or dictate who I am or my actions. I've been depressed so long that my childhood memories seem like they happened to someone else. Like I was an observer to my own childhood.

But eventually the clouds will clear, even if it seems impossible. We will never be perfect, but we will bear our crosses and carry on. Because that's life. Suffering, peppered with moments of joy, pain, heartbreak, melancholy, and loneliness.

You'll be alright. We all will be. Its perfectly fine to be self-aware and being comfortable with yourself. But more importantly its necessary to try and fail rather than just being a silent observer and judging other's opinions. If you have anything that keeps you awake at night, you must pursue that coz it's the effort that counts more than success usually. I dont like any sports thats just okay. But ARE YOU AN ENGINEER ? Abey fuck same Logged in to tell you this. I learnt to cycle at age 28 and now I often bike 30 kms to work. Hang in there dude, you'll get there.! The way you wrote your post. It seems you stopped before you even started. 


You weren't joking when you said you weren't perfect comrade I am 21, I'm scared to learn to drive a car. I also sometimes feel like I've wasted myself academically to the point that there's no climbing back up for me. I also put off seeing a psychologist cause I feel anxious to even go lol I moved to Canada when I was 22 and long story short, I fucked some things up and came back to India 2 years later. Now I'm 25, battling depression, still unemployed but trying my best, listening to parents' whining almost every Sunday.

So, you're good! I am 23, and not able to drive a bike, recently learnt to ride scooty on street. I am graduated and got a decent job with decent pay. Yet, so doubts that not able to interact and have a deep conversation with anyone easily. Lonely af. Still life is beautiful. I have been a "" Sharma ji ka beta"" Kinda guy in whole life. So can't even complain. :). I like how OP is talking about accepting ones faults while the comments are filled with suggestions on how to fix that fault. 

Thanks for proving his point? I'm 30, fat(29 BMI) and haven't gotten promoted in a looooong time! I am 21 and i cant talk to girls. Yea the irony being ( in relation to the post) I know what iam doing but it ain’t progressing. 

Fingers crossed As someone who's disabled and struggles with mental health, I've had a lot of other things happen in my life that has made me feel in similar ways. 

&#x200B;

I have developed a very anticapitalist mindset as a result. Fucking wholesome this thread. I'm 26, graduated in hotel management, decided not to pursue the career, did MBA in marketing didn't wanted to do field work, did digital marketing course, didn't liked it, so here i am, working in a KPO as a fresher, on minimum wages, clueless of what I am going to do next.... Oh and did I tell u that I am socially awkward and a virgin who never had a girlfriend, yeah that and I sometimes hope for an alien invasion so that my society's focus diverts from me! I'm 19 (M)

First year at IIT. 

Severe body dysmorphia that I tell no one about. 

An ldr that I'm desperately invested in. 

No friends in college. 

Read incel websites and find myself agreeing with bits and pieces of it. Feel terrible immediately afterwards. We all Drew a tangent to the op conversation. I have heard countless stories of your loved ones comparing you to someone else. I feel so hopeless for such loved ones of mine they have spent all of their life comparing crying and living to fit in the society. “You have to this to make good name” “what will society think” “will you go marry a girl pf different caste and make us look like we raised a fool” The core message is *stop living for people and society start living for yourself*. I hope to get this in my grand pa’s head someday! You just copied my situation, although I'm 18, not 19. Guess some things about boomers never change. You are not trying to achieve and like to stay remain where you are so, not taking any chance to do new thing. Thats great. People should accept you. You are normal. Don't listen other. Do what you want. I dropped out for 3 years and did nothing with that time Seeing all the people who are scared to drive I think you could also blame Indian roads and driving practices. I too hate driving because I have a terrible attention span. But it's doable as long as you take enough caution. I am trying to loose weight since 2006, I am 26 😢 The other day I saw fuckin rickshaws drive on the footpath , ofc now I'm scared to drive I'm 19 and I'm in college and I just feel numb most of the time and I'm lacking self esteem and have zero ambition in life. I don't know how I'm gonna get through this but I'm going to fucking get out of this shitty state. That’s just bad parenting - showing that your parents aren’t perfect either :) I'm 18, and feel isolated in most social situations. The few people I am close with to the point where this isn't a factor are toxic and make me a worse version of myself. I want to make better, more meaningful relationships but my low self-confidence and insufficient social aptitude make it difficult.

&#x200B;

:') I am 22, overweight, and procrastinate alot I am 17 and very socially awkward. I have trouble talking with strangers and making new friends. I am 18 and just want to die. I'm 19 and I forget to take towel with me to the shower . Hi maybe i can advise u on what u can do. Can i ? I'm 20, I've given NEET 2 times and I haven't got in. *""The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.""* --Mahatma Gandhi Okay guys, I will start practicing driving yet again this week.. I've been neglecting this due to the anxiety of driving a car after I near drove my car into a marsh People who complain about a generation forget who raised them. Expectation is a two way street. I'm 19 and I've lost interest in life. Don't give a fuck about anything, not even my parents. I haven't cried properly in 4 years thanks to extreme bullying and shaming in high school. Don't get me wrong , I love life. Suicide is the last thing i will ever think about. But , I just want to have more confidence  in myself. I'm completely emotionless, have 0 interest in life in any aspect. I don't play any game more than 3 minutes, don't read a book or a topic more than 2 lines and give up on a task even before I start.  I just want to feel an emotion. that'd be good. Hello there. Well hate to break it to you, but you are not even at the worst stage of your life. Soon in a few years you'll be pressured to get married. And yes arranged. And if you still don't have a job? Be ready to face the wrath of your parents. Yeah Indian society. I mean of course they mean well but this isn't the way. Man sometimes i think what if I become scientist or programmer should I'd be happy I am 21, too chickenshit to drive or ride a bike, thinking about dropping out of post grad I am 23 and I was super scared to drive in India. While my friends had their licenses and driving their cars, I used sit in the back seat. It's only when I moved abroad I learnt how to drive. Oh and I also dont know how to ride a bicycle, bike or even swim."" I'm 19 too and I can't think anything else other than just killing myself. I'm 29 and I've not saved my first million ₹ yet. 22. IIT graduate. Didn't learn a thing about Engineering. No idea what to do with my life. I can relate, buddy. 
Indian parents expect their children to be like satya nadela or Bill gates. 
When we tell them that we can't, they come up with bullshit stuff like - 'look at that guy, he had nothing and now he is -insert a high level title-' 
Or  ' We sacrificed so much for you, at least do this or that' I am 23 (M). Here are some of my flaws/failures:

1. I didn't complete a B.Tech. from IIT or a B.Sc. from St. Stephen's. I could never sort out my priorities as a teenager so I ended up attending a ""decent-ish"" DU college instead. 

2. I do not work for McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Amazon, or Google. My family believes that I am competent enough to reach great heights, and I try my best to make them proud, but so far my path has only been full of disappointment.

3. My girlfriend, whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, grew uncertain about the future of our relationship so I ended things on a bitter note. In hindsight, maybe I couldn't handle all the stress and acted rather impulsively. I still think about how I could've done better in that situation.

4. I've got no real friends whom I can depend upon to always have my back. There are plenty of friends, but no one who will sit with me and genuinely inquire about my problems. I guess I might've taken the nicest people that came into my life for granted, and now it's impossible to completely fix that even through honest apologies.


It sucks to have to deal with all this, but I've somehow learnt to find happiness in the small things. More importantly, I choose to focus on becoming a better version of myself everyday and not get too affected by my past. Maybe, there is a bigger plan that's laid out for me and I just can't see it yet? Who knows... 25 M, cant drive, extremely overweight(borderline obese), no zero ambition or drive for anything in life. Constant complainer and down in the dumps dummy Hey dude I feel like I've done nothing many times - especially when I perform lower than what others expect (which is your case I believe).

If thinking that ""Indian society is shit and makes you feel shittier"" makes you feel better, be it. Sometimes having a certain opinion about something can make us fell better. 

However, you can't hate on your parents, or as a matter of fact, any blood relation always. I try to convince myself by thinking that most Indian parents care more than parents in other cultures do. It has its advantages and disadvantages. I'm sure we do get a lot more moral support sometimes (not all) than others. But sometimes over expectations leads to such situations.

Edit: corrected spelling [deleted] My friend is 30 years old at this moment.
He has never driven a motorcycle in his entire life so far.

Sports,What's the best way to get all sports channels on Tata Sky?

But after the Trai changes, it got converted to a stupid plan of only a few HD channels. It seems to be very expensive.

Sports,How should I feel?,10,fn5zmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fn5zmp/how_should_i_feel/,6,"How should I feel that I'm privileged? I'm 25, earning 60k, and it's not that I'm dumb or something but sometimes I feel how to feel. My dad's a government officer, mid-fifties, earns more than a lac. He's the most hard working and disciplined person I have ever seen. He's in the government since his early twenties. He's just 3 years away from retirement. He loves reading and love making contacts. My mom's a housewife(mid-forties or late forties, lol I don't know her date of birth), she's sweet, lovely, caring and love making people happy. My sibling is the best. He's earning okay. My parents have raised me well. I'm glad I grew up in the nineties, so I developed a lot of interest in sports and played a lot of them at competitive levels. I had a profound interest in video games and computers. My dad bought a one in the early 2000s I guess, with Windows 95 on it. He used it for typing, there was something FoxPro thing I don't exactly remember he used to do. Then most of my 2000s went playing with friends, games, school, etc. It was real fun, to be honest. I cherish those memories, a lot. College was not so good, but okay kinda. I realized a hell lot in college, not the studies haha but a lot about me. I'm not on Facebook and Instagram, quit them already. In the past year, I've developed a rigorous thinking about work and how not to throw away your life. It's really turning good for me. I follow Angel co-founder Naval and like him a lot. He's a good man. All in all, I have my interests or niche that I follow. It's good to not be mainstream sometimes. I don't have a goal. The only thing I know is to work hard, improve my skills and learn continuously. I joke at people who settle down and say learning stops when you get old. I call bullshit. 

But I don't know how should I feel? Being in a country with people who are deprived of such things. Should I feel guilty or thankful? I would think, if I was born in a poor family, I would've been living a mediocre life, with struggling to survive. I think when I reach 30, I will be financially independent. Only dependencies I want are my parents and sibling. No external sources like marriage or some other shit.  They raised me right, now it will be my turn to be with them at old age. 

Thanks for reading.",HumanWhoLikesDogs," You seem like a balanced person, someone I would enjoy having a drink with. 

I think the answer to your question is clear - do as much as you can to bring privilege, education and opportunity to those that don't have those things. 

Or perhaps make as much money as possible, and live your life doing the things you enjoy. I'm guessing your thought process would naturally lead you to the former option in any event. When do you plan to marry and get settled?",2020-03-23 03:55:23

Sports,Why are there no indian cheerleaders??,20,es9hc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es9hc2/why_are_there_no_indian_cheerleaders/,32,"This is a serious question. Ive typed indian cheerleaders on youtube, google, google images, etc and literally all of the results are of european girls. 

In IPL, ALL of them are european girls. 

Culture cant be the only reason. I mean in such a huge population, there should be some that are open enough to perform routines. 

Is it regarding attractiveness? Theres no shortage of bombshells in india, especially given the population. I would really love our beautiful brown women to take up this sport. Its a well respected sport in many developed countries.

I seriously dont get it lol. Why bring girls all the way from europe and north america?

Same thing with bollywood and the background dancers but there are some indian dancers still in there.",Dungeonmaster0396," Cheerleading is not a recognised sporting activity India. In fact, it's not very popular outside of the States. While growing in popularity in some western countries, competitive cheerleading is not attached to a lot of sporting events. So, not a lot of what would be called actual cheerleaders would not be found in India. And for IPL, the so called cheerleading was nothing but a commercial eye candy spectacle. Want more people showing up to fill stands, give Indian men white women in skirts to look at. CSK used to have Indian cheerleaders. They even had a guy cheerleader. If I remember correctly there was also something about the colour of our skin. We discriminate a lot (which is also why we don’t see any Latina/Arab or black cheerleaders) Amit Malviya, Tejinder Bugga, Payal Rohatgi would be amazing as cheerleaders They're either gonna get raped, groped, cat called, slut-shamed or all together.

Our society is happier oppressing people, human rights & basic human decency and all, are unimportant.

Also,

""Log kya kahenge""
""Aise kapde pehene to mard kya karega?"" I think its the same reason why we don't have strip clubs. Our society looks down on it because its not pure or its against godliness all that stuff. Must be something about indian mentality. Cheerleading is probably down there with lap dancing and mujhra dancing. People think it's a low job that doesn't deserve any respect. Until this changes then you probably wont see indian cheerleaders on google youtube etc. Its really sad as there is nothing wrong with this type of work. This is what keeps you up at night? CSK, KKR and the defunct PWI have Indian cheerlearders donning traditional clothes. Google Images should give you some pics! I guess when IPL started, Lalit Modi and the powers at that time decided to import the cheerleaders to get more eyeballs in, and that trend has continued.",2020-01-22 17:09:15

Sports,Why isn’t scholastic wrestling not a part of extra curriculum in Indian Schools despite wrestling being a popular sport in Indian culture?,15,dnq7jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dnq7jf/why_isnt_scholastic_wrestling_not_a_part_of_extra/,5,"Wrestling or kushti in hindi seems to be one of the most popular indian sports and martial art of India. The history of Akharas makes it look like India really is into wrestling. So much that often time whenever a normal indian fights you can see him using a crude style of wrestling.

But despite all the cultural history wrestling is not a sport ever present in Indian schools while American schools all have a good wrestling team with them.

This seems like a result of bad mentality among Indians that sports are a waste of time and study is everything that matters.

And most parents are so overprotective that they wouldn’t allow their ward to train in fear of him being hurt or injured?",The_New_Renegade," Because kushti is very limited to parts of North India, and it's not very common anywhere else.  Sure, if it's popular in a locality, they should promote it there but I don't see kids in Mizoram being as excited about it as Punjab. I can think of two reasons:

1) In india entrance tests are pretty much the key to higher education and career prospects, so there is no point in spending time on sports
2) Not all colleges give admission based on sports quota, unlike western colleges where a number of athletes go to to colleges based on sports scholarship Infrastructure and lack of coaches. Otherwise it is just shortsightedness of the education-focused country. Because many prefer taikwondo or karate.",2019-10-27 15:27:44
Sports,60 thousand fans turned up today to support the Indian football team against Bangladesh.,3443,dib0ns,https://i.redd.it/pkvfka0smqs31.jpg,119,,Poirot17," we should have won against bangladesh .. draw is a tad disappointing. YBK is a great venue to play for the country Isn't this at Salt Lake Stadium? Indians started loving cricket after 83 win... Maybe if the current team could win something big people would go crazy... I truly believe in the next 4-5 years India is going to be a competent side I like the banner with Mohammedan Sporting, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. Let's not forget the originals! I was on my way to a late meeting before the match, and EM Bypass that connects the stadium was jam packed with cars and bikes, with Indian flags all over, Flying high. Some of them wore cricket jerseys as well lol but the passion in my city for football is crazy and as a fan I love it. Imagine playing in a world class stadium with jam packed audience chanting football slogans and appreciating every forward pass you make, It feels like home. I love the fact that so many people turned up for the game. Sad that we didn't win but absolutely love the support that was shown to the team. Hey I can see myself!! My small rant about the situation of football in our country: 

You need development from basic stage, And one of the biggest drawbacks for India is the weather then you have diet issues and no proper scouting and organizational structure. I can share a small story that might interest some of you  

I come from a small town surrounded by many Adivashi colonies, During my schooling I was an active football player and I even played inter divisional football for the South Eastern Railways, That time I used to see some Adivashi folks joining us in training and were of the same age but much stronger core to us ( Credit to their hard work and natural diet ), Some of them used to drive a van or rickshaw for the whole day in that summer heat and then came to practice, We still had a hard time beating them, Heck when after 70 mins we looked drained they ran like arrows Over the time as we grew priorities for them changed , I leaned for most they had to earn in order to even put food on the table. I was privileged enough to be able to play but not to pursue,  education doesn't exactly go well with sports and Indian parents in our country, Our coach tried his best to raise awareness and setup small funds from the local shops but in a small town there's only so much you can do, People like these gets lost in the never ending rat race of survival in our country and talents don't get a platform or a chance to prove themselves or gets exposure to actually do anything, be it in training or development. 

We still do not have mentality to attend or endure whole season of football, Let alone the I League. Community Shield etc. ISL is only for a short period of time and tbf it's doing more wrong than good, but still the initiative is good, as no one else fucking bothers.

I still hope one day indian kids will dream of playing football for our country / clubs abroad and people will get behind their players like they do for cricket now.

Edit: retarded typos. A sight to see.. I’d pay to watch this ... tired of paying big bucks to watch euro friendlies. Football is slowly picking up pace in India. With so many young kids attracted to club football in Europe and better focus on training facilities, India will slowly improve its standing. But it's still a long way to go, maybe 10-15 years before we get to the top 50 rankings. ...and got disappointed. A win would've been the true appreciation for the people present.. Nevertheless, good show! Loved the giant poster consisting portrait of 3 players wearing East Bengal FC, Mohonbagan FC, Mohammedan SC jerseys standing in a huddle.. ,😍 This is proud for any nation, for this kind of fan following. Yuba bharati kirangan 🧡 U/manjit2990 did u watch it or to maybe support the BD team against India? ^(/s) The mecca of Indian Football.. people in Calcutta share an equal passion for Football and Cricket. just wish t'was the same in the whole country I'm from Bangalore and support BFC. In the initial seasons, the much talked about West Block Blues held up a banner,that is still held up at major games today. That message is all inclusive and is ever more important now.

""The road is long, but the belief is everything. Stand up for Indian football.""

Never been so proud to see a packed stadium for our games. Unpopular opinion: Team performs better without Chettri.  [SC: We couldn't deliver a performance to match the atmosphere at the Salt Lake last night, and the dressing room is very disappointed about it. We couldn’t capitalise on the chances we got,but this is a process on the pitch and in the stands. You turned up, we'll keep attempting to.](https://twitter.com/chetrisunil11/status/1184295678626779137) Do the people on seats under the big flag get to see the match? Or are those seats empty? 60, 000 there, yet still no comments here. +1 Koi video dikhao bc Amazing Spectacle Keep it up Good news! Love it :) Cuz there are too many of us to go around Soo much support. Yet internationally so behind. 

My take: Sporting culture is minimal. No places to casually play. Courts, grounds, spaces are accessible for the  rich only.  Developed parks have the infuriating ""Park mein football aur ball sports khelna mana hai"" (football and ball sports not allowed).  I have seen people stopped for playing catch with a tennis ball. ""band karo ye!"" ""park ka satyanaash kar diya hai!"" (stop this. Have spoiled the park)

Development, training, diet are obviously important. But loads of countries ahead of india in football have these problems. There definitely seems support for Soccer in India. How has it not translated to something like cricket. This is kolkata we are talking about the turnout is expected. I think crickets popularity will be over within 2 decades because the game is too long as well as boring because it is almost entirely dominated by our country now. And sports like football will rise in popularity but i am not sure if sports will ever be as popular as west in our country because we never had a sports culture in the first place and it is introduced at a time when video games are rising in popularity , and second thing is most of these outdoor sports originated in the west where temperature is cold but in the scorching heat of india i dont know how comfortable it is to play these sports thats why i believe sports like kabaddi are better suited for indian environment and might become popular once again someday or some new indoor sport might be created . JAI HIND Glad that football is picking up in India, but I feel like instead of organising matches in cricket stadiums building more quality football only stadiums and keeping matches there will really be a huge boost to the game here. More fan come to see Kerala blasters play Stop hyping this dumpster team. Indian football is corrupt and will take a 1000 years to even qualify for the world cup. They can't even defeat Bangladesh.. pathetic Virat ne kaisa perform kia? :) Feels like a slutty click bait title. 60k people went to see an interesting match. Not necessarily to “support” India [removed] Can someone explain how Qatar couldn't beat us in their own backyard? Was it the under 14 women team or something that were playing against us that day?

It's like the Ikea of sportswear/clothing. Decathlon near my home organise events, from small walks for a cause to random cycling. Though a small town, it often has active participation of locals. 

Also, their staff are directly involved in these training activites, kinda makes the whole experience great. More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  

Nike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. 

For context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I'm going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :) 

Fuk u Adidas I don't know of anyone's been to decathlon's in Bangalore but somehow in all of them, the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s, you can tell from the way they speak and dress, their English is like those South Bombay kids. I have even seen foreigners work as staff. This is very weird because you don't see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people. Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class. I just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things. Even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful. I wish more brands adopt this style, I'm hopping IKEA has similar experience. 

The store in thane had very friendly environment, they trusted customers and I've seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores. That's just sad. 

These Adidas, Nike, puma deserve this. Decathlon cares about sports more than money-making... I fucking love Decathlon. Amazing quality stuff at great prices. I just wish they make a shopping app. Or at least do something w their website. It's really buggy or something Decathlon, The Hamley's for Adults What's the difference between their dry, dry+ and dry+ breathe running t shirts? I heard great things about them from my buddies (so their word of mouth advertising seems to be working well) - will have to visit one day. it is pronounced ""di-ka-thlo"" if anyone is interested I just love Decathlon for their product quality and excellent pricing. It's my go to shop for shoes clothes and basic sport goods. 

I have met many disabled employees at the Pune store (and I'm sure they proactively encourage and hire) which really improves their brand image in front of me. Most of their staff is super young so kudos to them for employing out country's young guns. 

Their staff is excellently trained and helps you get the best item possible. Kids cycling and playing in store brings a smile to my face. 

If anyone from Decathlon is reading this - Thank you for coming to India! :) I love my decathlon. You can get some nice quality stuff for cheap. the store design is one of the best aspect of them. Explore all you want and buy what you like no interference from staff unless you need it This is really popular in hyderabad This is the place where I end up buying shit I don't need. Nike, Adidas, Puma etc. are expensive just because they want to recover their huge investments in marketing Do they happen to sell them online?? I'm hearing about this brand for the first time 😅 Decathlon is my prefferd showroom to buy shoes, pant & physical fitness related things This should be an obvious middle finger in the faces of Nike and other over expensive brands. Decathlon stuff is amazing value for money. Somewhere I read this ""Decathlon is Hamleys for adults"" Shower thought: Decathlon is basically Hamleys for adults. I love everything about them but hate their trail rooms. Everything is perfect there but why they have coffin like squeezy trail rooms? Mostly i have seen people who are into sport there 5:10-6 ft easily, i wonder how they manage in their. I am 5:9 and i find it really difficult to especially for bottom wears. I love Decathlon.
I also only buy running/cross-training shoes (or such critical gear) only from nike(or high quality brands).
It may make little to no difference where your shorts or t-shirts are from, but if you're an active runner/player it's important to invest in the right pair of shoes or equipment.
Sure Decathlon is amazingly affordable, while nike is exorbitantly overpriced, but there are clear and significant reasons to also get nike.
Foot calluses or even alignment and stride, or injuries are difficult to avoid if you're hitting the pavement or the treadmill for 10km 3 times a week. If you can reduce probability by even 10%, the high price is worth it. After they opened in Chennai I stopped bothering with the other brands, much more affordable imo.

But Hotstar is a completely different animal. 

First of all, it never remembers your video setting. No matter what you do, new videos will start at auto resolution which is probably 480p or lower. It never gets better like Netflix does, no auto scaling. The quality remains 480p. But then there's an override setting. You can select high and it will scale to full hd. But only for some titles.

For many titles, the quality gets stuck to 480p no matter what you do, no setting can override this. You can skip, pause but nothing works. 

So, is this problem only with me, or does anyone else see this kind of problems in their phone?

Out of all the major streaming apps, Hotstar is the only one without hdr, and it's video bandwidth is already pretty less (pixelations).

You can directly but HOOQ subscription btw I feel this. Cunts have the worst streaming platform. YT/Netflix streams 1080p smoothly but hotstar still buffers at 480p. As someone who follows EPL, I really wish there was an alternate option to Hotstar! Why is nobody talking about the forced cropping to 16:9 on every Hollywood movie? This shit sucks. Pay for hotstar and pirate HD if you feel bad about pirating. You've done your part, and avoided the shitty quality and logo that exists for fuck-what reason. 

And the content discovery is so shit. I have to check just watch.in to see what available. The top movies on my screen has The Hunt for Osama bin laden for the last 6 months. Is this a top movie? Who the fuck is watching this? It's a cheap documentary for fuck's sake. I have no problems streaming Hotstar on my Android TV, but on other devices like my phone and laptop, it absolutely sucks. And then broadcasters complain about piracy It works well on tv but yeah on android its the worst ,same thing for amazon prime Quality is good on computer but on Android it sucks...I sent them an email regarding this but no one replied. Even on HD setting, quality is worse (I was watching live cricket match at that time and it was 3-4 months back). And I thought they are providing low quality to the viewers without subscription so I took the sports pack but quality was still poor. Their iPad UI is equally shit. No PiP mode. Can't see the time/date while playing video. But their Mahabarath does not have Subs 😤 🙁 😭 It’s very apparent in darker scenes and you can literally see the pixelation in the areas with shadows. Also they somehow manage to fuck up the color and white balance. I mean the blacks appear dark grayish for some reason. 

Unfortunately it’s the only source for many classic HBO shows so I kind of live with it. Mate it's what you get for what you pay! Welcome to India....Oh wait, you're Indian...you know the drill! Their web UI isn't that good either. Do you guys get irritated by how, when autoplaying the next episode, the video player would exit from full screen mode. Sucks in android but decent on PC.
I got is only for occasionally watching live sports, and even then sometimes it's service is down for live sports like PL, tennis.
Content wise Netflix is the king(atleast for English content) [deleted] I use Hotstar everyday. My video quality always remains on high and I get really good quality. This is on the desktop site though, I never use the app. I feel like Hotstar's quality varies with shows and streams. Whenever I am watching a game or watching an English TV show the quality varies from trash to garbage. But whenever my mom starts watching her Indian TV shows, it plays at the highest possible quality without any hiccup. Hotstar is crap!

FTFY I doubt thats even 480p. Probably 360p at max. It also has the worst compression I have ever seen on an OTT platform. The blacks get absolutely crushed and the audio (specifically dialogues) often get distorted.

(I watch on macbook, android phone, and windows pc with studio monitors, and they all have the same problems) I have a 40 Mbps connection and hotstar works well, usually in full hd on my fire tv and pc i dont use it on android. sometimes it buffers when net usage is high but quality never goes below 720p Pay and pirate",2019-11-22 20:15:41

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.

Sportspersons should be encouraged by giving sponsors so they concentrate on game&not financial burden. All the sports in India other than cricket deal with this because neither they are televised nor they are reported enough. Sponsorship depends upon popularity of sport which is very rare for weightlifting. You know every player's name of a cricket team but not the same with archery or any other sport. And to be real Sports Authority of India suck's the biggest! Well the sports authorities are busy attending the cricket World Cup so rest all sorts can wait. When participating in international events, is it possible to represent a neutral faction/body, instead of your own country? Because if the country doesn't care or appreciate efforts towards it, then sportspersons are better off representing something else. If it's not cricket then India doesn't care, it's sad but true.

Mary Kom is just a rubber stamp for the RSS-BJP. This is why celebrities shouldn't be voted to power.

Translation: If I vote against it, I might not be allowed to  participate in Tokyo Olympics. 


> Her statement has not gone down well with the people from Northeast.

Her selfishness and stupidity would make anyone angry. “I am not a politician. If the Government has taken a decision then even if I request them to withdraw CAB. It’s not going to be withdrawn. At this stage, it’s not going to stop. If the decision is already taken, then I will just follow that.""

Then what are you doing in Rajya Sabha? If you are not even going to protest against wrong, than you are worse than the perpetrator. It's not just her,entire BJP MPs have same attitude more the half of MPs in loksabha are elected only because of Modi fame they can't win election on their own so they don't have opinion on anything just follow what party says play safe get in good books of the Modi.

""You can be the best sportsperson in the world but still, you can't be Mohammed Ali, he was much more than a sportsperson"" 

These sports person (especially Sachin) don't understand the thing that they are inspiration for many and if they speak about a certain issue, millions will listen to them and try to understand them. But they always try to escape the political discourse, this is very unfortunate, it's like wasting a resource, a potential.

Mohammed Ali was one of very few sports person of the world who was hugely popular and he used to protest against social Injustice (whatever his stand was) in society, openly criticizing the government. His followers would listen to him and his words had a lot more impact than an ordinary citizen saying the same things. Phogats, Deols, Kumars and now Koms.. 

Some fool said it right.. celebrities should just mind their own business.",2019-12-13 20:59:31

Preferably, with a budget of not more than 3-4k ?",Android_Arsenal," I don't think any reasonable shoe can last for years, nor is that something to be expected. They take the abuse, so your feet don't have to.

For example, walking shoes are expected to give out after about 700 kms, which should be about a year under regular use. Asics Gel Lyte would last you a long time. Also they're the best for running. Any sports shoe, at long as you don't use it. I have had Reebok, Puma and Fila.

All these have lasted for about 3 to 4yrs atleast. Never had an issue. ASICS Sketchers. They're costly but worth it imho very comfortable too. Been using one pair for about 2 years now.

Sports,Your thoughts on e-sports,52,bwkqxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwkqxu/your_thoughts_on_esports/,48,"I recently saw a video where the Danish PM visited the largest e-sports training arena and played Counter Strike Global Offensive (csgo) with their team.
E-sports has undeniably risen and still rising up to huge popularity levels

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

What are your thoughts ?",SlapMak," The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.

Second reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.

If we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.

I listened to a really good podcast episode between The Esports Observer and Akshat Rathee from NODWIN Gaming where Akshat explains the esports scene in India and also explains why people cheat. It's a must listen for people interested in the esports scene in India. 

Here's the link: https://open.spotify.com/episode/28MfL8Mf8tlwIqvqnUPM15?si=FRP1PciSTuCXZaqJOm4BWQ

Edit: The original link doesn't work anymore for some reason. Here's another link:
https://castbox.fm/vb/98895545 Will only get bigger. It's inevitable. Danish PM playing with Astralis (considered best CSGO team ever) was just a PR move around their election time. That being said, a number of top-tier talents come from Nordic and Scandinavian region.

That being said, a career in esports is still not viable even outside, let alone here. If you're not a talent in a top org, bills become hard to pay. There have been many instances where talented people/ teams had to raise funds from the community itself. I don't know about other games, but Indian CSGO ""pros"" don't have the talent like the EU players. They are just way better. EU just owns.

Also to make big bucks, we ll have to invest time and money. Especially Esports. Also doing it unless you are absolutely sure? Investing thousands of hours practicing? Do you think the ""society"" will accept it? They ll just brand the guy ""addicted to gaming, gaming is bad, it should be banned"". Crosspost to r/indiangaming as well We need a break out star in a competitive game(like faker or sumail) so we can kick start more poeple in our country. We have teams but they are just so far behind international standards... But hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade... In my local area, a lot of gaming pubs host DOTA and CSGO tournaments.

But I believe it's gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here. Unless people take gaming seriously nothing's gonna happen. Half of my friends didn't knew PUBG was a thing unless it hit the play store. I feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise PC gaming. ( My friends tease me for playing games on PC saying I have no life and shit and yet they play PUBG the whole day. )

Esports won't be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the Indian society. Our aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only. I hope someone revives it.

In the few years I've seen some really great Indian born games on mobile gaming platform. They're not 10/10 but at least they're of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpart.

Recently our college was creating clubs. I wanted to make an Esports club badly but I realized 90% of my colleagues wouldn't know its meaning. The idea got buried. Even if I did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties I want an Esports club and explain them, I m pretty sure they'd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day. The general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like Dota/CSGO to flourish.

We might have more players than Europe but the skill level is terrible I don't thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports. It's not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill Give it another 10 years and it will become an Olympic Sport. First of all, let [Redeye talk some sense into you. It's esports.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO8IaV_DAoY) 

I'm a fellow competitive csgo follower (RIP Astralis era btw). Majority of India has no concept of esports. I think we need to convince a certain influential Gujarati man to educate our masses about esports, because I see no other way of esports growth in India. Not in the near future at least. People don't considered gaming/streaming an occupation here. I bet most of the people don't know about joining esport orgs For e sports to be a thing people must buy the damn games.Excluding cheap and free games like CS,Dota,TF2 etc which game has a large enough player base to even ask this question? pc parts cost 2x more in India and people don't think its good investment. The reason why esports haven't taken off in India is that we don't have any fallback options. There are no social safety net and any breaks taken during education is extremely frowned upon by Indian society and in extent Indian firms. Let's say, you try your hands on esports, you play well but not good enough to make a living out of it. Then you need to get a job and that's only backed up by education. No firm will hire you if you put esports in your cv. Not to mention if you take a break in your studies to pursue esports, there's a good chance your cv will be thrown into the dustbin even before it reaches the interviewer.

The same is applicable for other type of sports. Football is very popular in West Bengal, but most players are struggling hard to make ends meet. If you've watched Dangal then you'd know what happens to Amir in the movie is a reflection of what happens to our society in general. The only two ways to make an honest living in India is either through education or through business. Esports won't help you in either in the long run. Don't you remember the PM referencing pubg? I feel that e-sports is pernicious for the society in general. It promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. Playing video-games for long enough to become the best at them ought to have a deleterious effect on one's health, both physical and mental. Even though I love playing video games, Sports for me is still something physical. Sports? Are they still calling them sports to make them feel and sound more legit? Lol",2019-06-04 12:51:09

East Bengal won the game 4-1 with Bhaichung Bhutia scoring a hat-trick. 

I came across this while reading about yesterday's match between India and Bangladesh where the attendance was 61,486. Probably one of the highest in recent times.

> It is to be wondered what would have happened if the AIFF, in a weak moment, reacted to Amal Dutta's suggestion that a foreign referee must be given charge of the match. And if the foreign referee, as Dutta wished, was a strict, unyielding man, the semi-final may not have taken place. For clearly, there were more people in the Salt Lake Stadium than the maximum meant to be accommodated when it was newer and in better condition. Instead of the maximum capacity of 1,20,000, there were 1,31,781. And the precise number mentioned by press reports lends belief that the figures had been given officially.

> Which means that knowingly, the AIFF and the IFA had allowed nearly 12,000 people more for the highly tense semi-final, an unpardonable excess. **The attendance set two records. One for the highest turn-out for any match, not only in India but also anywhere in Asia, and maybe anywhere in the world save for the matches at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

The coming decade was so bad economically that some INFL winning clubs would fold within few years due to lack of proper infrastructure of the sport and fanfare in general. The league barely got any broadcast and only Kolkata/Goan clubs would have any chance of making money.

This decade was a mixed bag, on one end people started taking interest in the sport but on the other end clubs continued to go bankrupt. Goan clubs are simply happy to play in the Goan Pro league whilst Kerala, Kolkata and NE are the only bastions of football.",2019-10-16 18:31:33

It may sound cringe but if you tell me to act happy or something, It would be damn difficult for me to even sport a smile ..being introvert is also a factor.

There are couples who don't even have a proper house of their own, yet they are confident and happy enough to make those lovey dovey cringe  videos.

If you have a problem with them, uninstall the app.

As simple as that. True. People judge tiktok users a lot though as if they are beneath them. Just like all social media it has its cons but banning it just because someone thinks its cringe is stupid. It is source of happiness for many and a platform to showcase talent for a few. One man's cringe is another man's entertainment. But sometimes cringe is so strong! It's unbearable. Most of them are novice Uninstalled all social media why ?
They made me feel how shit my life was, but in reality everyone has shit lives Frankly Baba Jackson is the only wholesome tiktok guy there for me,
Then there's Indian joker. Good help him. Many people look up to bollywood stars and want to act like them but they cant cause of financial problems.

[deleted] *Compulsory burning-in-the-heat-without-any sport-equipment-or-sunscreen period every day for CBSE studenfs. Our school interpreted this as a compulsory PT session and threatened to not give Boards admit cards to students who didn't want to do PT. Sports is going for the growth of our children. But the schools should have proper infrastructure. That's 13 years late. Sports period everyday? Not against the idea but we used to have 2 sports period a week where we were just left like stray dogs out in the scorching heat feeling free to do whatever the fuck we wanted (as long as it was confined to the open ground). 
No proper sports outfit, no proper sports equipment, infrastructure, most importance, seriousness. 
Schools pretend to be caring about a student's physical development. Rather than increasing eve frequency, come up with a well designed plan and test it for a smaller frequency.  It seems like only my school had decent sports facilities, and I used to look forward to sports period since it was only once or twice a week.  Sports aka second lunch recess/bunk period for anyone who isn't interested in sports.

Or stand in the heat for an hour so that you get a heatstroke while not even playing sports because there is not enough equipment and you can't go in with the athletic people.

 That is awesome! I wish I excelled in any sport! My school was an anti sport school! Literally! We had one sports hour every alternate week. Can you believe it? When I think about it now, my childhood sucked. Damn.  Sadly only 1 year of school left for me  We dont get sports are the parents to a fat kid objected Bc, first introduce differential timings, like in summer school should start and end atleast an hour early. Similarly in winter an hour late. Nice, new extra maths class (syllabus is not complete)  Good mine for the maths sir Laughs in PCM. Kids are going to burn in the sun. I wish I was in school now :(. I always loved playing volleyball during eleventh and twelfth thinking I'm hinata from haikyuu I wanna go back to school. Sports is nothing but throwing a ball and making a few guys run after it. I wish it was meticulous with training for the sport in question or as chosen by the student. Khelega India tabhi to Bahrega India. ",2019-03-18 13:53:01
Sports,PV Sindhu becomes the first Indian to be Badminton World Champion!,3475,cv80o4,https://i.imgur.com/aWXGxzz.jpg,100,,phantom_97," An excerpt from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu#Early_life_and_training):

>She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight. Sindhu first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy. While profiling Sindhu's career, a correspondent with *The Hindu* wrote:  
>  
>*""The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, travelling a distance of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment.""*

Proud of her, she deserves it ❤️ Yesss,This is huge considering she had lost in her previous two final appearances.
  
This is also a ruthless revenge for her narrow loss in the final against Okuhara in 2017 since she beat her in only 38 minutes! bless you, Sindhu. Wonderful effort by Sindhu! Hats off to Pullela Gopichand as well! Awesome she absolutely dominated Okuhara. 21-7 21-7 wow  thumping victory

Edit: (7:00PM) You can still watch the match on hotstar. starts at 2:23:00 mark 

https://www.hotstar.com/sports/badminton/final-okuhara-vs-sindhu/1440001984 Also B. Sai Praneeth won the Bronze medal in Men's singles category. Two medals in a single tournament. Thank you for making India proud Sindhu! She's a true national treasure This was one of the most one sided final I have ever seen. *Akshay Kumar has entered the chat* Amazing. Really proud of her This was sheer perseverance that finally paid off. Congratulations and this has to be one of the proudest moments of not only her life, but Indian sports as a whole. Not to forget, she dedicated this medal to her mother. It was her birthday today. Best gift ever. Congratulations!

As per the buzz Akshay is going to make movie out of this. He will act as Gopichand. Yay !! Sindhu 😍 Congratulations, golden girl. Truly dominant on court. Hope this erases the idea that she always falls one short from people's minds. Goodminton 21-7, 21-7

That's pure dominance! 

This one medal was evading her for so long, In 2013, 2014 she won Bronze, 2017, 2018 she won Silver but 2019 she made sure to clinch nothing but Gold...Brilliant and resilient stuff! 👏 [deleted] Her Quarterfinal round with Tai Tzu Ying was a hard fought win, she lost the first round, but went on to beat her in the next 2 to move to Semis. The last 2 sets were pretty close scores too.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcIcCyS-quU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcIcCyS-quU)

Compared to that she had fun at Semis and Finals. Kudos to the World Champion

Semis -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ZWgbo15Xw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ZWgbo15Xw) 

Finals -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRPdXM63Jwc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRPdXM63Jwc) Fuck yeah! Get it!!! Keh ke ley lee opponent kee😂🤣😎 pure dominance NOICE!! Yes! So happy! :D Woo, let’s go Sindhu! It’s nice to see her finally win! 

Quite surprised by the one sided score line against Okuhara. P V Sindhu <3 <3 She is gonna inspire a whole new generation, for sure. So proud of her.... to lose two finals but then win her third final and that too in such emphatic fashion. No words can describe her achievement. Champ🙌 Really a proud moment for the nation. This needs more coverage. Girl power in India ! Heartiest congratulations to this strong and magnificent lady! She's doing us real proud! Proud feeling for her 👍 Did Carolina Marin play? Congratulations to p v sindhu for making india proud . Congratulations Sindhu. 

Has Kangana or Akshay announced a movie already? Aye haye. Boht khush kita. Sohni kudi. Set 1 = 21-7
.
Set 2 = 21-7
.
P1V1=P2V2 ? Tight slap on the face of people who called her a chocker!! Modi 😎 hai 🤙 toh 👐 mumkin hai 👌.

Edit: /s -_- Cricketers can go suck a.... Not sure why we guys are so good at individual sports but terrible at team sports. And before you come at me, Cricket (a game) can't be counted as a team sport.

Congrats to Sindhu nevertheless.

EDIT: Thanks for the downboats. Forgot I was in /r/india. You guys can defend it all you like, only 12(?) fucking Commonwealth countries play the 'sport'. Last I heard, there was a commonwealth island where the WC (yes, world cup) players were carpenters...lol #THIS IS AN AD Easier to win over okhuhara at world championship than beating her at Olympics .",2019-08-25 20:41:16

I would like to ask you a few questions about e-commerce.

What are your recommendations for a newbie entering e-commerce. Is there still room for a small time seller to enter the market?

If yes, please briefly explain if it's good to use e-commerce platforms like Amazon and shopify to sell or should one open a website, add products and loof after all marketing himself.
Thanks in advance.

Sports,"17 y/o girl, wants to be a chef, parents stereotyping. [advice]",26,etpkb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/etpkb0/17_yo_girl_wants_to_be_a_chef_parents/,11," 

I've been trying to make a post about this for a long time now, i feel like i haven't found the right words.

Anyway, I'm a 17 year old, in a tight corner. So to give you a backstory, I love baking/cooking and people say i'm a very good baker. I'm also a tennis player (national level). And i do well academically. I've always loved experimenting with my kitchen. so naturally i wanted to be a chef. As a person into many things, i feel like I'm more comfortable with culinary arts.

And I've been trying to convince my parents to get me into culinary school. They are not obliging. They feel that their child is 'too talented' and that my 'potential' is being wasted on culinary arts. and they're being very stereotypical and telling me that i'll have to cook for my husband after marriage anyway. And that being a chef isn't a 'respectable' profession. This has been going on for around 3 years now and I've made them talk to people, showed them all the researches i did on culinary arts and the career i could make out of it. and all the colleges i could get into but to no avail.

Sometimes it gets hard. My parents aren't exactly the type that appreciates you when you do something big. They just ask me to keep pushing no matter what. That kinda takes a toll on me oftentimes. and they want me to pursue engineering. I mean I'm okay with it but its not my thing. Maybe they're doing this because of the sports quota. they just keep telling me that i should pursue a 'noble' profession and not culinary arts. either engineering or english literature/sociology and take up UPSC exams.

It feels like they're living my life for me. I don't wanna sound ungrateful i love my parents for providing me with everything but i feel like there's a hidden motive. like my dad enrolling me in tennis coaching at a very young age and he straight up admitted recently that he did it because i'd get into engineering easily.

And two months ago when i was on the verge of giving into engineering, i told my parents that i was okay with either chemical engineering/aerospace but that's when i realised that they were controlling even the branch of engineering i'm supposed to take. They were hell bent on me taking up csc/ece. so ultimately i started resenting them (not only for this, but for various other reasons too).

Each day it keeps getting worse and i wanna move away for college and take up culinary arts. but my parents are so against me moving away for college . but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't pay my fee if i take up culinary arts. at this point I'm willing to move away for college regardless of the course. I feel like my parents are being narrow minded, the person i wanna be is exactly not the person they want me to be. The amount of toxicity that my parents are inflicting upon me is immeasurable.

If you've ever been in this position / have a piece of advice for me, please comment. If you wanna know more about a specific part here, ask me. I'd be happy to elaborate. This is very serious and I'm helpless.",hojackthewhoresman," How much are you willing to sacrifice to achieve your goal? Is your goal worth those sacrifice? You have a lot of soul searching to do here. If you let your parents control the very aspect of your life that you have to live with all your life then you will resent the hell out of them when you have a failure in your academic life or eventual career, which, believe you me, everyone does. 

I'll give you two examples here, both are of my friends and you can take from it whatever you like. My friend named Ashish comes from a Marwari family and his father is a sales consultant. When he was 17, he was adamant that he wanted to do hospitality management like his cousin, who was pursuing it in London and not become a CA like his father wanted him to be. He eventually gave into his father's wishes and pursued being a CA. It took him 7 years to become a CA but he eventually became one and now has his own practice. He earns decent money now, married but resents his father to this day.

The second guy, Nikunj, brilliant in studies, just like you, and wanted to pursue commerce to become a banker but his parents insisted he do engineering since he scored to high a percentage in his boards to 'waste' it by doing a commerce course. He never completed his engineering and resented his parents for it. He eventually got into actuarial science and flourished; eventually his relationship with his parents improved too. 

Take what you may of these examples but imho you do what you love to do in life. Money will follow you no matter what. If you love what you do and are good at what you do the money will come to you no matter what.

P.S : Your parents expecting you to cook for your husband everyday is beyond shameful. I hope you don't feel obligated to be the typical subservient woman that is expected in an Indian household after your marriage, if you choose to marry. This patriarchal shit needs to end. [deleted] [deleted] Two questions, how far are you willing to go? and how far will your parents go? 

The choice you are going to make is a difficult one. Whatever choice you make, it is going to define your near future (or maybe even far), for better or for worse. Talk to your parents about this. It is not only just what you say, but also how you say it matters. They shouldn't think that you making a decision based on a fantasy or something.  Don't be afraid to tell your parents what you feel about them, add on extra resentment to your feelings if you feel like it.

I'd like to assume they are someone who loves their daughter more than 'log kya kahenge' bullshit. At least, it was the case for me and my sister. The ultimatum to choose between their son and not talking to them for over 2 months plus not staying in home for more than what's required to sleep, brush, and shit sure showed them that I was serious with my threats. 

Indian society sure does teach their children to be a headless chicken in pursuit of their parent's dreams. If you think you need your parents, in the future, maybe consider for a second that you probably don't need them. I am going to go out on a limb and drop an unpopular opinion - you are not obligated to love your parents. You are not obligated to do shit for them. But they, on the other hand, are obligated to look after you. If they treat you like human, you treat them the same way just like any other person. If they don't, you don't either. I would 100% advice you to be as blunt as possible with your parents now. Tell them exactly how you feel not just about your career but also about your relation with them in the future, even if it sours your relationship with them now. Personally, it made the relationship between me and my mother a lot stronger than it was even if they went into the gutter a for a couple of years in between. Simple thing

Ask yourself is this something that i would love doing all my life ??

Even if this doesn't work out you're in a better place than a whole lot of people What's wrong in being a chef ? Sorry for your Inbox.",2020-01-25 19:10:25

Sports,India’s Sumit Nagal took down Roger Federer 6-4 in the first set!! Yay!!,2102,cvxqea,https://i.redd.it/yp1w5yi7ewi31.jpg,90,,babloopachisya," 1-1 after two sets but really happy to see an Indian playing singles in the main draw. I remember the French open match between Somdev Devvarman and Nadal 7-8 years ago.

The first two sets were really close but Nadal just upped his game and sailed through.

Damn, what happened to that guy. He showed a lot of promise. It’s an amazing performance by the young man. Showed a lot of heart. Surpassed my expectations.
Let’s see if he can keep it up over multiple sets. Move over Nadal, Nagal is the new kid in town! 

All aboard the Nagal hype train, choo choo! This is like teleporting to the final stage boss right after you start the game and actually winning with your shitty blaster He tried his best. Really proud He just lost How do we add a picture of him there ? Next 2 sets Federer has turned it on. Still much more than expected. He gave a good fight, but Federer just proved why he is liked the world over. His first ever set in the US Open and he bested Federer dayum. Hoping he would win the match was wishful thinking imo but this in itself is a great achievement and I hope he continues to grow. damn, Federer really showed him why he's the greatest. Props to Nagal for downing him one set out of four, though! Second set not looking good so far :( Google doesn't even have his pic Is there a live stream? Roger Federer won in the end. But Sumit Nagal showed if players like him are given more opportunities they can really defeat the biggest players in the town. Some good shots by the lad. A lot of credit goes to Virat Kohli... 

Confused? 

Virat Kohli Foundation has been helping and inspiring the youth of our country to follow their passion and dreams. They facilitate in providing the much needed help in preparing people like Sumit to scale at tremendous heights.., First Sindhu then this guy. 4-6,6-1,6-2,6-4 final score fyi Sorry, this feels like Ironman versus Thanos.

Can half imagine Fed say in Swiss accent, ""All this for a drop of blood....""

Well played buddy! The guy has the talent, great winner there! Nangal Dam!!!! Headbutting the  Grandmaster himself. Big deal. 

Great Job Sumit Nagal Damn federer is getting his ass kicked left and right last year and this year I wish more people knew about how big a thing this is. There is always a Indian better thn you. Really amazing Performance,feel proud as an Indian. Madlad I am excited that an Indian just 22 years old is showing so much potential but it would have been more glorious if his coaching would have been in India. only nadal or djokovic can match fedrrer Great performance !  The P.V Sindhu Factor Is Strong Lol Does anyone in India care about table tennis anyway? Really proud of sumit!! I wish him all the best! Super Sumit Nagal or Sumit Nadal?????? :))) Holy crap, this is big. Excellent! This is amazing stuff. Way to go Nagal, damn proud you. Ye toh bas shuruvaat hai, keep up good job! It's true though.  We have the most people in the world that deficate outside and on the beaches.  We need to stop doing this.  The internet has brought it to the world.  Im in Bogotá Colombia and was hitting on a girl and we met like six times then one day in front of all my new friends she pulls some bs up on the computer and shows a YouTube video of us shitting on railroad tracks... Like 100 people walking out of their homes to poo.  Everyone laughed at me so I just left Wow, nice going Sumit! shit I'm watching this now! Kid's got heart! Holy shit balls! hum indians choti choti baaton mein khushiyan dhuoond hi lete hain. Supported by VK! [deleted] All the big matches are fixed, they wanted to give some spotlight to an Indian so they let him win one set, but that's all they'll give. Oh great... Now parents are going to spend money on their kids tennis lessons instead of teaching them how to not public deficate.  Our country has the biggest public defication crisis in the world",2019-08-27 09:55:27
Sports,Not many car models available in India,6,ejtlnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ejtlnw/not_many_car_models_available_in_india/,11,"Was just watching YouTube when came across many videos related to German and US car makers like Dodge, GMC etc. Many of the cars released abroad are not released in India? Why is that? Like Ford Raptor , GMC Denali, Dodge Hellcat, Cardilac, Even some of the Models of Merc and BMW. What might be the reason??",AltruisticEmphasis," The Indian car market is very difficult to penetrate into. We want cars that are cheap to own, cheap to run, cheap to repair and still seats 4-5 people at least. Whereas in western countries, the market dynamics are twisted. In the US, for instance, sedans are most common whereas in India it's little econobox hatchbacks. They measure fuel economy in gallons and we do so in litres. We want a lot of features but aren't able to pay the price. Things like this is why a lot of car makers have cars exclusively made for India, such as the Renault Kwid. Most of the cars you mentioned in the original post are from GM - DMC, Cadillac, Dodge etc. To be blunt, GM makes atrocious cars with abysmal quality. It takes a fortune to repair most of these and you will have to repair them. Another issue is that most of these vehicles are huge and expensive, and a very few people will buy them even if it is sold in India. GM tried to establish a market in India with Chevrolet, but again failed miserably. BMW and Benz sell most of their models in India, but they don't sell most of their sports car line up because 99% Indians can't or won't buy sports cars. So, it makes no sense to sell them in India. US cars are garbage. GM had to quit India after trying to dump China-made Chevrolet Sail.

FCA brands like Dodge have poor reputation even in the US for reliability issues.

Even Merc and BMW dump outdated models in India which are prone to breakdown in Indian conditions. No market here. infrastructure is so bad that models of 90s or 80s of these high end cars remain no longer reliable I think some of these brands, like Ford or GM, lack the commitment to fight it out in a very price sensitive market such as India. Both of these giants had a go, but recently pulled out of the Indian market, if I am not mistaken.

The Indian auto market also has some shit taxation system e.g. cars less than 4 meters in length are taxed much lesser, similarly engines less than 1.2liter (petrol) /1.5liter (diesel) have a lower tax. The 4 meter rule is why we have abominations like the Swift Dzire, a top seller in India, mind you.

The brands you have mentioned usually sell bigger cars with huge engines and the small car with smaller engine game is not really GM/Ford's forte. Add to that the perception that American cars are not very reliable, and this has made it very difficult for them to crack this market.

To be honest, the only companies doing big numbers are Maruti (more than 50% of the market) and Hyundai. The others don't do much better than 10,000 units per month with their entire portfolios. Kia, with just one model, passed Tata's marketshare recently (IIRC) within 4 months of their entry.

The BMWs, Mercs etc. are great cars but frankly overpriced here due to the taxes and low volumes. They are typically double the cost here than in the US and we still get smaller engines with lower horsepower.",2020-01-04 15:32:01

TLDR, no one knows /thread Usually National jerseys are the colour of the National flag. If they are saffron or green it would look religion based, white is boring so blue is the only colour left after elimination. India is the only country with an ocean with same name.

Although would have preferred any Indian footballer, but anyways, when ISL posters don't give much space to footballers but filled with Neeta Ambani and bollywood stars, then why to blame a foreign league. What's wrong in this? More people watch Cricket so using Rohit's popularity is the correct way to help grow the sport. What's wrong with that",2019-12-14 02:49:03
Sports,COVID-19 - Information,1,fm9kmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fm9kmq/covid19_information/,1,"&#x200B;

These are the collection of data from various resources.

# Corona virus - What it is?

Novel - First time human immunity system is being exposed to this virus

Corona virus - Family of viruses with crown shape

**Symptoms**

Please **monitor your temperature if you have dry cough**. If you get high temperature & any of the mentioned symptoms in point 2, please seek medical advise. In a case, if you have sore throat , please practice social distancing and isolate yourself.

The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and  beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the  incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly  around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become  available.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are

1. **fever, tiredness, and dry  cough** (The AND is important point to note\*\*)\*\*.
2. Some patients may have **aches and pains**, **nasal congestion**, **runny  nose**, **sore throat** or **diarrhea (Apart from mentioned above)**.
3. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
4. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
5. **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease  without needing special treatment**.
6. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
7. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop  serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing  should seek medical attention.

**Spreading**

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose  or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other  people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if  they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

**Asymptomatic Spreading**

&#x200B;

1. If a person is asymptomatic, it is highly that he is not communicating the disease till he follows a good personal hygiene.

The main way the disease spreads is **through respiratory droplets**  expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with  COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the  early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19  from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel  ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of  COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings. 

# How to protect yourself

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

&#x200B;

1. **WASH your hands** : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
2. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from  their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you  can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person  coughing has the disease.
3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?  Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,  hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,  the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
4. Make sure  you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This  means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when  you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?  Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you  protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and  COVID-19.
5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever,  cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in  advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why?  National and local authorities will have the most up to date information  on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.  This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other  infections.
6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19  hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading  widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are  an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
7. Self - isolation period should be 5-14 days.[Guidelines for Home Quarantine](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Guidelinesforhomequarantine.pdf)
8. Please call ahead if you are visiting a doctor.

**Please make sure if you use mask , you know how to handle it. Incorrect handling and using of mask will lead you in troubles (touching front of the mask, not disposing it , touching mask again and again to adjust it)**

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially  coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable  face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after  someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide  shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)).

The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are  to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow  or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from  people who are coughing or sneezing. See  [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information.

Guidelines for home qurantine

## Recommendations for travelers

It is prudent  for travelers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas,  in particular for elderly travelers and people with chronic diseases or  underlying health conditions.

General recommendations for  personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one  meter from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for  all travelers. These include:

* Perform hand hygiene  frequently, particularly after contact with respiratory secretions. Hand  hygiene includes either cleaning hands with soap and water or with an  alcohol-based hand rub. Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred if hands  are not visibly soiled; wash hands with soap and water when they are  visibly soiled;
* Cover your nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or  paper tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing immediately of the  tissue and performing hand hygiene;
* Refrain from touching mouth and nose;
* A  medical mask is not required if exhibiting no symptoms, as there is no  evidence that wearing a mask – of any type – protects non-sick persons.  However, in some cultures, masks may be commonly worn. If masks are to  be worn, it is critical to follow best practices on how to wear, remove  and dispose of them and on hand hygiene after removal (see [Advice on the use of masks](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1269003/retrieve))

As for any travel, travelers are also advised to follow proper food hygiene practices, including [the five keys for food safety](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/en/5keys_en.pdf?ua=1&ua=1), as well as [recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to human in live markets](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

# Actions taken by Gov of India

Now this is crucial part. India is a federal state and cannot impose restrictions directly as it is a state matter, until or unless Emergency is invoked.

Timeline of measures and recommendations to states:

**20th of March**

* Recommendation for implementation of social distancing measures
   * 50 per cent of Group B and C employees are required to attend office every day, and the remaining 50 per cent staff should be instructed to work from home.

   * **Youth and citizens are urged to become volunteers to support the government’s ongoing efforts in management of COVID-19.**
   * Ministry of Pharma and Consumer Affairs to take necessary action against anyone charging exorbitant price for masks, sanitizers, and other health related logistic material and to facilitate their availability in all hospitals and to people at large. They also directed that people should be sensitized on appropriate use of masks, to be utilized only when needed and to wash hands with soap.

&#x200B;

**8th of March \[**[**https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVIDCabSecLetterGuidelines.pdf**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVIDCabSecLetterGuidelines.pdf)**\]**

Some of the steps proposed:

IMO, if this cannot be backed up with numbers and is just your or somebody's qualitative interpretation, it's better to remove it. The danger is that our whatsapp-level people will interpret ""very low"" as ""no risk"" and say measures like self-quarantine and abundance of caution are unnecessary because risk is low.

PL matches, F1 weekend and ipl matches in that order of preference.
But IPL is being broadcasted on 8 out of 10 channels. I understand it is our national game /s and needs to be shown to gain the money through incessant ads during over breaks and the ""Strategic Timeouts"". But they should have left atleast one more channel for other sports. What do you guys think?",kaduajinkya1," After the new TRAI regulations kicked in, people only have access to either SD or HD. Before these new rules i had every channel available on Tata sky whether it was SD or HD.

Star sports is the most incompetent broadcaster in the history of TV broadcasting. First of all their channel names are super wierd.

Star Sports 1

Star Sports 1 HD

Star Sports 2

Star Sports 2 HD

Star Sports 3

Star Sports 1 Hindi

Star Sports 1 Hindi HD

Star Sports Select 1

Star Sports Select 1 HD

Star Sports Select 2

Star Sports Select 2 HD

and a bunch of other channels specific to regional languages. They were telecasting IPL on every channel except Star Sports 3, Star Sports Select 2 and 2HD.

On Sundays even Star Gold(the movie channel) is also used for IPL telecasts.

TRAI fucked over the customer when they decided that when you subscribe to a HD channel you don't get its corresponding SD channel for free.  Star sports payed a boatload of money(something like 5k+ crores) to have the exclusive television rights . They will surely milk it as much as possible. They are a  Indian company therefore its expected that they will televise content specifically catering Indian audiences.
I am not surprised that they have only telecast IPL in 8 out of 10 channels. But is F1 being telecast or not? It only starts at 8.30 PM. Even Hungama Tv for kids cartoons are playing ipl. Are people don't give a fuck about it anymore that the network has to Force telecast on every channel which aren't supposed to. As an F1 fan. It sucks.  Lol, today I was switching every 5 minutes between Star Sports 1, Select 2 and Select 2HD. 

Today they telecasted like this:


So Star sports 2 - IPL

Select 2 HD - Formula1

Select 2 - Premier League (Liv vs Spurs)

But they didn't telecast qualifier yesterday, I'd to watch it on Hotstar. You can change the language from English to Hindi on the same channel. So don't even need the extra one for Hindi. Just an HD and SD is enough. Cut the cord and get hotstar.   Supply for demand",2019-03-31 21:13:20

Overall, my basic question is can you watch live TV on Firestick for free. Don't think this is possible legally. But a guy told me all you need is Firestick and amazon prime to replace your cable connection.",kiss_me_or_kill_me," That's what I do. You need a broadband and a FireTV stick. You can watch live shows on Sony Liv and Hotstar if you get their premium and without premium, shows are casted a few hours after.

How is it not possible legally?

Edit: Also get a 4k FireTV stick or one with new volume remote. In old remote, batteries last for max 3-4 days only. Yes, you can cut the cord and completely replace it with a FireStick. I have done it already. It's not the best solution, if you would still like to continue watching live TV, but you can still make it work. 

I bought a Mi Box S, which was a better investment then because FireStick did not have Youtube, and no google services in general. Mi Box also runs the stock Android TV skin. The Mi Box S also has a built in Chromecast, and my parents are already familiar with casting content from Youtube which is really simple, that was the deciding factor for me getting the Mi Box.

Cut the cord entirely, and then installed Thop TV and Oreo TV. These are two apps that have live m3u playlists collated from different services. So, live TV is sorted. It's not the best solution, but there is always a stream available for any of the local Indian channels. 

The only subscription I am paying for now is Amazon Prime and Hotstar Premium. Slowly my parents moved away from the trash TV content they used to watch earlier, and now they watch quality content. Documentaries from Nat Geo on Hotstar. Quality short films. 

They barely watch live TV anymore, other than news. Cutting the cord actually improved the quality of content that my parents watch now. Get mobdro, Redbox and cyberflix. You'll cut the cable yourself in a day. [Here](https://youtu.be/VJNFp9j0g4U) you go! Amazon firestick by itself doesn't have any live channels. You can try Hotstar premium for live streaming Star channels and a few regional channels. Sony has its own app liv and zee has its own app zee5. Since you are using a firestick i am assuming you do not have a smart tv. If it were a smart tv, getting airtel Xtream or Jio gigafiber makes sense as they allow live streaming of channels on Airtel tv and Jio Tv respectively. Act fibernet was supposed to launch a similar service but i guess thats limited now to select circles only. Depends on what they watch. If its local content no, if its all india content or a subsidiary of Star/ Zee/ Sony which you can subscribe to then yes. Legally, tou can watch most (even south Indian) channels on firestick or any other android tv box by installing separate apps and subscribing premiuim for the ones you want. 
ACT fibernet also provides tv channels (paid) via their 4K TV box in Bangalore amd some other cities, that one works similar to cable tv, no need for separate apps. 
Between the two, second approach is easier for parents. 

Illegally, you can watch almost all channels for free with some android tv apps (wont name here but you can find online). However, these streams are not reliable, breakdown often, and apps are not well developed. Yeah, I think so... I use it with a bunch of IPTV players I found at https://www.firesticktricks.com/iptv-players.html and it works pretty well for me. I don't have any cable TV or anything else, just Firestick lets me watch tons of great movies and shows easily. I like it a lot",2020-01-07 01:15:20

Since I've a brownish skin color, most of the sunscreens I tried left a white cast on my face.

Currently using Neutrogena Ultrasheer dry touch SPF 50 + sun block. Unless I use half or less than half of actually recommended amount on face, it doesn't show white cast. But, this way I'm not completely protecting my skin.

Do you have any suggestions far sun screen that doesn't leave white cast and doesn't make your skin look greasy.",thaquiali," I haven't used any Sunscreens though,but my moisturiser has bit of spf protection.Anyways, What i have learnt is that anything spf20 is usually enough.  The white cast is due to the ingredients present in the sunscreen. You need to apply the sunscreen every 2 hours or so ,for complete protection- which is a big chore in my book. Amazon has the plum sunscreen some of the comments suggest no white cast after using it, for me iam using tvaksh sunscreen aaaa.... we need sunscreena?

isn't that for white person?

try nivea cream that comes inside a flat blue color metal dabbi. I seen my mom put that before going outside on her hands. Don't know if that is sunscreen or have the  spf and all 🤷🏾‍♂️

But if you want to absolutely protect from sun, use that white thing sports guys use, i think it will be more than strong enough for casual outing if it can be used in sports matches in afternoon summer heat.",2019-12-27 15:46:28

But now I feel that its literally dominated by Indians both home and abroad who really think that we are some world class superpower and no one can dare to harm us. Don't get me wrong I'm a die-hard cricket fan and love the sport, but even I can see that our team is not as great as its propped up to be by cricinfo and other cricketing sites (our away record is atrocious and we often get to play at home against teams like WI, Bang or SL). But that's the problem, we ignore all the faults and concentrate on small successes, if we want to develop we must admit that there are issues with our nation, I'm using cricket as a small but valid example in a list of much larger problems we are facing .

Further when I talk to my cousins who are NRIs and have probably lived like 2 years in India after birth, they always talk as if our nation is some 1st world kingdom and all those criticizing it are anti-Indian propagandists, we Indians (especially NRIs) need to understand that we still are facing a lot of problems and there is still a long road ahead before we are actually a superpower.",Rajeshrocks311," Cricket is there to act as an opium for the indian masses and not to achieve actual feats in the game, that is secondary. haha What are you smoking dude?

NRIs often have a warped image of India and they want to keep it so, hence the retarded pro CAA marches we hear about from overseas. Modi's reputation used to be quit high abroad as well, so can't completely blame them I guess.

Sports,Did you know?,1959,cawlif,https://i.redd.it/ex7u8k8vs7931.jpg,123,,AfzalOzil360," Inb4 people belittle Chhetri.

Nobody sane thinks he is better than Messi, but to pass the GOAT in a single metric with almost no support from anybody and playing in a tier 3 team is commendable.

&#x200B;

Before you rip on his opposition, look up Messi's world cup goals. Most of them aren't against top tier opposition either. Guys chill. Chetri is no way near to Messi or Ronaldo. But on an international level he's scored more goals internationally than Messi. It's just how it is. India is still budding when it comes to football. We're on an amateur level, and for a position like this, it's a great achievement for chetri and Indian football fans to be inspired and put in the effort like he did. This stat doesnt prove that Chhetri is comparable to Ronaldo or messi. It only proves how indebted Indian football should be to him. Actually yes Bro there is a little bit of a difference scoring against Kennya and scoring against Brazil, Don't mean to belittle our Captain but also don't want to devalue Messi. Apples and oranges. Chhetri is an asset to Indian Football but it is irrational to compare him to Ronaldo and Messi. It is true that Messi scored goals against shit teams but he also played and scored against strong teams under tremendous pressure.

Chhetri's goals have primarily been against tier 3 teams but they have been valuable to Indian football. It is about having the level playing field. And if we abandon that, then this whole thing has little to no merit. Goals against Bhutan in SAFF and goals against Germany in the world cup aren’t same. No I didn't. 👏 People need to get over him being compared to Ronaldo or Messi. I know we go overboard when an Indian does great and that can be annoying, but in this case, there is literally nothing wrong in this comparison because it's just presenting the stats. Nobody in their right minds is saying he's even comparable to either of them as a player. But to do this with the Indian team setup (if it's child's play to do this against other Asian teams, then other Asian players should be at the top, funny how they aren't) and to do it having a better ratio than both of them (Ronaldo 0.55, Messi 0.5, Chhetri 0.64) is commendable no matter how you slice it. Also, I don't see how you can dismiss Chhetri's goals so easily. If you can count Ronaldo's 5 goals against Andorra or Messi's 3 against Haiti, you bet your ass you can count Chhetri's 4 against Maldives. Especially when you consider India isn't comparable at all to Portugal or Argentina. This is not an accurate metric though. Chhetri is a great player but the teams he scored the goals against weren't exactly world class, were they? Imagine what Portugal or Argentina would do against Tajikistan. I don't want to be an asshole but scoring against weak teams is easier than strong European teams Honest question (I do not follow football at all):  Why do city based leagues like MU etc, do not approach Sunil Chhetri to play for them? We have got Chhetri ...
Sunil Chhetri.. I just don't think you understand
Oh when he scores
We go fucking mad
We have got Sunil Chhetri Congrats to chettri!  But the the fact is that the intensity of the game played by Messi and Ronaldo is way too hard than the one chettri plays in.  All I want to say is that this statistics is wrong given the fact that the international football association too knows it for real the contrasts of football around the globe in their respective continents. 
Cheers 🍻! Lol !  
Sunil has scored most of them against Asian countries!! So many people having arguments.

&#x200B;

The image suggests that statistically Chhetri has scored more goals in international matches than Messi. It doesn't matter against who he was playing against. It's a stats. That's all.

A proud moment Arey bc itni behas toh main muddo pe nahi hoti yeha jitni football pe ho rahe🤣 Let’s upvote so that everyone could know Just a quick FYI for those guys slandering chhetri for scoring against Small teams ,

 messi scored most of his goals in friendlies (close to half) and the competitive goals he scored too came in qualifiers or group stages, rather than knockout stages. As good a player Messi is especially in the club level, Chhetri's contribution to his national team is far better than Messi's. 😳 What Sunil achieved is unbelievable. 

Also, it's unfair to portray Messi as the No.3 and Rolando as the No.1 

Messi does so much more than just score goals. Only those who follow Barcelona, Argentina know this. 
This picture can be very deceiving for non-football fans. This is a cool little comic and I get what OP is doing for Sunil but I wish people would stop putting Christiano ""a whole ass rapist"" Ronaldo on an actual pedestal Did you know that this means nothing ? Why does this comparison exist? This is an extremely unfair comparison! After watching Ind vs Turkmenistan game, respect for Chhetri has been doubled up as I could not see any other player supporting him at his level.
Don't rely on Chhetri to win games for you. He has always done his job but you always loose when he doesn't. *Among active players.

Fantastic achievement still. Indian football's stalwart ITT : People knowing jackshit about football arguing He will surpass ronaldo one day so Ronaldo>Chhetri>Messi [removed] who are these people. I have heard of only the one in red.",2019-07-09 13:36:03

Forget Sonu Sood, who has apparently been diligently working on his own Sindhu biopic for two years now — when it’s about Khiladi Kumar, even Gopichand gets excited. In a recent interview, the coach said he thinks it “would be awesome if Akshay Kumar plays my part. He is one of the people I admire the most”.

She is making crores every month will they add it in biopic ?

India ! india ! nothing changes here same competition in schools colleges jobs and licking peoples boots if successful. Biopic is the new Cancer. What's worse is that half the things that they show are not true but sensationalized versions of them. No we need more Canadian actors making money off Indians' nationalistic sentiments.

Enough Kohlis, Hardiks, KL Rahuls and Bollybimbos! If Gopi sir doesn't have problem that Akshay Kumar plays the character then I have no problem.
I used to watch all Akshay Kumar movies as he offers different genres and I can pick an choose which one i want to watch,but lately I don't like going to movies and watching his films.
Even though he still make different movies with good concepts but lack of scripts makes them bland and cheesy.

Sports,The incomplete end of an era.,1433,cc7zis,https://i.redd.it/yduuz9txxt931.jpg,117,,rgaywala," Credits : Krishna Rathi

Original Post can be found on his Instagram handle : rathikrishna42 Is it really an incomplete end of the era? The man literally won everything there is to win in the game as captain, not even as just a player.

&#x200B;

Edit: A word Why do we expect the world from someone? He has achieved so so much but everyone will always talk about how in his last performance he didn’t do this or that. Sachin has to go through the same. Stop focusing on one thing and look at how far he has come in his career. Indians are just never happy, it’s sad. They do the same with their kids. At least give a credit who made this. Why did you crop his name. Downvoting as OP cropped out original creator 's name.. that's theft. Why do you have to keep reminding us :( Sigh..Does not matter how cool you are.. This will probably haunt him for years. I cannot imagine the plethora of emotions that would have been going through him since the start of that over. But, a big salute to one of the best captains and readers of the game, India has ever had. This is quite unfair. He'll be remembered as a legend despite his last performance Lol, stop putting people on pedestals. Not incomplete and no end either. 

As a batsman he has slowed down in terms of power hitting but Pandya/ Pant will take over that front (which they should have in the semifinals). He is still as good a batsman you'll get for No 4/ 5, still a fast runner and lighting quick behind the wicket. Like for Federer it's the outsiders who are waiting for the retirement non-stop.

It is Ravi Shastri we need to bid goodbye to and move on. Some people move on Am I the only one who read 'DHOR' 🙆 No its not incomplete. He gave us Worldcup, worldcup 20 20, champion trophies, he is the most successful Indian criket captain in History. He is complete, his era is complete. He will deserve farewell like Sachin whenever he want to retire Its not the end. He will still play in T20 WC. Sorry I read it as Dhor first r/DesignPorn Incomplete? Bro which world are you living in? Or do you have amnesia. He has won everything that had to be won in cricket. Only captain with T20 World Cup, 50 Over World Cup & Champions Trophy. Pardon my language but fuck you for your stupid creative. It's because of ungrateful people who call themselves fans just like you that these cricketers are put under so much pressure to always perform. What have you done in your own uneventful life? Have you ever thought about that? Have you ever completed anything worthy for generations to come? You bro, are shit. There's little or no worth to your existence. I am no Dhoni fanboy but your creative is just dumb, tone deaf and utterly mistaken. Thoda jyada ho gaya [deleted] Wonderful creativity. *an era How you say incomplete Bar bar yaad mat dilao yr. Seriously guys there is no fairy tale ending in life. He got out doing what he did best and that is all that matters. People want everything to be a bollywood movie. I don't think that Dhoni has to rely on some armchair critic telling him how his career was incomplete. He has achieved a lot already. I have myself not been a huge fan of keeping him in the team for the past 6 months, but you have to be foolish to think his career is incomplete. Dhoni is not retiring.

He's not. Okay!? Thats how Karma bites you... [deleted] Why tf is everyone saying end of an era? He hasn't even slightly hinted at retiring anytime soon. Is this the doing of his haters? It’s not the end. He s gonna hang around No worries, he will be there (next worldcup) HOPE [deleted]",2019-07-12 16:03:48

Sports,"I wanna follow football,where do i start?",11,ets1uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ets1uv/i_wanna_follow_footballwhere_do_i_start/,4,"I dont follow any sport which makes me hard to blend in at social events, i want to follow football, any suggestions will be appreciated.",TheSumMustBe7," You want to follow football just to blend in at social events?


Anyway, I'd suggest you to stwrt watching EPL (English Premier League) matches (Weekends mostly, on Hotstar or Star sports). It's the most followed league. So, you can google the fixture timungs of top 4-5 teams in the league. 


You'll learn about the rules slowly by yourself as you gather more interest in the sport. Also, follow r/soccer for updates on International football. 


We've got ISL on national level too. You can follow r/Indianfootball for updates on that. Just start watching games and play as often as you can. There's nothing like the thrill of being involved in a nice passing move like the one you saw in the match on the weekend.  
  
Good/exciting teams to watch in the English Premier League (EPL) at the moment: Liverpool, Man City, Leicester City.  
  
I myself am an Arsenal fan and I invite you to join me in supporting the club if you're masochist who doesn't have enough pain and disappointment in your life.  
  
As for other leagues, I don't know much. Perhaps others can help you. As far as I can tell, pretty much all EPL games are broadcast in India. Most La Liga (Spain) and Bundesliga (Germany) games are broadcast. Serie A (Italy) and Ligue Un (France) are harder to follow.  
  
I suggest you don't pick a team to watch at first. Just watch whatever football you can. But my honest suggestion is to not feel pressured into supporting ""local"". Your time is precious. Football, playing or watching, is supposed to be recreational and enjoyable. Watching 22 guys kick and rush and plod around a grass rectangle can be difficult to really get into. But if you watch high quality football, there's nothing like it.  
  
The channel Tifo Football on YouTube has some really nice videos on history, tactics, and current news in football. Maybe others can mention more YT channels that put out good content. 
  
If you're a reader, I can't recommend anything more highly than the book Inverting the Pyramid by Jonathan Wilson. It's a beautiful book that will introduce you to the history of the game, the quaint developments along the way, and some of the most fascinating and inspiring characters in the sport. I was already bitten by the bug before I read the book but reading it only intensified my love for the game and put me into a phase of obsessing over it.  
  
**Most importantly, I suggest you should not feel obliged to follow football because everyone around you is talking about it. I don't want to assume too much but the way your post is worded makes me think everyone around you mainly talks about football and you have nothing to contribute. If that's what they're doing then don't be hesitant about breaking it up and talking about something else which is of common interest. I've been that asshole who used to talk only football and had nothing to say about anything else. It's shit and I would have been grateful for friends who were willing to talk about other stuff.**  
  
If football doesn't catch your fancy, you don't need to watch it. It's a wonderful sport and I hope my suggestions are of help in getting you to love it the way I do but really, it's not the be all and end all. Most football bros eventually grow out of talking about it 24/7. Do what you like. Cultivate your own interests and introduce others to them like I'm trying to introduce to football. I'm sure they'll be grateful. [deleted]",2020-01-25 23:26:05
Sports,What do Indians think of MMA?,0,eot0mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eot0mk/what_do_indians_think_of_mma/,27,"Why do Indians think of MMA? The sport has the potential to mold the youth to defend themselves.

One experienced mma fighter can withstand 5 goons. Perhaps this is useless against officers who will throw you an jail but it is better than nothing.

Military training prepares you for the battlefield but how well does it do in the streets.",bharathk98," >One experienced mma fighter can withstand 5 goons.

Chotta bheem can plug a volcano with a rock, I'd say we should forget MMA and focus on analysing the contents of tun tun mausi's laddus instead. I don’t know if one mma fighter can withstand five goons.  A street fight with weapons and shit is a different story.  Dick kick and run is the best strategy.  I love mma though > One experienced mma fighter can withstand 5 goons

Uttar Pradesh: *Not when the goons have a gun.* You've never done MMA, have you? Any martial arts? Bas bollywood dekhke bolte hoge ki Tiger Shroff paach ko mar deta hoga?

Taekwondo learner

First of all, India is **not** against MMA, I don't see people lashing out about it. Its just its not been implemented well enough. Anyways we are doing pretty good in boxing, TaeKwonDo, ever local park I see has a teacher teaching some form of martial art to kids.

Is your problem that people are *specifically* being taught MMA? Well start and institute and start teaching people. Noone thought about it maybe? Oh wait you can't because you don't know MMA, which is evident by ""One experienced MMA fighter can withstand five gooons"" First off, take a close look at the name: **MIXED** MARTIAL ARTS. It encompasses multiple martial arts disciplines, three of the most popular being  boxing / kickboxing (strikes), Pancrase (grappling / takedowns) and Brazilian Jiujitsu (ground submissions).

Of these three, other than striking, the rest are dangerous (if not useless) in a street fight. In a street fight, you're looking to harm your opponent to make him incapable of hitting you back. Unless one knows how to strike properly and guard properly, he's going to get his ass whooped in no time.

Better to learn something like Krav Maga and boxing for self-defense. A well-thrown punch to the jaw is enough to stun your opponent, if not knock him down.

MMA is good as a sport, not as a self-defense technique. Go to Shakha, they will teach you MMA is more geared towards sport, in an organized environment, with safety rules. It no doubt provides general fitness and conditioning in addition to teaching the essentials - how to punch and not break your fingers/knuckles when you so do. To generate a proper heel kick without sufficient practice will end up as a joke at best and toe fracture at worst. 

Street fight is in a whole different league - It is Chaos. In a fight where you are not merely aiming to win but cause wanton harm to other requires an extremely different mindset. I can imagine myself throwing a couple of punches but I inwardly cringe at the mere thought of gouging someone's eyes out or a throat punch to the adam's apple. If I can't even think of it in a relaxed surrounding, I'm damn sure that in a pressurized environment, it will not even occur to me.  

Most fights are determined in the first two minutes. I have never seen or been in a fight that has lasted more than 2 minutes. Fighting is difficult and leaves most gasping for breath after the initial flurry of activity. It is never like how its portrayed in mass media or entertainment. Further, a lot of extraneous factors also weigh in. The punch thrown by a 75 kg fellow and a 90 kg fellow will be so different, its like the distinction between being hit by a car and a train.   If weapons are involved, no one can predict how its gonna turnout. 

Unless someone is extremely adept at a particular martial art, it makes no difference in an extreme situation. My friend was learning Aikido for close to 4 years and in an incident last year, I got a lesser ass whooping than him, simply because I chose to run away earlier when that idiot was doing some Avatar air-bending shit which looked comical.  

However, this is not to say that the martial arts are useless unless mastered. They have an unique use - you learn how to take affordable hurt. Someone who has practiced martial arts gets an intuitive feeling of where it will hurt less. How many of you know that a punch to the nipple, even accidentally, hurts almost the same as a dick kick ? - I thought since it is chest and ribs, its not a big deal. How wrong I was! While I found that out by suffering it, my friend instinctively knew to avoid it even though his aikido was useless. If a dumb fuck like me stands straight exposing his chest and stomach, they would stand in a posture which will present a very minimal area to hurt. He is still going to get punched but it will hurt far less. 

All this is to say: Never buy into the story that martial arts can make you Bruce Lee or Ip Man. Most of the martial arts taught in India are sport variants and mostly useless in close combat. And fighting multiple opponents is something which requires extraordinary skill and mindset. 

If someone thinks merely practicing MMA would be sufficient for defense, its a mistaken mind. It would be like masturbation - Provide you feelings of happiness, self-sufficiency and some endorphins but all you would be doing is fucking yourself with an illusion.",2020-01-15 06:49:42

Which is a local government body. The work environment is as toxic as it can be. The worst thing is that first I was posted near Nagpur. It was great, people were really nice and respectful. Then I got myself transferred near my hometown, Aurangabad. Everything here is bad compared to my previous working place. My current Boss is an unmarried 50 y.o. woman. She just don't have any filter when she talks. Very abusive and narcissist. I'm incredibly depressed and suicidal. I told my family about this. But, they just want me to get married and be grateful that I have a government job. But, basically I'm dying inside. I don't know what to do.

***

 I wanted to quit but, my father convinced me that I could just take leaves and prepare for another job (I can get another government job within a year. I'm in sports quota). But, now he don't want me to take leaves either. He just wants me to get married as quickly as possible. I was preparing for this another job (It's like PWD job). But, now this new Government of Maharashtra is thinking about scrapping the whole recruitment portal because it was an initiative of former government. I'm very indecisive and fucked up RN.",nikamsumeetofficial," Dont quit unless you have another job in hand. And fair warning, most jobs in India are stressful, especially in the private sector. I forgot to mention that I'm a 26 year old male. From *Maharashtra*. Exercise helps a lot in reducing stress. Also try to inculcate a hobby to just divert the mind. Fantasy novels are great for just losing track of this world and it’s bullshit. You have only one life, don't just waste due to the social and family pressure, leave the job, and try something which you will enjoy doing for your whole life. Do whatever you want to do.... Your parents will not be there when you're old and regretting of what could've been Any option at all to emigrate? Wherever you go in India you are going to face this issue anyway man >How to cope with the stress and toxicity that come with typical Indian working environment?

By leaving this country Why are you letting your father dictate your decisions? Take a transfer back to Nagpur while looking for better opportunities. Meanwhile can you carefully & secretly record (video & audio) your interactions with your boss? This is in case you ever need it as an insurance policy against her bullying.    

Given the current economic and unemployment scenario, I'd advise you to not leave your job unless you have a firm offer in hand.Till then you can try de-stressing techniques like playing your favourite sport,yoga,, or a hobby. They'll also prevent you from slipping into depression. If  you're feeling suicidal, please start individual therapy with a trained psychologist immediately. The psychologist might recommend a psychiatrist to prescribe medication if it's severe. There's nothing shameful or wrong about getting medical help when you need it. 

Your father is less concerned about your mental health and personal happiness than is about 'log kya kahenge' (T: आपले नातेवाईक काय म्हणतील? समाज काय म्हणेल?) because that's probably what he has seen. And maybe he doesn't realise the extent of your depression. What you need to realize, however, is that only if you're happy can you keep anyone else happy. Gray rock him while your transfer/ other job works out. 

I'd also advise postponing marriage till you're a bit more happier in your life. A new wife and in-laws will add to your responsibility and your plate's already full with your unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Also you need to move out of father's shadow and start taking your own decisions before you accept the responsibility of your own family. Or even that life will be dictated by your father's wants and not your needs.

ETA: added a few more thoughts after re-reading your post. In your place, I'd quit.
Whatever you do, make sure it's your decision and not your parents'. No options for another transfer? Or record her abuses and send to media. getting married because of work pressure is like watching Dharmendra's movie (for eg. Loha) to relieve headache from watching Govinda's movie. Find a solution, like transfer or do reverse eklavya. Make an idol/flex poster of her and take your frustration on it. Nothing works like money and/or recommendation to get transferred. don't want to sound rude but i think you didn't have a test of the private sectors which gives just a few pennies in return.

***if you dont fight for yourself, no one will either for you*** jobs in private companies are not different. At least you have job security in government job. Learn to ignore people. > But, they just want me to get married and be grateful that I have a government job. 

This made me laugh hard You are living your life or your father's life? You want something, you have to go get it. OP, not a good idea to be complaining about your boss on the internet, while using a reddit username that apparently looks like a real name. If your boss finds out you've been a naughty boy and telling strangers how bad she is, things could get uglier.

Sports,How to get into sports and related activities after 22?,24,ax8nb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ax8nb8/how_to_get_into_sports_and_related_activities/,41,"I am a 22 year old male and have recently finished college and started a job in IT. Throughout my childhood I have been an introvert, preferred staying inside my room watching movies and stuff. When I got into college, whenever my friends asked me for outdoor games, I always excused myself. I know this was a huge mistake as college gives you platform for learning these stuff. You can call it laziness or shyness or lack of awareness or some other reason that doesn't matter now. Since I have started my job, I have realised the importance of these activities and want to learn them now, but I can't seem to find any place that can help me learn all that at this age. Any help?",mindlessCoder," This post summarised my life are you skinny too?

Coz that's will sum up me. I suggest shooting

Edit: tartget shooting g fuckin marksmanship post. Chutya. Start running.  Mine was totally opposite. Till 18, I played Cricket, Football, Badminton, Table Tennis, Track&Field and Hockey (sometimes) and was into NCC. I was like crazy into sports, followed everything from nba to tennis to badminton to cricket etc etc. They used to air sportscenter on ESPN India @8pm which I would watch with full excitement. I played at district level and a couple of cbse clusters. So I'd say for my entire teen years I liked to play and be outdoors most of the time, going around, riding bicycles and doing shit. Well, sadly life took a 360. I moved to a different town, lost all my school friends plus went out of state for college. At college, all of my interest got lost somehow and done nothing except binge and sleeping. In other words, I turned into an extreme intorverted guy and felt comfortable around myself and started to grow my hair to look cool and headbang a little. Well, there's one thing that helped me by playing different games was fitness. Football and Badminton helped my leg muscles a lot and I think also helped my height ig. I haven't been to a gym ( to this day ) and don't plan to because I never needed to.
23 now btw. Life's been depressed for the last 4 years. I get emotional thinking how cool my teen life was. Now everything is shit. 
Good luck to you.

 I find outdoor activities useless.
Lets say I play cricket. 

While batting , I hit a shot. Some cringy kid shouts ""Oyeee abe shai se bol fek na yaar"". I just stand there and wobble my butt. I waste 30 seconds waiting for another ball.

Some kid does a good fielding while the wicket keeper shouts ""Are chaccha chaccha chacchaaaa chaccchhhaaaa. Oyeeee sahi hai sahi hai sahi haiiiii!""

Batsmen running with their balla and wobbling butt.

Ballers shouting oooyeeee after every ball.

Fielders clapping because there is nothing else to do.

Outdoor activities are super mega cringy for me. I feel like smashing my bat on the face of every player that shouts or claps because he has to do ""something"" and can not stand idle. Starting off is the hardest part. Pick a sport and try to get into it. You should be able to find Badminton, Tennis, Cricket academies fairly easily. Find a sports complex or the kind. Or move to a building with a clubhouse. That'll be a good start. 

I'd recommend gym but typical Indian gyms are filled with steroid junkies and steroid recommending trainers specially when you're skinny.

I have recently started learning Badminton. The fuckers who play well try to fuck with you showing their game off, the best way is to not lose your will to learn and focus on getting as good as them and bearing them. 

I know people who started learning tennis when I played fairly Well and started bearing me in 7-8 months.

There are good technical guides to each sport online. By saying that 22 y/o is too late to start playing is a very lame excuse. Get your lazy ass up and start playing a game in which you have interest. You can start with TT, badminton etc.

I am assuming you don't go to gym so you can start focusing on your physique by joining a gym, first few weeks would be tough but once you get past it then it will get easier.

But seriously dude, GET YOUR LAZY ASS TO WORK Try Playo app.. The more you play the quickly you learn... Also, you can play Squash.. It is one of the few games which you can learn playing solo...  OP, first of all why do you want to get into sports? You say you have realized it is important. I don't deny the benefits, but what is your end goal?

Is it something specific like playing at a professional level or just something to keep you active and engaged?

If it is the latter, learn like how a child would. Just by playing it for fun. Find some of your colleagues who'd go for playing sports and ask them to tag you along for a game. Regularly do that. You will not only learn the sport gradually, but you'll have fun doing it as well. Not to mention that it will vastly improve your social circle.  Really depends on where you're from but there's always coaching centers for most sports. No age is too late to join these classes. My uncle started Table Tennis coaching at 40 years age and now he's addicted to it. You gotta spend money but that money is definitely worth it in the long run. What do u like to do most? If u like cricket, hang out near cricket grounds and start talking to them. They can always use an extra player. Same with any other sports. 

If u don't ask, u wont get it. Start making progress little by little. 22 is still young to give up.  Bowling. It is really fun.   Advice from 29 year old guy:

- Smoked from 18 years to 28 years. realised its a huge mistake and here is how I got into active sports.

- stopped smoking cold turkey.

- Started running, small distances and sprints. progressed and completed Two Half Marathons.
- Bought bike(cycle) and along with running, ride 25-50 kms. If you can't bike daily, then on weekend ride 30-50kms. It looks daunting but your legs will get used to it.
- Start Badminton.
- Start Swimming.

Schedule:

- 2-3 times running
- 1-2 times Badminton
- 1-2 times Bike
- 1-2 times swimming

Now start looking into Marathons/Dualthon/Traithlon. Forget social media and open account in starva, follow people and sync your activities there.

If at 29 years I could do it, you are just 22 and can definitely do it. 

Good luck.  Honestly it'll be very tough for you to get into a sport at this age. I assume you'd want to play with people your age cause it'll be weird for you to play with school kids right. Unfortunately most people your age would be those who actively enjoy the sport and have been playing for many years. They'll be way better than a noob and you won't be able to develop your skills to a good enough level to enjoy playing with them.",2019-03-04 23:58:26

Ok. Not worth wasting any time arguing this. Some people are just too far gone. >Reputed exam






Ight imma head out Lol, i have a felling that this guy is a sample for the coming sanghi white washing. More about 'Tenali Pariksha':

>Tenali Pariksha, Rajamandri Pariksha, Nagar Pariksha etc are the existing reputed exams in the traditional Shastra field on the lines of ancient system of examination. There is also a method called Shalaka Pariksha. All of them are text based learning and text based exams very unique in the world. The most important and highly scholarly fourteen Granthas (texts) are prescribed for exams in every branch of Shastra. Students are supposed to memorize every Grantha completely, thoroughly understand the important commentary of that Grantha and be able to answer any question on any page of the text randomly asked by the examiner on both the aspects i.e. memorization and understanding of the commentary. Usually it takes six months to complete one text in this manner. But the time varies depending upon three aspects i.e. the Guru and his/her teaching method, the student and his/her qualities and the daily time spent in the learning process. The most important two qualities expected of a student are grasping power and the power to retain it in memory. The process of teaching and learning has three parts –1) पाठः (Paathah) teaching 2) चिन्तनम् (Chintanam) students individually or collectively think, discuss, argue, question and ponder over the lessons taught that day 3) अनुवादः (Anuvaadah) Reproducing the previous day’s teaching in front of the Guru by each student till his satisfaction as a prerequisite for the beginning of next lesson. All three steps are mandatory part of everyday learning. The whole process is completely student centered. These three steps help every student in understanding the lesson, having clarity, registering it in memory and in articulating or explaining it to others. This three stepped teaching learning process is one of the unique features of the traditional learning of Shastras and this makes all the difference. Process determines the Product. Good for him I guess.. Hope he can get a job that pays the bills.. How does he plan to earn a living? Cool I agree with his wisdom. Both are systems of education. The fact that he wishes to pursue both systems is worth appreciation. A synthesis of two worlds. I mean if he's happy and all, who am I to say anything.

Now, people here really hate DTH connections and for good reasons, however those reasons don't apply for sports channels. You won't get ads in football, and you'll get ads in Cricket on Hotstar too. Further, the new TRAI regulations made packs costlier for those who want many channels, but really cheap for those who only buy it for few channels.

Long live humanity,long live Cricket . Pakistanis themselves trolled their own players sooo Indian trolling them is a given😂 Morons on both sides consider cricket=war. Fuelled by media frenzy and  past decade's  skirmishes between them. Schadenfreude.

Look it up. Human beings are cunts who revel in the bad fortunes of other cunts.

Humanity/humanism is a false notion drilled into our heads to keep us from straight up murdering each other without remorse. This enmity exists only in india and pakistan. 

Any other part of the world where indians and pakistanis live. They live like there is no war between them. 

e.g look at so many indians and pakis living in mid east. you will never see them fighting.

The reality is that its the politicians from both countries make it look like we are enemies.

Sports,I(21F)Can't decide if my bf(28M) is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enough,31,dup4ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dup4ed/i21fcant_decide_if_my_bf28m_is_showing_red_flags/,35,"Hey ladies and gentlemen!

I need some urgent advice about my relationship as soon as possible.I've been a member of this subreddit for quite sometime now,and I've noticed you guys giving awesome advice to eachother.

I(21F) met my boyfriend(28M) an year and a half ago.Basically,I signed up on a dating site for the first time ever and deactivated it within 3 days.He saw me on there and found me on facebook.We chatted for a bit and he asked me out.He's met my dad and I've met his mom and we are both serious about getting married in the near future.

So I'm from a South Asian Muslim background and he's from a south asian hindu background.He's not religious at all,I am a bit religious,not too much though,and the religious differences don't bother me a bit.

Last year,my boyfriend/s coworker/female friend had a bad date(she invited a guy to her place,got drunk,he wanted to have sex and she refused,so he left).She asked my bf to hangout with her at 3 am on the same night because she was upset her date left.He told me about this and went to her place,then they went to the beach.I got uncomfortable and asked my bf if I could speak to her.He told me I could message her on fb and I did,politely asking her about what happened that night.She got really upset,made a very racist comment about me to my bf and after replying ""Nothing happened.We just hung out.He's a friend of mine"" blocked me.Then she kept texting my bf to ask how I'm doing(my boyfriend told me).I asked him why he didn't defend me and he said ""I couldn't attack her because she is a girl.I didn't want to make things awkward at office"".

I asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed.She's still following him on instagram though.

So,here's the thing.Whenever I've brought up any concerns regarding this relationship in the past,my boyfriend has done all he could to ease my mind.Recently,he made a new group of friends he plays sports with every weekend.They're all Indian,so my bf gets along with them really well.They've begun to invite him out to bars and nightclub parties almost every week now.Last weekend,they invited him to a bollywood party at a nightclub in LA.The guys went with their girlfriends,and my bf knew very well I couldn't accompany him since I live at home with my parents and I'm not allowed to go out to clubs and bars until I have my own place.He asked me if I'm okay with it and I told him to go and have fun.He then told me all about how his friends got black out drunk.

Also,Him and a good college friend of his vacationed in las vegas last year for a weekend.Before he left,he kept telling me his friend was going to hire an escort and visit strip clubs(bf said the most he'd do is probably get a lap dance at a strip club just for his friend).They rented a car together and bf told me his friend wants to pick up girls in the ferrari.Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.Once he got back I asked him about his trip and he didn't mention escorts or strip clubs.I asked him about his friend and he said his friend didn't get an escort.

My bf just told me yesterday that he's planning on spending new year's eve with the same friend this year in miami.I am very concerned because I honestly don't think this friend is a good influence.I haven't brought this up to my bf yet.

I've just been thinking about this alot lately.Do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend's place until 3 am at night doing sheesha/hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until 4 am and vacationing in Las Vegas is a good idea?Is this lifestyle common for people in the United States?Am I being too conservative/inflexible?

Any advice,or your thoughts,anything at all would really help!

Tl;dr Can't decide if my bf is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enough",sabthefabk," You two are not a match.

There is nothing wrong in your expectations, or his behaviour. They are all choices people make. He seems certain about what he wants. You too, are certain, and when he crosses those lines, you are uncomfortable.

A relationship is about compromise. But compromise even if grudging initially, has to finally become one of happy acceptance. Otherwise, the insecurities will eat away at it slowly. He doesn't seem to be particularly compromising to me. You seem to be compromising, but very uncomfortably.

If possible, meet a therapist. Have a few sessions. A good therapist helps you clarify your own feelings and communicate them to yourself. That will help you decide. Is r/India going to be a relationship consultancy sub? Wow, this is a toughie.

Your insecurity is very valid, but at the same time, I can't really see anywhere your boyfriend incurred any serious red flags.

I'm sorry about the way his female friend / coworker treated you, that isn't right and you were right to ask him to not meet with her anymore (I would never date anyone whose friends gave me any racist comments of any kind, and I'm sure it wasn't in a joking manner). So kudos on that, and as for the instagram thing, I wouldn't worry too much unless he is known to be very active on Instagram (many people just have the app installed and look at it from time to time, not really paying attention to who they follow or who is following them).

Here is where the real advice for you lies:

When your boyfriend was vacationing in Las Vegas for hiring escorts and visiting strip clubs, you said, in your own words, and I quote: ""Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.""

I can understand giving your partner space, but giving your boyfriend permission to go to a strip club even if it makes you uncomfortable reeks of insecurity. If giving your boyfriend permission to go to a strip club makes you uncomfortable (I would very much be uncomfortable with my partner going to a strip club, even with friends) then ask him to stop (this is a very legitimate request and especially more so in your case, since you two are thinking of getting married soon).

Going forward, I would ask what your boyfriend is doing in Miami (as well as any situation), and I want to ask yourself:

Am I uncomfortable with where my boyfriend is going and what he is doing? If yes, why?

If you have a legitimate reason (hint: escorts and strip clubs are very much a legitimate reason).

Then address it to him in a clear, straightforward manner. Remember, communication is key in relationships and marriages.

As for whether your boyfriend's friend is a good influence or not, it's tricky (namely because you may not like the lifestyle, but the other party is free to make their own choices), because on one hand, you may think they aren't, but another hand, you don't want to overstep your boundaries (telling your partner that a friend is a bad influence can be seen as controlling unless the friend has been known to inflict emotional and / or physical pain on your partner). So I wouldn't worry too much (about the friend) until the friend puts a strain on your relationship (which makes it pertinent to discuss what you think about him).

So going forward, I would advise you communicate to your partner about how you feel where he is going and what he is doing, don't be afraid to have a discussion on it.

Communicate. Communicate. Communicate. He seems to simply be from a more.....liberal(?) background than you. There will be unavoidable culture shock involved.

Just ask yourself whether you can tolerate it, then discuss it with your fiance. Following that, you may also talk to your own friends and family to ease matters.

And good luck. :) Now is the time to contemplate and avoid any forseeable emotional trauma. It is difficult to understand what your or your bf thinks since its not clear of both of u are born and bought up in US or born in India and are living in US for last few years or born in Indian and moved to US as child. That defines the characteristics and let other understand the mentality.

As an Indian guy living in US, it is common to be attracted to the western culture and be able to be a part of it. Getting a lap dance is a common practice but escort is not. When a bf or gf starts making comments on things that their partner hadn't thought about, it is normal for your partner to panic. He might genuinely being a friend with that woman and your comment(s) may made him think you were narrow minded that led him to not tell you everything.

That being said, these type of situations are typically paradox for not knowing the other end of story. The best I can or I believe anyone can suggest is to express yourself and how you feel to your bf. If you've had enough understanding of him, you'd feel or realize if there was a lie. Just don't jump onto any conclusions. Do your best to understand what he's really doing. You're not ready to be married.

Enjoy life, try to find someone who is matching you. Who goes to Vegas on vacation and doesn't go to a strip club? What is this world coming to? > I asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed.

Which is good

> Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.... My bf just told me yesterday that he's planning on spending new year's eve with the same friend this year in miami.

Well, you didnt tell him not to so he didnt.

I guess you wanted him to realize that you want him to stop, by himself. That hasnt happened. You should say so.

I dont see any red flags tbh. But, for someone living in the west you are pretty conservative. He isnt as conservative. And that makes for a bad match. OP, do you really want to spend your life worried that your partner might cheat on you? There are plenty of decent human beings (like your partner, I’ll assume it’s a good person with a different lifestyle), who may lead life the way you do. 

&#x200B;

You are 21. You are going to spend hours and hours in a high-pressure job. No one is forcing you to marry someone who’s lifestyle doesn’t work for you, so why do this to yourself? It’s only a matter of time before you start getting gaslight for felling the way you feel. Why put your future at risk?

&#x200B;

Being a hardworking person with different interests is fantastic. Best of luck. You guys have a communication problem. 

Me and my SO are opposites. But we got through stuff by being straight forward with each other. But politely. Not  “how dare you go to strip club..”

But “I’d really appreciate it if you wouldn’t go. I feel disrespected .....” This is bullshit! You posted a Similar story a few months back! I actually DM'd you to give you advice on multiple occasions. What is your problem? Do you just wan the attention. Seek therapy I maybe sounding too judgmental but looks like you've had a sheltered social life. Your 20s are your time to live and do crazy things. Going out till 3AM, partying etc., this is what most people in their 20s do (at least those who live in cities), let alone in the States. You don't seem to do any of that and have perceived notions of what partying entails.

> Do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend's place until 3 am at night doing sheesha/hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until 4 am and vacationing in Las Vegas is a good idea?

Having a good time doesn't make you a bad person. 
Also, have you even talked about marriage or is this all in your head ?

You need to realize why you're uncomfortable with all this. Do you not trust him which makes you imagine bad scenarios in your head ? 

With the girl scenario, nothing good will come out of being too controlling. It's frankly quite unattractive. If he does indeed like her would you want to be with him ? If he does indeed like you then he will automatically draw the boundary when required. You need to be secure and let the chips fall how they will.

Also, try to go out more. It's fun. Keep All options open. If he is playing you on reserve and not curbing his activities. Why don't you try find a better alternative?
He is immature for sure. Plus the religion card always looms ahead for argument sakes.
Be brave confront him, sound your ideas to him. If he doesn't love you enough then why marry someone like that?",2019-11-11 15:42:23

They will restore the picture by adding color and stuff. Make the memory of your grandfather more vivid. [deleted] We do have amazing sports of our own we need modernization of our sports to bring them up front of Indian People for appreciation. Because shows like India's got talent just undermine our home talents. What is the Political angle in this, apart from the existence of Pandit Nehru in the Photograph? Is the presence of a Political figure, enough to consider a post as Political?

Mallakhamb is actually fucking hard as a sport, and kudos to all those who won the numerous competitions and helped keep this display of gymnastic prowess alive till present day. Good ol days Mudi kaka wants to know your location r/OldSchoolCool This is why India lost the world cup
/S r/oldindia Old school cool, baby. What's Mallakhamb? First time hearing about it. Is it like wrestling What is that mallakhamb competition? Fantastic! A real treasure for you! Which place is this?

&#x200B;

Just curious -- do you also practise Mallakhamb? I have two jokes here

1. Wow pandit nehru looking fabulous after winning a mallakhamb competition with that Gandhi topi

2. I am surprised how pandit nehru didnt shove the guys out of himself and the camera Wow thats a rare photo to be seen! Just for curiosity which place is this!",2019-07-21 14:23:36
Sports,"As an NRI, my personal view on the Serious emigration thread.",77,ddoz4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ddoz4c/as_an_nri_my_personal_view_on_the_serious/,87,"Here is the original thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcquo0/serious_emigration_threat_is_it_helpless_yet/

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

Edit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!

Edit: If anyone needs help with any issues like job, education just message me. I would be happy to help.",ppcontentrobot," Awesome answer dude. You've put every point so precisely and there's no counter to any of that.

But, 'why would I come back to the place?' I'd give my answer to this. 

Because I am one of the few people who understand these issues.

Because I have power to solve one of these issues atleast to a tiny extent.

Because India sucking is as much a fault of the knowledged staying silent as that of the stupid ruling the roost.

(Bollywood answer alert!) Because it is my place! How many ever years I stay in any country, I wouldnt be considered as a localite. I wouldn't be able to say that this is my country. You said you are 28 and you have been in Germany for 8+ years, did you go there for your bachelors' degree? If yes, was the education free for bachelors'? 

Also, why doesn't Germany have a provision that parents of German(immigrant) citizens can also get German citizenship, like Canada?


Also, how is the treatment of Muslims in Germany, cause I heard the right wing is getting stronger there? Re Indian mangoes banned, it [was EU wide](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/fMXWwNQ0ZCL5ZjVAoGyhGI/EU-agrees-to-lift-import-ban-on-Alphonso-mangoes.html). There was also a ban on some vegetables which remained in place. Same reason: too much pesticide.

There have been similar alerts in [the UAE](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/uae-alert-over-pesticides-in-food-from-india-1.191984) and even the Indian press has [published stories](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/chemical-concoction-pesticides-in-veggies-and-fruits-harm-hyderabad-children/articleshow/65126763.cms) about it. Indians feel like people owe something to you. Indians take things personally. Like a comment here, a service would be considered as help and refused. When a service is refused - you know what it means. 

Fortunately, a service isn’t interpreted as help and thus not refused (as much as it is in India) abroad. I’ve noticed this and that’s just my two cents. The mentality of the people should change. Hyderabad doesn't have GEZ fee .... Germany has 😂😂 Nice post and agree with you. Currently living in South East Asia and I always want to move to Europe because of various reasons but the salaries and the taxes always make me think. Interesting read, OP.

I am curious, what is the status of racism against brown people in Germany considering the fact that there's been a sudden inflow in refugees over the past two years? 

Also, how long did it take you to get fluent in German? [deleted] Hi,
As someone living in Germany for quite some while and familiar other parts of Europe as well, which countries do you see having well established or a booming IT/tech industry at the moment/in the near future? 


Also, in terms of quality of life, ease of integration/emigration, and racial attitudes, and in general the culture how would you rank these countries?

Asking because I'm looking at emigrating to Europe as an option and would love to know your perspective. Ok, it seems like you're having a really good time in Germany and your quality of life is extremely well. I'm happy for you for that. You've risen out of the struggles of India and found some peace and breathing room in a more stable place. Good for you. I mean that.

Now, is it possible for you to return to Hyderabad permanently and still find a way to sustain yourself and those that depend on you financially? Considering you're a techie, there is a good (enough) market for software developers here so I think that is possible. If so, what is stopping you from doing that?

The reason I'm asking this is because you seem like an above average and sharp person. You've also had experience abroad which a lot of people do not have here. With all that in mind, your perspective and passion will be invaluable and the same goes for your siblings. If you're this passionate about your country while staying abroad, imagine what you could do for your country, your city or even just your locality if you were living here? So why aren't you here?

One reason could be that you really aren't financially stable enough to shift here, and that's ok. If that's not the case then the only reason left is that your passion is misplaced. You are only worrying about your ""home"" because you feel like you *should* or because you have family living there. When in reality you've subconsciously accepted your new home in Germany. It's either that or something else that explains why you're not in India trying to help with these problems you've mentioned.

See, all I'm hearing from your post is ""Please make the city more livable"". A plea coming from a non-resident Indian who will never go through the difficulties of achieving that goal (because he doesn't and won't live here) but expects the locals to do so. And inshallah we will do so, but not to set up cushions for you but to furnish our own cities.

Your post implies that us citizens are wilfully producing and promoting this black, ""shitty air"" that you mention when in fact, just in case you didn't know, we don't want this air just as much as you (actually, we don't want it more than you because we have to breathe it every day). This, if nothing else, keeps us motivated to change that and since we *are* living here we can directly try to change that.

So you can see why a rant about our ""shitty cities"" can sound hypocritical to our ears when we're trying to fix things here and someone who has just about none of a dog left in the race tells us to ""make the city more livable"". It sounds very condescending, like a rich merchant asking the poor peasants to ""hurry up and stop being poor"".

We're trying.

(And when I say ""you"" in this post I mean to point to every NRI that rants about the ""situation in India"" but hasn't contributed to anything significant to help with it.)

> do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope.

I don't know why I wrote all this. You've said it yourself; you only want the good parts without having to have worked to remove the bad parts.

---

Also, I don't know why you're worried about coming to Hyderabad as a Muslim. I'm not the most politically educated but even I can tell you that Hyderabad is possibly the safest place for an Indian Muslim to live in (particularly a Hyderabadi Muslim). If you don't believe that then either I'm wrong or you've just proven how out-of-touch you are with your culture.  [u/ppcontentrobot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ppcontentrobot/), I wouldn't disagree with anything. You are pitch perfect on what's wrong in the country and I wouldn't blame you for choosing a better quality of life.

I wish I could just raise a wand and change the way things work in our country but unfortunately I just can't. So, I came down here and asked the world what's wrong and how we can influence change? Jingle bells, I wasn't cut out for what came back.

**If there is one thing I am sure of, it is of the fact that we just can't keep doing this forever.** 

Things around emigration will change drastically in the next decade and it will no longer be cut out for everyone. I wish we don't have to wait till we get hit to reform change. But you will always be a foreigner there and never feel truly part of the country, despite having citizenship, not to mention the huge rise in anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe, which although brought about by mass immigration from Syria and Africa, will also threaten to sweep up well-educated foreigners like you.

The sad truth is India is destined for mediocrity, democracy is holding it back as it is susceptible to vote-bank  politics and nothing ever gets done.

China also has lots of different ethnic minorities (although not as many as India) and the reason they managed to do so well was because of an authoritarian leadership. 

India's inability to get a grip with the population explosion is contributing to much of this misery we will have the same population as China by 2024 despite only having 1/3 the land mass, we are extremely polluted due to this population density and it is said there will be a major water crisis in the future.

More than 50% of our population is in agriculture, this is completely unacceptable and farming should have been heavily mechanised by now and the people moved to manufacturing or something like that.



All this because crap politicians will keep their grip on power by gaining the votes of uneducated lower castes who can easily be convinced. The smart Indians will always view going abroad as the ultimate dream because they know India is beyond saving. It's easy to avoid dirt and walk away but it takes guts to step into the mess and clean it. But can you get chai from a tapari in Germany? 

From my experiences in Europe and Latin America, I prefer a life in India. Yes, it has its hassles, but everything is pretty accessible here, and affordable to everyone. I am not denying the downsides, but I would like to list out something that we want to overlook for greener pastures. 

* Nothing to boast, but I find the holiday structure of govt opportunities here pretty neat. And more public holidays. Private sector sucks, yes.

* I can travel 29 states, as diverse as Schengen nations. Just pack your bags and hop in a bus or train. You don't even need a car, even to go to the remotest part.

* No need for any language certificate to be anywhere or work anywhere, free movement.

* I don't know whether I would want to be another citizen

* I don't know about as many, but its pretty neat here too

* yup, no paternity leave here.

* exists here too

* Children can play with other children, and go to good schools as well. Might not be as extensive as there in curriculum, yes.

* I think you pay much more tax too, for social security, but way def a positive.

* Not great at infrastructure, but hospital and care are def good in my state.

The only place I felt like settling in was urban Brazil. Felt like a dev version of India with the most diverse and welcoming people I have ever met. Very interesting response.

Its your choice as to where you want to stay - Hyderabad versus Germany, but I want to ask:

1. What are the laws about spitting and littering in Germany? Did you educate your family and friends in Hyderabad about them?

2. Can you have religious functions in Germany shouting slogans in the street?

3. Can a mosque have loudspeakers blaring azaan 5 times a day? Can you set up a slaughterhouse on Eid and slaughter goats in the name of religion in Germany?

4. Can you stand and say ""I am an immigrant and a Muslim"" in Germany?

5. Did you know that the pollution you are complaing about comes from vehicles and people attempt to pay bribes to get PUC certificates? Try that in Germany too.

6. Can you get fake degrees in Germany like in Hyderabad? Can you come out after Friday prayers and pelt stones there? Can you tamper with your electric meter?

I have lived in Hyderabad and several cities in India. Yes, things are not hunky dory and perhaps lots of things can improve. Some of us are trying to improve, but you chose to leave and go away to Germany.

And that's fine. If you don't want to return to India in 6 to 8 years,  please don't. Just don't lecture us about how much Germany is better. Keep in mind that if the Far Right takes power in Germany, you'll be the first one demanding for a ticket on the flight back to Hyderabad. 

All of these luxurious things you mentioned are available in Germany because of under population and plentiful resources/jobs. That is how things were in most developed countries (US is a case in point) a generation ago. Once the population increases and competition for jobs intensifies, things will swing to the other extreme and quickly. Remember the country you are boasting about has a very bloody history of discrimination, and not too long ago either. Itna nafrat h toh yaha post kyyu karte ho? India should stop leaning into NRIs as Victims. Indians living in India are victims, Farmers, students, graduates, patients, average earning consumers. When will we stop catering towards whats happening to Brown looking people in America. 

I as an Indian living in India don't fucking care if you are fucked in USA. ""Dhobi ka kutta na Ghar ka na Ghat ka."" Your sorry ass will ignore this statement as well. So fuck you and your Anti India minds just to fill your purpose. Indians must and should never help you.

Our Indian Health care is fucked and has gone way down because Indian born Doctors in US study from India and performs a rectal exam of some white crack head hillbilly, just because his skin is White and beautiful. He never will chose to do the same for Indian sewer cleaner. The color makes a huge difference. Hence the health Care is worst and people in India die everyday unlike America. Cuz Indians are always there to cure White people in exchange of dollars.

Fuck your immigration issues. I'd rather have an hardworking illlegal Bangladeshi or Pakistani in India than discussing or worring about your sorry ass in USA or Germany for nothing.",2019-10-05 23:52:48
Sports,Are Indians just a cheap commodity to the world,110,dncd9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dncd9w/are_indians_just_a_cheap_commodity_to_the_world/,34,"Whilst it's nice to see India represented nicely in the World stage, against the tidal wave of memes about us being Gang Rapists, Street shitters, curry eaters and tribalistic cavemen (I can go on and on big you get the picture)... I feel people look at Indians as a commodity instead of as people. This is a bit of a rant, but I'll elaborate.

For example, before the last Cricket world cup, reddit cricket was awash with a few Footballers and athletes from different sports taking selfies with Indian shirts saying ""I support Team India"".

/Cricket was awash with fawning Indian fans. Granted, I know most will be young fans, but something didn't sit right with me. Its clear that these stars dont even know what cricket is, let alone there is a WC going on.... It was clearly just a PR Strategy. 
The similar thing was done by alot of companies when it comes to Bollywood.

I just found it soooooo patronizing and condescending. They know Indians would eat that shit straight out of their hands. The know quality doesnt mean anything but quantity goes along way. India has a very fad based culture. So consumerism of merchandise is easy $$$ for International companies.

I dont blame the companies, its basic marketing. I just wish Indians would be self aware and appreciate that these people dont give a shit about Indians except our wallets and want us eating out of their hands. We make ourselves look desperate and pathetic.",khilarichowkidar," Can partly agree. I mean look at those YouTube channels reacting to Bollywood and our guys go crazy. I doubt they'd even care but keeping shifting for views and likes. It's same with a lot. Huge population, uncensored Internet and those companies will mine is the  best Why do you think Indians are different from the rest of the world? Do you think anyone else isnt viewed as a commodity? Why is there a surge of Chinese people in Hollywood? Why do you think they name drop/place an Indian/hindi word in Hollywood nowadays? Why do you think Disney has some cringey social justice quips in their movies while at the same time the Chinese movie posters remove black people? You think NBA gives 2 shits about anything other than their bottomline? Look at how they placed a gag order on their players and staff about Hongkong but no such thing for topics regarding America. Being woke in USA gets them money and not being woke regarding China gets them money. Every person of every nationality is a commodity to these corporations, celebrities, politicians. 

In fact compared to the west India doesnt have fad based culture at all. I read your post 3 times. I still couldn’t understand what you are trying to say. Hopefully someone gets you. A lot of Indians are new to high usage of internet. People will smarten up with time. For the meme part.

People laugh all long on memes made on Americans that they are fat dumb clueless ignorant people.

But are they really?

People make memes that Britishers are tea drinking pompous arrogant fucks.

But are they really?

People make memes that French are dumbasses 

But are they really?

Each of these countries have noble laureates and some of the most Intelligent people in the entire world belong to these countries. 

So memes are basically a way to make fun. You can make fun of literally anything by seeing a subset of population. How much you get affected by that is up to you . I don't think a high achieving professor at a big university in US gives two flying fucks about what Americans are portrayed as in world. He is busy with his work.

Busy raho .

As for brands and all.... I am sorry to say but can you please take a look at some 'influencers' and young 'teenage celebrities' in US or UK? You will find some of the most pompous dumbest idiots that you may have ever seen and after seeing their brand endorsing you would wish that aliens finish us off with a laser beam. 

And yet people love them. Especially young teens and high school going kids who believe they are the next love child of Einstein and Brad Pit if they become popular in their school. So yeah we aren't much different lol.

Admit it. Youngsters throughout the world aka Z generation are royal idiots. And that is normal. Brands have been exploiting that mentality for CENTURIES.

If there *is* one thing that is cheap and make Indians a commodity, it is cheap labor and absence of enforcement of labor laws. THAT makes Indians cheap cheap outsourced low quality labor => modern day IT industry Why do you think YouTubers farm for likes and subscribers by talking over and ""reacting"" to shit like ""I can't believe this is India.."" or Indian cinema trailer... when they would never even think about visiting India nor watch the entire movie. INDIA IS HEAVEN FOR THE RICH AND A HELLHOLE FOR THE POOR !

People here are not shitting on India just for the sake of shitting.

The young person who lives in India, works to contribute towards the 7% GDP and pays a third of its salary in tax, gets screwed day in and day out. Its a daily struggle for an honest citizen to get essentials like continuous power supply, running water, decent public transport and roads. That's the reason he is frustrated and will be until the government and the system stops being a bitch of the rich and powerful.

To anyone who gives me the 'India Shining' gyan, I tell them to come live here for just 6 months - In a polluted city, travel in a shitload of traffic and pollution to a mediocre job and come back to sleep in a 10 by 10 room without fan because the power is out.

Once you have lived that life, then tell me that you are proud of India. Don't base your worldview on internet comments. Yeah well we are learning and soon we'll be more selective,aware and deadass badasses. If the countries wants to make fun of the good stuff that we have..like the food, diversity, culture and music. I don't care. If they raise finger on the bad stuff, like women safety, hygiene, corruption etc. Then we should do something and should try to make it better. I was interested with your initial statement, but then below the title you explain something different.

&#x200B;

Your title implies that the low income of Indians allow the other countries to see them as an inexpensive workhorse - for example in IT or manufacturing. I think partially this is true

&#x200B;

Your content says that people are manipulating Indians into buying (useless) products by using obvious marketing. I think that is. This might also be true, in which case it might be better to say ""The world is shamelessly selling their crap to Indians"" Dont form your worldview based on Reddit and the Internet. There are Indians (generally Millennials) around the world who mesh well within the local communities, form life long friendships with people from different backgrounds. Anyone who grew up in a multicultural environment will attest to that. Yep we are easy to fool. Have you seen those foreign YouTube channels monetising reacting to stupid videos of Bollywood, kollywood? Embarrassing ...self-flagellation max. 

Yes OP, you, and the rest of the educated gentlefolk /r/india are the iklauta enlightened ones free from influence of all marketing campaigns, able to see through the curtain of Big Corporations and their PR campaigns, looking down in disgust upon the plebeian masses that are blind to the evils of advertising.

So what if some people are happy to be marks for things they are fanatic about? >So consumerism of merchandise is easy $$$ for International companies.

Because we Indians are good for nothing. We don't have the knowledge to invent or create anything in our lives, we have been taught to copy from others. What the west do, we must do it too has always been Indian Mantra since Independence or much before that. Mahatma Gandhi saw that and tried to stop this westernized copying mechanism and tried to make us self reliant and creative. In his 1000s of speeches he didn't just talked about freedom from British, he tried to teach us how to never rely on the west and their style, thus he made Indians to burn the Western clothes and made Charkha as a symbol, to start with. But we never paid any heed to it. We always let Western culture influence us and in 70 years,  we and our entire generations have become an complete White Cock sucking dependents. What we should have been proud of we slowly rejected it and always looked at the West.

If Indians were really proud of themselves, McDonalds or Pizza Hut wouldn't have dared to have maximum franchise here slowly, cuz we would have already beaten them had we promoted ourselves. Cuz we look at our food and culture as cheap ( Vadapav, Chole Bhature etc) as poor culture food. We always made up our mind that Rich People consumes Pizzas and  Pastas. But little did we know that Pizza was Italian Coal Miner's  No-Option food and Pastas were nothing but Italian Grannies rolling flour into noodles and fry it in oil and garlic. But we made it look like this is what we will eat when we will become rich. But if poor we will eat Dal Roti. This is the mindset Indians carry even today. And I'll tell these McDonald's eating morons, it is made cheaper than a Vadapav but you pay 97% money on McD only on it's Brand name. Same with other American franchise as well. Yes Indians are that stupid worldwide and are easy to fool with First world brand names. Ambani will wear nothing but Italian made fabric, cuz that will show his Richness amongst Indians pathetic poor. Cuz we Indians believe that Italian Leather is world famous. Lol. Either that or you can look at us foreign companies and stars pandering to us because we are an increasingly bigger economy for them. It happens to China and slowly, it's happening to us. I mean, congratulations on discovering capitalism independently, I guess... what’s wrong with curry eaters!?
that’s the tastiest way to enjoy food with. This is a really narcissistic view of us. Fuck any one who has a problem with curry, curry is good.",2019-10-26 18:52:39
Sports,What is wrong with India? Please share your perception.,0,dts0e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dts0e5/what_is_wrong_with_india_please_share_your/,29,"We can’t deny how backward India is in terms of so many things, if not economically.People are sexist (would be an understatement to call them just that), they fight over religion more than it is healthy, there is hell lot of corruption. There’s lot more issues. What do you all think is wrong? The education system, the parenting, or the environment? 
Though India has the second highest population in the world, we are not doing anything great (Pardon me if it offended anyone). There are no big achievements in terms of sports, education, or music, anywhere for that matter. Are there no talents here?
Let’s discuss, we are the ones that are going to run the country in the future. We need to know what can be changed!",Shutthefrontdoooor," Resources vs population ratio is very very low. See mostly how insensitive people are to other people is the reason. I have observed how people have this urge in themselves to judge others and think bad of them is, and I too have been there. Being grown up that way, maybe everyone has. 

Parents are insensitive to their children, most of them just have them coz society tells them to else they don't give a damn how is their child especially mentally, when its college time they order them to do a specific course as if they know the best while they don't know a single thing about their child. Yes there is change coming in this behaviour but there is still majority who will say it's bullshit and they own their children. They say that their children must study what they want them to, score what they want them to, love who they want them to and marry. Their talent is constantly suppressed at every step to the level they just become a follower when they had capability to be a leader.

Man is supposed to be loved and respected by his family even if he beats his wife, shouts at his children, have no social life whatsoever and is completely not understanding. 

People say their is equality but obviously they have to constantly remind themselves which group other person belongs to so ofcourse there is huge negativity to question of intercaste or interreligious marriage which inturn is best solution to vanish discrimination.

Even our newspaper do this discrimination, just read matrimonial section there, women needs to be fair always, less educated than groom always, have to cook, and will have to obey the order when family says no to work and ofcourse has to be of same caste and religion.

Man and even women believe girls are to be controlled that when they ask for freedom they deserve to be raped. There is so much filth in minds of people.

We are constantly been forced to love our parents no matter how wrong they are, respect elders no matter how bad their deeds are and on top of them believe in God that he will do everything good. Well I can say is society wants us to just support and obey things blindly and most of them are pathetic. As a country, we are just at that stage. Every country goes through a phase like this. But we have technology. It's up to us as to how we use the tech to make or break us. I won't even say religion. I'd say the caste system is a really fucked up thing than most people realize. My imaginary friend is better than your imaginary friend Indians are what is wrong with India. Herd mentality with rigid perceptions I think you're comparing India with first world countries. And let me remind you that even first world countries faced these issues when they were young. Every country has its issues no country is perfect. Even the first world countries have misogyny, racism & rigging, etc. 

India is a young country compatriot. It's still evolving and rest assured it'll shed all those features you've mentioned and will become an ideal country.

Jai hind. My mom started clapping once the verdict was out. And she said that India belongs to Hindus and that Muslims must be driven out. I'm just speechless. I don't know what to do.. I told her that it's such a backward thought. She didn't care. She just sat down to pray.

I can't believe it. Ostensibly people also have a restricted mindset, they are not open to changes.Cant blame anyone though, we have always been thought to not do mistakes, to follow the rules, trying something new is at our own risk.People, inclusive of me sometimes, deny to change their beliefs that we have held dearly are have been comfortable with. Vaanar Raaj Religion. To many religious issues interfering with country issues What's wrong with India is that we didn't have a mass movement to get to level of high values of integrity in it's people, as a society. 

The same aspect for which the subcontinent was once famous for, before this country was looted, it's people exploited, before there were artificial famines where millions died, before there were foreign invasions, organized rape and loot. Societies take a hit in various ways from that. Societies tend to become misogynistic, racist and overly religious in such cases. Political games and vote bank politics from all sides don't help either. I not defending anything here, just looking at the psychological, societal aspects of it. 

Given all that, even though I see a lot of less than ideal behavior, in terms of sexist, racist behavior of people, I see that we are quickly moving to a more equal society, there is good growth.
Yes, there still are horrific incidents, if you look at statistics though, the percentage is going down in most cases.

Going through all this over the centuries, it is a miracle of what level of goodness our societies still have, whatever level it is at. Everything needs an overhaul. Social upbringing of the kids. How we teach and parent them. It should start from there. Be kind. Accepting. Instead of breaking rules set examples. The list can go on. But yes we need a total change. What is wrong with you? You mean to say that we do not have big achievements in sports, education or music? What parameters do you consider for signifying achievement? India has respectable achievement in sports such as Cricket, Hockey, Badminton, Billiards, Chess, Kabaddi,etc. We have achieved a lot in Music too. Your statement undermines the variety of Indian classical, folk, Sufi and even modern day music. Do I need to speak about education too? Even though we were literally fucked up by imperialist powers/invaders for hundreds of years, we have managed to achieve a lot in the last 70 years and we are going to do so in the coming years. Our grandparents and parents main focus was Roti, Kapda and Makan. Two entire generations have spent their lives in achieving basic human and physiological needs. Once these needs are fulfilled with stable means of sustenance, creativity and ingenuity will definately flourish.",2019-11-09 13:49:04

Enormous quantities of ration that isn't even the fraction of what is needed, all of that because they are born in the wrong place, to the wrong families, in the wrong castes etc.,

It just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done, the resources that could be utilized properly, i am extremely disheartened watching all this guys, very very disappointed!

Of such Inefficiency in exploitation!! I mean what the hell are we thinking?? Wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement! Like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something, or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it, maximizing enjoyment factor! All that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people, instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death, we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fist-full of food, but then kill them anyway! Instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently ""elevate"" these people, you know what we can do? GIANT MACHINES!! Machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix, we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass. We hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts!! Think about it, we can use this butt currency to improve our economy, place bets in the death matches etc!! Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months, imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that!! We..

>lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy\* by locking up the poor!  
>  
>\*only poor illiterates count. >Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months

Wrong fact.

Just get one thing straight, it doesn't matter however targeted programmes you run, there is only one way to remove poverty, that is is rapid economic growth. Rising tide lifts all boats. You may not want it but the country needs 10 more Mukesh Ambani’s so that they can employ millions and thus there is some hope for some people. Just see Chinese example, they didn't care about people opinions, they picked them from villages, provided them jobs, housing, medical and thus created chain of people coming out of abject poverty.

Though I am well aware this can't be implemented in India. [deleted] Hi,

So I feel the same way. You can't really change generations of class divide, however change yourself.

Treat everyone with respect. I say thank you and sorry to watchmen, chefs and Walters and try not to disturb them too much. Just be kind and understanding to all. Try not to dress too fancy all the time. Remember the zeros on the left side of your net worth matter alot, but after a while the zeros on the right and side matter less. 

Try to live a humble life. Never waste food or try to do so if possible. Try to use public transport and just be nice person who doesn't show off his or her money or parents money. Just don't give money in charity, but time also by volunteering for a cause you think you are good at. You don't know how many lives you cand drastically improve indirectly. I get confused with the term ""poor people"" offlate. At least, majority of those who qualify under the ""poor people"" category in cities don't really fall under this group as they earn really well, but in ""unaccountable ways"" aka without any taxation. How they spend their money is a different matter though. Most of these poor people earn a hand full in cities or don't earn because they are lazy (and not because of lack of opportunities). 

I feel every time I get exploited by these ""poor people"" rather than I exploiting them - it starts with almost everyone who fall into this BPL category and they will try to extract as much as possible from you or cheat you or want to get away with half baked work. Take your maid, auto driver, road sweeper, vegetable seller, construction worker, etc etc etc.. Just this evening, I am fooled with poor quality apples in spite of paying the amount he asked for it. 

PS: i am specifically referring to these fake poor people in cities and not the real poor, mostly outside big cities & towns, who struggle to meet ends inspite of hard work.",2019-11-29 15:03:07

Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above). 

- Meanwhile the match starts on Aug3 and we all go India...India with ads of Dream 11 and Godaddy after every over, khelo dimag se my friends",tchme_sensei," Basically 'Indian Army' is Dhoni's 'Being Human'? Bhai you deserve salute.

I wanted to say same things but you worded it perfectly.

Khelo dimaag se But movie mein to Dhoni ji bahot ache the? [deleted] What Malya couldn't do Dhoni did ""Soldier Bola, Argument Khatam"" seems to work everytime Yup  great PR by Dhoni Nd his team , all that's left now is to sign a Hotstar special deal .. talking about his innocence in this shit show.. I have a question regarding his stint with the army. He is in the territorial army and not the regular army (obviously). From what I understand, the territorial army is basically a standby force to be used in case it is needed, so they are given some basic combat training. So, my question is what exactly does 'serving' in the army mean in this case. Surely there is no emergency right now. So what exactly is he going to do? What has Byjus becoming the jersey sponsor got to do with the rest of the points? My humble advice to Dhoni is to please send that text messge to BJP and become a member. Jersey sponsorship deal was transferred by oppo to byju lekin humare jawan siachen mein lad rahe hai ! Bc BYJUS is that big Sorry for the dumb question, but what's the link between Amrapali and Dhoni? This man career graph is great.

TTE -> star cricketer -> Match Fixer -> Money Launderer. Next is some stalwart politician. Playing devil's advocate, when the entire Amrapali fiasco happened, no one - customers, brand advocates, etc. - knew that the deals would go south. Hindsight might be 20/20 but Amrapali looked like a huge, reputed developer at the time (which is why so many people invested in them). 

It's not uncommon for companies to offer brand ambassadors and celebrities stakes in their company instead of money. JustDial famously did it with Amitabh Bacchan. Soldier...Soldier... Btw there was no tender process as oppo is transferring their sponsorship to Byju’s, which is permitted as per their contract. This way BCCI makes more money in the form of re-assignment fee. The army thing is pretty obvious. It's how a child goes to his room and sits quietly after breaking something in the house. When the child is quiet you immediately know something is up. So when a wicketkeeper starts having dreams of joining the army it's quite obvious that something is up. Is Byju's really that profitable? I personally don't know a single person who has their app installed. How are they able to sponsor the Indian Cricket team and have stars like Shah Rukh act in their cringey adverts? True that bro...I think a lot of people are thinking on these lines now...heck I thought that dhoni is doing this to avoid answering the retirement question (how can you question Dhoni because questioning him will mean questioning the army!!)  however this Amrapali angle is a new one...meanwhile be ready for a lot of hate that is gonna come your way...there are enough dhoni worshippers out there... All this and I have only one question to ask. 'When is he joining BJP?' I don't get how Byju's fits into all this. Op do post it on r/cricket Excellent post and just portrays what a shady character this guy is. The fact that he still gets unconditional support from millions of clueless people just makes my blood boil. I agree with your post,since you mentioned other cricketers of the past I wanted to add that  [Sachin did ask for tax exemption long back for his ferrari](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/20030825-sachin-tendulkar-receives-tax-exemption-for-importing-his-ferrari-791920-2003-08-25) though not a fraud , it is not a fair play. Even I was thinking the same thing. This army stint just looks like a sham to divert attention from the Amrapali scam. He has been in the territorial army for years but I never heard anything about it. Honestly, dhoni is putting the lives of the solidiers around him in danger. As a celebrity, he is probably a high-valued target by terrorists and whatnot and him joining the gives them the oppurtunity to go after him. Do you think BCCI has something to do with this? I’ve been reading up a lot about them. They’re trying to create a monopoly in cricket; which is absolutely horrendous and could the whole game upside down. I would love to see BCCI being dissolved for a better non corrupt cricket authority in India: I shared this with a friend. He shared this link back from 2013.

[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/Raina-Jadeja-Ojha-managed-by-firm-owned-by-Dhoni/articleshow/20417389.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/Raina-Jadeja-Ojha-managed-by-firm-owned-by-Dhoni/articleshow/20417389.cms) Bharat mata ki jai. I also heard hes joining politics soon after his retirement. I guess he will fit right in. And guess what which party he willbe joining? Nicely written !
And you’ve raised some valid points.

But it will be difficult to make people understand who think “Dhoni? Nahi wo to kabhi aisa kar hi nahi sakta !!! Ye sab coincidence hai” I will never why rich folks turn to fraud ways to earn more. Why can't they do good? Naam to mera bhi aaya tha... Hot star special Same stunt by this guy. Supreme Court were about to release 5 names form CSK. This dhoni guys retires in middle of series in 2014 and comes back to India to Seattle the issue. Anyone else sick of the dream11 ads everywhere? Did supreme court pronounce Dhoni guilty? Why are we already declaring him a scoundrel? Punish him if he has committed any crime. But, propelled by our biases, we just love to jump to a conclusion, often without any access to all the relevant information.  We should remember that in several instances in the past, media trials have gone horribly wrong.

Dhoni has already filed a suit against the Amrapali group for payment of his dues. Is it possible that he was also duped like other home-buyers by Amrapali? The money involved is a pittance in comparison to  what Dhoni has already earned by the virtue of his cricketing talent and endorsements? The company route with his wife was maybe an arrangement for payments for his services to Amrapali? Again, it is not clear at this point that Dhoni has violated any law.

Right wing nationalism, or rather jingoism, and milking Army for personal or political gains is condemnable. However, it will be equally reprehensible to get to the other extreme and deplore anything and everything associated with Army. Until we humans achieve the Utopia of a peaceful, border-less and equitable world, Army will have a role to play.  Army roped in Dhoni, because it also benefited from the brand-name of Dhoni. As an individual, Dhoni is free to train with Army, and if Army is okay with that, why should we have any problem? Of course, just because of Dhoni's association with Army, his financial crimes, if any, should not go unpunished. But folks we should just wait for more facts to come to light, and see how this drama unfolds, before passing any summary judgement. Dhoni was the brand ambassador for Amrapali. And these contracts are handled by the agency. Apart from compensation for endorsements, what else was found? 

Plus, unless someone from Dhonis side is a director in Amrapali, they have no idea where the company gets money from and frankly nor do they ask, so siphoning would not be on them. Me and my friend were discussing this in class today and the coincidence is just....... too big of a coincidence. Oh and don't forget the stupid bimbo behind us saying we are ""anti-national"". Bitch stick to Vogue that's your only area of expertise. Don't split your hairs drawing Sherlock Holmes-y conclusions. This is a social platform. [deleted] This is interesting. love this post thats why i don't like any sport...except sleeping Great post! His next target is the Jharkhand CM seat with a BJP ticket. 

I stopped watching cricket a longg time ago. Back when those Manoj Prabhakars, Salim Malik, or Azhar, Sharjah scandal or that scoop by Tehelka came out. I felt at the time that this was the end of Cricket in India and people would stop following it (as it was for me). But no! The aam junta moved on, completely forgot about it, and went on with the hype of ""C'mon India dikha do!"" I laugh and feel bad for those die hard fans who actually watch with the games with full dedication without a figment of thought of something shady might be happening on the ground. For example, spot fixing recently. 

Not that I'm claiming all matches are fixed but my trust in the game (I still refuse to call it a sport) and players is as good as dead. If PM can use army for PR... why not Dhenier. Shakal se hi chor lagta hai madarchod Just cause you have not heard about controversies about other players does not mean it does not exist. I know for a fact that some of the companies that provide services to the BCCI have the wife's of some of the greats as directors and shareholders. I also know of an instance where one of the so called greats demanded money in lieu of some of the gifts that were given during a Party organized by one of the Big corporate companies during one of the world cup's.


This practice of having wife's and relatives of players & politicians holding shares or positions of benefit to companies that profit from Cricketing activities in India is much more common that most people think. It is not just Dhoni, most other senior players are guilty of this. The only names I have not seen mentioned is Ganguly and Dravid.

Though I am a fan of Dhoni, I am not defending him. Just pointing out that this is a very common practice, and unfortunately for Dhoni - things are out in public. Ahh it’s nothing to has to do about dhoni. And amrapali and other companies sometimes rather than paying fees just give celebs some share of their companies,which is what happened in this case.

Sports,Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Address,242,cnn6a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cnn6a9/prime_minister_narendra_modis_address/,160,"Today was PM Modi's LIVE public address.

In the very beginning of His speech, He highlighted the role of Pakistan in sponsoring terrorism in the valley, quoting around 42000 lives lost since 1948. He seems quite optimistic about the move of scrapping Article 370 and 35A, which he hopes will bring prosperity to the region. With the scrapping of the bill, he hopes citizens of J&K will benefit immensely. He raised the following points to the benefit of the people of J&K:

1. State employees of J&K will be awarded same benefits as other state employees like LTCs, HRA, Education allowance, Health insurance, etc., some of which are currently not available to them.
2. Public sector units and private sector units will be encouraged to employ more locals.
3. Government's PM Scholarship scheme will be implemented there asap.
4. Voting rights will be awarded to people who migrated from Pakistan to J&K during partition.
5. The election system will remain the same as earlier where they will elect their own representatives.
6. PM has urged the film industries in India to invest more in J&K.
7. He wishes to give sports a boost in the state by opening new sports academies, new stadiums, and impart science back sports knowledge.

What are your views on his  address today?

EDIT: Removed ""via FB"" as suggested by u/Jugad",swapniljadav," I hope all these developments (which sound very positive tbh) go hand-in-hand with ecological conservation. A lot of the territory there is in relatively pristine condition and since businesses will now have government backing to industrialize the area, they will almost certainly prioritize profits over everything else. 

Also, local separatist elements can use this for their rallying cries ('they will take our land and give it to those rich fucks'), so the government needs to be extra-careful there. We should heavily invest in Kashmir for sports.  
  
Something tells me we can get some future bowling greats from J&K. Smart Kashmiris might give this economic boost a try . But others stuck on religious and historical sentiments might pull them down..It will be interesting to see how this pans out , but I have a positive feeling about it..at the end of the day putting bread on the table is more important than following dogmatic customs Do people of J&K have access to TV? I want to say something other than speech. I was scared for kashmir few days back. Now, i am scared for our security forces. Pakistan will surely increase flow of money just to attack on our security forces. Its not about who is powerful and who is less powerful. No doubt, our forces are more powerful. Kuch bhi bolo lekin bande ka charisma on point hai. Did he mention when landlines and internet would be restored? I don't see how the film industry is going to help. > 2) Public sector units and private sector units will be encouraged to employ more locals.

We all know how this will play out, don't we? I called it first! https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cn3v2n/kashmir_megathread/ewauily/ 

Bhai will land in Kashmir next Eid.

Frankly I think the film industries point is a masterstroke.

I still think there will be protests etc once S144 is lifted. Muti/Abdullah/separatists are out of a job. So they will fight. Spoke of how high tech companies and BPO and other service providers should invest in Kashmir. At a time when internet connectivity and landlines have been cut off out there. What India misses now is a credible opposition which can hold the government responsible. Too much gyaan, but very few practical steps. 
Most likely all the benefits will go to Jammu in the hope that it will bring""trickle down"" benefit to kashmir. Unlikely that suddenly people in Kashmir valley will have a change of heart. 
It will be interesting to see how abdullah and mufti adjust to new reality. Government should focus on adventure sports there. > Today was PM Modi's LIVE public address via FB.

via Facebook? Is that the new address mechanism for the Indian PMO?

Or that it was live and Facebook also showed it (in addition to Youtube, News channels, etc etc)... in which case, you should not mention FB. >4) Voting rights will be awarded to people who migrated from Pakistan to J&K during partition.

Wait! Is he talking about NRC here? But how will the j&k residents know what he spoke about? Interestingly he made no mention of when the curfew will be taken off, no mention of revoking AFSPA. > What are your views on his address today?

My opinion is, his words are as meaningless as they can get! Whatever he says doesn't matter because he has never made good on his word. saam, daam, dand, bhed

that shit always(or eventually) works. Hilarious! This clown was addressing Kashmiris when they are cut off from all communications & cannot even lister to his bluster. Where is the announcement about marrying Fair Girls? 

>2. Public sector units and private sector units will be encouraged to employ more locals.

Wtf. I was thinking of migrating to Kashmir and buy land there. They will have to lift the curfew first.

And no, there won't be any miracle in Kashmir. Most of North India is Sub-Saharan African tier. The rest are barely a notch or two above. It's laughable to think a country that couldn't manage its majority provinces is somehow going to fix Kashmir. ഊമ്പും PROPAGANDA My thoughts: https://youtu.be/mchDikR-AAw [deleted]",2019-08-08 23:19:14

Hotstar still doesn't support surround sound.

Sports,A guide to anti-particulate masks,59,dpa2c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dpa2c2/a_guide_to_antiparticulate_masks/,18,"I live in Gurugram and it's that time of the year when the air's out to kill you. I see very few people using anti-particulate masks around me. Now, I don't know if that recklessness, ignorance, badassery or dumbassery, but I am going to build on a comment I made on an earlier post by /u/UndeniableDork and write a guide to buying an anti-particulate mask. Before I start, resistance or immunity to particulates or pollution isn't a thing. Don't be an unscientific dumbass. Protect yourself and educate people you care about.

Down below are the different categories of masks along with an example Amazon link for the class. I do not endorse any of these products. These are just masks I've used over the last four years living in NCR and I don't have any complaints regarding their effectiveness. All of these, besides the exceptions mentioned, have protected me from breathlessness, irritated throat and upper respiratory tract infection.

1. I see a lot of people using the green surgical masks that are used in hospitals. This **DOES NOT** protect you from particulates. It works for airborne germs and will protect you from that guy who'll sneeze in your face while commuting on metro, but it does little for pollution. Most of the anti-particulate masks listed below help with germs as well, but if you're in an elusive unpolluted town with job opportunities, you can just get these to protect yourself in flu season. Price: [Rs. 5 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Filtra-4-Ply-Loop-Surgical-Face/dp/B00IIIKZK6/)
2. The cheapest anti-particulate masks are disposable ones that are sold in sets of one, three, five or ten. I used 3M, Honeywell and Dettol and they are all fine. I'm partial towards 3M and Honeywell because they have been making these masks and selling them as industrial personal protective equipment for decades now. Also, 3M and Honeywell masks sell well among the residents of other polluted cities around the world. Price: [Rs. 13.5 per mask (80% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004-Particulate-Respirator-White/dp/B0146DETH6/), [Rs. 33.9 per mask (95% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004-Particulate-Respirator-White/dp/B0146DETH6/)
3. The next tier is disposable masks with exhalation valves. The exhalation valves prevent moisture buildup inside the mask keeping is less humid preventing it from getting warm and uncomfortable. 3M and Honeywell sell these masks as well. Depending on the time duration you'd like to wear them and the amount of physical exertion you're likely to undertake, you'll have to get a mask with a single exhalation valve or two exhalation valves. Price: [Rs. 37 per mask (80% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004GV-Particulate-Respirator-Mask/dp/B01LF2QMRQ/), [Rs. 127.8 per mask (95% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/Honeywell-Pollution-Foldable-Exhalation-Valve/dp/B01I9PVOPW/)
4. Then, there are high performance masks like the ones sold at Decathlon. You'll need these if you're planning to jog or cycle in a gas chamber. They also have dual ~~purification~~ exhalation valves ~~which are the main filtration component in the mask~~. The mask itself is reusable, but the purification filter must be replaced when you feel the air flow is getting limited. They admit more air flow than the ones above and they'll let you get more oxygen into your lungs while also blocking out particulates. *I haven't tried these masks and I cannot vouch for their effectiveness.* Price: [Rs. 499 per mask (Mask + Filter)](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8398131_sport-mask-light-blue.html#/254-), [Rs. 149 per filter (Replacement Filter)](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8397813_sport-mask-light-filter.html)
5. The most expensive ones are pretty looking masks like Vogmask and Cambridge mask that are made of cloth on the outside with a particulate filter inside. They also come with one or two exhalation valves. Some of these can be hand-washed an reused, but not with a detergent. Please remember that detergent fumes are carcinogenic. There are also masks with replaceable filters like the Decathlon one above. Some of these masks come with additional features such as activated carbon filters. These masks generally claim 95-99% efficiency. Price: [Rs. 299 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/PureMe-Reusable-Pollution-Activated-Filters/dp/B07KXMHNL7/), [Rs. 449 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Tdas-Anti-pollutiion-dustproof-Washable-Reusable/dp/B07YCWT6JY/), [Rs. 499 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07NC8DW9Z/), [Rs. 2000 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Dettol-Anti-Pollution-Cambridge-Newton/dp/B07JP8RBQ2/), [Rs. 2000 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Vogmask-Noir-CV-N99-Large/dp/B01J6KOW62/)
6. Nasofilters are an indigenous (AFAIK) product that is a filter that sits at your nostrils rather than functioning as a mask. So far, I've heard mixed reviews about them. The issue is see with them is that they don't filter air that will enter your respiratory system through your mouth. [Rs. 33 per pair of Nasofilters](https://www.amazon.in/NANOCLEAN-GLOBAL-Nasofilters-Pack-Boxes/dp/B078X6YFC6/)

A mask is only as effective as its fit around your nose and mouth. Honeywell masks, in their product guides, have a good way to test the effectiveness of what your wearing. If your mask is sitting right, it will puff up a bit every time you exhale and collapse a bit every time you inhale.

EDIT: Some corrections regarding high-performance sports masks. If you're looking for a mask for a child or an infant, look for smaller sized masks since adult-sized masks do not fit their faces and can end up causing suffocation for them.

Get an air purifier for your bedroom. Sleep quality improves when the air around you isn't full of shit. If you're unwilling to spend money on an air purifier, you can buy a PM2.5 filter screen for your air-conditioner ([Rs. 350 for a pack of 2](https://www.amazon.in/3M-Non-Woven-Electrostatic-Purifying-Filter/dp/B06XY536LF/)).

TL;DR: Wear an anti-particulate mask, there's a mask for everyone whether you're a broke-ass student or someone who makes 1.6LPM.",darthcarlo," Planning a trip with my toddler to Delhi in Nov 2nd week, she will be there for a week..worried for what should we do to protect her from pollution and particulate matter!

Dhoni? Not a chance. He will be busy for wc prep or atleast the ipl prep, even then, he would never join politics, but would prefer to serve in some way or the other with yhe army. Dude is obsessed.  Dhoni's not giving up his seat (in the current ODI setting despite poor performances) - he'd make a great MP! Pay a few lakhs more and ""sources"" will also say Obama is contesting on a TMC ticket I don't think so. Not a fan boy of anyone but this news doesn't match their nature. Dhoni is always known to stay away from media and TV so don't think he will get into dirty politics. Gambhir also is too strict over his principles. Gautam Gambhir was a certified hate spewing bhakt. Since his career died, he turned to BJp like a spineless chutiya. This was expected.

But what is wrong with Dhoni? He is actually someone who grew up in humble environment and worked his way up. Why would he go with BJP at all?

Sports,[General] What is your opinion about the IITs? Do you think they're worth it? What should be done to fix the obviously flawed institutions and their admission process?,4,eai2nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eai2nk/general_what_is_your_opinion_about_the_iits_do/,9,"Some of you may have come across one of my previous posts in this subreddit which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5sqaz/im_jee_aspirant_is_there_any_chance_i_can_crack/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) if you're looking for the full story. Basic information is that I've been preparing for JEE Mains exam but some problems have hindered my preparation and plan.

While preparing I couldn't ignore how flawed these institutions are, there's barely any research done, barely any breakthroughs in science, lack of innovation and a lot of it can be attributed to how these institutions take in students, the admission process is biased towards upper middle class and the rich, those who can afford the ridiculously expensive coaching institutions, the coaching culture is a demon in its own way and deserves a thread on its own but I'll keep it as straight and simple as I can. The admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to a specific type of question, it doesn't require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it.

I could go on and on about how the system is flawed, how they should introduce western ways to take in students which both supports extra-curricular activities, overall creativity, communication and sports.

In conclusion, I don't think they're worth 3-4 years of life the students have to sacrifice in order to get these institutions, the pressure and lack of social interaction.",iamnobody331," Fuck IIT. We don't need any more quora users around us. /s

But on serious note, IITs are one of the few options of becoming 1.6lpm earner in 4 years and can help a lower middle class person jump to upper middle class.

If you feel you aren't cut-out for IIT thats okay. There isn't a need to discredit that institution with made up stories. Cracking JEE and getting admission into an IIT has become more oriented around getting that celebrity status (you'll already know if an IIT is living in a radius of 50 KM or... three in-laws relations). 
I have seen Indian parents worshipping IITian like literally putting them on a pedestal, a prodigy, an example to your spoiled brat. It's more because of the hype of IITs. 
I remember vividly, when I was in 10th and one of my friends asked me - ""*Will you go for IIT?*"" , at that time I have no idea about even it's existence, it was like some new fad everyone's talking about.
I won't say JEE is biased though. But the competition has given to a varieties of problems. Depression, anxiety, anti-social living has become the pre-requisites for an IITian. We have to tackle this somehow before it's too late to be dealt with. Look, I get all the lack of research and creativity and all that stuff... But the fact of the matter is that an IITian tag is something that almost guarantees a better professional and social life.

An institute is much more than its admission process. The access to resources, alumni network, placecom networks, seniors etc is something that will give you a huge advantage all your life. They are worth I. What I have seen so far. But that’s because their curriculum is designed that way. Nothing extraordinary when compared to US education. System but stands out in our Indian educational process. But what I strongly dislike in them the most is their attitude at  workplaces. They behave like beyond genius, and form their own group and cult and won’t let anyone else mingle. They are snobbish and highly irritating group. That’s, by far, my experience so far. I could be wrong and their could be exceptions. Yes, if you wanna join 1.6lpm club asap > The admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to a specific type of question, it doesn't require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it.

Actually this is not true. The reason the exam is difficult is actually because you have to think in an innovative way about the problem.

> I could go on and on about how the system is flawed, how they should introduce western ways to take in students which both supports extra-curricular activities, overall creativity, communication and sports

IITs have the best infrastructure in India, so I doubt the situation is as bad as you're saying it is. 

> In conclusion, I don't think they're worth 3-4 years of life the students have to sacrifice in order to get these institutions

Maybe not 3-4 years, but they are definitely worth sacrificing 2 years, which most people do. As someone studying in a ""Tier 2"" college now, IITs are miles ahead of us. IMO you should definitely try your hardest to crack the exam. >The admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized  formula to a specific type of question, it doesn't require you to  approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to  think about it.

I LOLed so hard at this. These papers are no joke and do require a lot of practice and deep thinking to be able to crack it. 4 years ago One of my teachers in FIITJEE said that if your hardwork must compensate for the deficiency in IQ. People some require 2 hours, some may require 5 hours and some may require 10.

The most amusing part of this paper is that you seem to be confident that I am well prepared and when you see the paper, it's on an entirely new fucking pattern with new types of question. At that point, you must dynamically adjust yourself and 2 years of prepartion else you are screwed.

>I don't think they're worth 3-4 years of life the students have to  sacrifice in order to get these institutions, the pressure and lack of  social interaction

You haven't seen anything. I am in my final year from a non-IIT govt college. Even though I simply cannot be anymore thankful to the govt for the facilities provided for basically peanuts, screwing up JEE is the biggest regret of mine till date.

I went to IIT Fests, did my internship from IIT and believe me, they are worth your perseverance and dedication you put in for 2-3 years.

I am a placed person. I got a package of 7.15 lpa and I cannot be any happier about it but my people who never put as much effort as me got double the package of mine just because they are from IIT (particularly IIT D).

It's a tag worth fighting for. At least you won't regret that you didn't give it a shot. The amount of shit thrown at IITs is unreal.

They are the best institutions in the country for a reason. For all the complaints about shitty admission exam (it's actually not shitty, it relies less on memory power than any other entrance exam in India), I can guarantee you that an average IITian is better than an average student from other institutions.

Yes, the iitian ego is real but that doesn't taint the fact that the institutions are undoubtedly the best in India right now. 

Regarding the complaints about research, you should keep in mind that the Mtechs or PhDs in IITs are not the ones who did undergrad in IITs (who passed that admission test). Rather, they are undergrads in other non-IIT colleges. To gauge how IITian research is, you have to go through the research progress of foreign universities (whatever Tier you pick, IITians are ubiquitous. You can even find profs there who did their undergrad in IITs). So, your complaint about research should really be targeted at how bad the undergrad studies in non-IITs are.


Having said that, IITs have their own faults. They are still not ideal. Nevertheless, they are the best India had, has and will have.",2019-12-14 18:10:55
Sports,I wish I was well informed in subjects or had opinions like you guys.,245,crzhie,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/crzhie/i_wish_i_was_well_informed_in_subjects_or_had/,73,"Every post I see, there's someone who's passionate about the topics ranging from politics to sports to finance and I have opinions on none of them that can be backed with facts. It's like some of you are like walking encyclopedias. 

Just a random appreciation post.",Cynaren," Lol, there's no such thing like too well informed. The people whom you're talking about are either experts in the subject or are avid readers. All you have to do to make your wish come true is to know about your own line of work, and read about the topics you're interested in. For example, I'm a medical professional and I have responded to a couple of related posts, and since I like the posts related to politics too, I read up on the topic before responding. It's about how badly you want to know the topic, not about how much you already know Firstly don't club everyone into one ultra smart person. A highly upvoted post/comment will be likely from an expert and naturally it will be rare. Secondly, if you are in awe of this level of expertise in general, then it is likely you haven't got expertise of this level in any area. But you will, as you grow up. And also as you act on this awe from now itself, if you do that. Thirdly, when you start doing research or reading you will realise how much you are capable of and it's almost guaranteed you underestimate that as of now. Vastly. I literally spout bs until someone calls me out on it and then I have to read about it to not make a fool of myself any further Read more on topics you like to master. It takes years of passionately reading different voices on topic to form an informed opinion. Even a less read person can sound well informed to someone who doesn't read at all.

The point is : read. Read about stuff you like. Make time for it. Instead of knowing every little news on Internet, focus on what you want to read. 

We have an information mountain at our hands, but we have to pick what kind of info we want. Don't get overwhelmed by the size of the mountain, pick the stones that you need. 

That's all you need. _I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing._

~Plato Read both sides of the story from many sources and then form your own opinions. Everyone has an agenda. You think people here or anywhere online actually know what they're talking about? Oh, you innocent babe! If you start reading a good Newspaper regularly then it will help you build opinions. You are good man. These days it is so easy to have an opinion. You are way above the rest of the crowd. Stay there. No sweetie, people are really lonely here Nobody here knows anything. Everyone is just faffing, or at least 90% of them. None of us are walking encyclopaedias. Each on of us just knows more than usual about 1-2 subjects. But everyone specialises in different subjects, so it feels like everyone knows everything. Lol half of the upvotes on political posts are from bots and astroturfing is the way of life for pro govt voices here. TBH, many posters do appear *opinionated* but often speak without coming across as *well-informed* - and resort to *ad hominem* attacks and downvoting if asked for validation of their claims.  So don't be shy and join the crowd... Beg to differ on the politics bit. Indians and political information is not always well informed and involves a lot of cherry picked information. Both left and right thinkers are guilty of this. You just gotta read more. Bonus if you have personal experience or have been involved with the subject of the discussion. Who says people here are well informed lmao 😂. Bruh we are all just shitposting.

Second. Its not rocket science like they want to think it is. If you really want facts, then you'll have to do your own first hand research. But do remember that facts are only bits and pieces that form a **narrative** and a narrative typically stands on both fact based and rumor/propaganda based opinions.

The opinions you typically hear from different people reflect their support for a narrative, its immaterial for them whether its based on facts or not. In general, a narrative is supported by both facts and a bit of propaganda by media. We live in an age of information warfare, so propaganda is bound to exist on both sides. If one side ceases to create propaganda, the other side spreading it wins in the narrative battle. And losing this battle could mean losing both elections and public support.

Regarding which narrative to support for, read all the facts and opinions in support and against that narrative, and then ask your heart. Your own prejudices will also contribute in forming that narrative. Some people have a pro-establishment bias while others have an anti-establishment one, so they'll accept or reject narratives based on that bias. You can also be a centrist and support bits and pieces of both narratives, and your support for a narrative can even change as new information comes up. Hey that’s OK. You might be informed or be opinionated or passionate about other things. No one gets to decide if someone who has opinions on politics is smarter than someone who has opinion on smartphones or video games. 

Go easy on life. It’s not a race to be smart. Look at the strength of the sub. 242k members. Obviously there will experts from different fields. Not too late mate, you can learn too. Read about logical reasoning and critical thinking, then apply it to world affairs.

Also nobody is fully informed about anything. We learn something new every day. Well let me leave you with a tidbit. There is a term in psychology called the Dunning Kruger effect. It states that people mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. 

So while people may have an opinion on everything , unless they are an expert or at the very least have all the facts on a topic to make a proper assessment most people are usually speculating. Depends on what u are interested in As someone here already commented, it's about how badly you want to learn the subject. I am crazy about software engineering - building beautiful, maintainable, secure software. Almost everyday, I read on topics design patterns, distributed systems, etc. There's a LOT to learn as I am just starting out, but it feels good when you understand what the ""pros"" in the team are talking about. 

In the end, it's all about hard work. India has 1.3 billion people. So definitely somebody knows something. You also something about something. ! Don't fall for the peer pressure. Just chill.  The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.”   
― **Socrates** You are not alone. Here, if [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92Hf_Dm-HiY) makes you feel better :) An important thing to remember, I think, is that not everybody who offers opinions on a subject is an expert, or even moderately knowledgeable. Most people comment on things with only a rudimentary understanding of what’s going on- hence we have so much misinformation floating around. It’s easy to feel as though you don’t know anything compared to the scholars on the internet who seem to have swallowed the encyclopedia brittanica whole, but remember that’s usually not the case. 

Also, like someone else said, knowing things is easy, as long as you make an active effort. Join the world news sub. Read a newspaper. Educate yourself through the internet. The good thing about this generation is that information is only a click away. But keep in mind, most accounts of events, whether current or historical, come heavily biased, so steer clear of forming any concrete views based on one piece of information.

Also also, find what interests you, and the information will come to you naturally! When we first started dating, I was supremely in awe of my ex because he knew so much about engineering and technology and politics. I got caught up trying to overload myself on those topics before realizing that I knew just as much as he did, except about history and literature and architecture. While it’s great to have a basic understanding of everything, don’t feel obligated to know everything about the topics you don’t enjoy. Same feeling just read books and newspaper, 

honestly reading newspaper is also quite fine 

you'll soon see yourself having an opinion as well I have legitimately never seen someone here who was accurately informed about something here,  been lurking a long time.  It's just rabid and opinionated people.  People here make a lot of fun of Quora,  but it is far far better than Reddit in terms of getting information / explanation.  Specifically about politics. Follow subreddit like r/truereddit I've been using Reddit for only an year and it seems i know more about the US political scene than the Indian one... lol. I spend hours and hours of my day, everyday to learn about a variety of stuffs other than the ones I'm already well versed at.

It just takes the will dude. You have to love doing it. I'm no special than you. 

That and ignore the r/iamverysmart and r/thathappened jackasses. It's people like them is why Reddit has become a cesspool of misinformation which drives away  real discussion.

A few years back if you had a well informed but controversial opinion, people discussed and debated you before coming to a conclusion. Now they just downvote you and link to those subs and kill and discussion.

Case in point: yesterday a guy said on this sub that he doesn't know Thanos. He's a very active Redditor which means he spends a fuck ton of time on the internet. If he didn't hear about the biggest movie villain of this decade it just feels weird because the net is full of memes and jokes and references.


I just pointed that out and got downvoted to Oblivion. Fuckers never even stopped and thought that you would have to be living under a mountain to not hear about the movie event of the century. You should visit the LNRDTs. That's where you'll see the real randia. I think we've got more opinions than information actually [deleted] All of us are passionate about something. I am sure you are too.",2019-08-18 18:12:00

Why is it then that we don't see anyone taking the effort to get into politics? Is it such a bad field? Surely, it can't be worse than being a mechanical engineer in TCS. Are the returns so small when compared to efforts? Are the initial ""investments"" so high that a common man can't even imagine?

There are politicians who haven't won a single election for decades but still contest, still fight for their people and they never lose hope.
It is damn difficult to keep own family happy ,as a politician even a voter wants a fortune in exchange of just one vote.,I am not even talking about chamchas and karyakartas.

The reason criminals like Mukhtar Ansari, pedophiles like Kuldeep sengar, Gopal Kanda win elections not because of muscle power but they do work for their own people.

India is not a democracy like USA where out of the blue a businessman like donald Trump or an popular actor like Ronald Reagan  can directly become prime minister . You could be anything and everything in India if Amit Shah allows. Let me tell you a reality of this world.


The one who people follows is the one who is most popular. Not the one who is intelligent. The one who can say good things and had a strong body language.

Politics and picking up women is very similar. You have to practice enough to speak your lies convincingly and with strong body language.

Are there large barriers to entry into federal politics? What about local? I can only speak for the US but most of our politicians have very similar career paths (top schools, law degree, associate at elite firm) and need serious financial backing to win an election which means they tend to be well-connected. Is it the same in India? Having a PhD in any said background  makes the politician have a greater depth of knowledge in his field .
The  mininsters' and politicians' main objective is to approve  of decisions which are being suggested by a carder of ias officers. They are also responsible to voice the concern of the citizens of their constituency for their greater good.

Sports,Are there no centrists in India who are not completely polarised by political ideologies and are objective in assessing & supporting Govts based only on their administration?,11,e9nmtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e9nmtc/are_there_no_centrists_in_india_who_are_not/,5,"I am a centrist. An Indian who believes that Govts and political parties are not boyhood football, cricket and other sports teams that you have to be loyal to and support no matter what or oppose no matter what. 

I can praise a party for the right steps they took and criticise the same people for the wrong ones. 

Just like it happens in good corporate cultures. Based on merit & performance. 

No one or no party is bigger than the country and what it good for the future of it's people. Why can't we as citizens start getting more objective in our assessment? The best countries on Earth have the least amount of political polarisation as the people there only want progress. 

For eg. Not everything that a party XYZ has done is correct because you support them and not everything the same party did is wrong is because you loathe them. 

Currently I find it difficult to find like minded people who are objective in their outlook without having to identify themselves rigidly with being completely anti someone or completely pro someone. I feel we can never progress until we come out of this fanboyism. 

This is not an agenda I'm trying to propagate, but perhaps I can be enlightened by some insights on why this happens.",innuuniv_yaniv," I have little problem being objective if a party is anchored towards moderation and liberalism in governance.

BJP under Vajpayee was still rightwing hindutva but didn't go crazy with social engineering or illiberalism, and stuck to the secular constitutional principles prevalent till then. I didn't like some of their lapses such as the 2002 pogrom and attempts at saffronizing education then, but I also had no problem appreciating the nuclear tests, the NH network, Kalam's nomination as president, the Kargil victory, and even the post-parliament attack kashmir standoff.

Similarly, I appreciate congress of the 90s and 00s for their economic developments, Nehru's nation building, RTI and NREGA UBI under MMS. At the same time, I absolutely hated Indira and Sanjay's authoritarianism that resulted in enduring degeneration of Indian politics, corruption of people like Kalmadi, MMS saying he's helpless about corruption due to ""coalition dharma"", poor governance in my state of Karnataka under Rahul Gandhi's insipid leadership. 

It's possible to be objective about moderate politicians and parties.

But BJP under Modi and Shah turned out to be a whole different ballgame. Till end-2015 or so, I assumed Modi had matured on being made PM, come out of his Gujrat pogrom mindset, and himself become a ""centrist"". I even remember mentally appreciating the rafale ready-to-fly deal of 2015 thinking here's somebody more efficient than our babus. Then slowly the incessant shitshow started and has never stopped from 3 years - biased jingoistic media, demo craziness, incessant propaganda, IT cell mischief, fake news, murder of a judge, supreme court bench fixing, lynchings, complicated GST, electoral bonds, Rafale corruption, NRC social engineering, Kashmir fiasco.

This is not just another party. I see them as now as literally extremists of the taliban variety, who also happen to be dishonest, incapable, corrupt and authoritarian. A political mafia is what they are. It's not mentally possible for me to appreciate the ""good"" deeds of such extremists. It's the equivalent of hearing ""yes, asaram and his son molested young girls but so what? at least he built schools too"". Some roads built or some gas cylinders handed out doesn't redeem extremists. Let them turn themselves away from their current path and return governance back towards liberal constitutionalism and institutional democracy, and then we can think of returning to centrism. I'm pretty sure that there are centrists among us. It's just that the mindset of ""If you're not with us, you're against us"" is strongly reinforced in our current political climate. If a person supports a certain initiative, they are lumped into the party that leads it. Being lumped comes with the assumption that the person shares the same ideology of said political party which, for the most part, is true. There are exceptions, of course (like being a centrist).     

Objectively looking at decisions is pretty straightforward. If only making decisions in real time were that simple. I don't think I even have a name for my views.The only thing I care about,is that whether or not,what the govt is doing will affect the people OF THE COUNTRY in a positive way or a negative way.
I am not so humane that I will weep for all the bad happening in another country,but seeing empty shops and limping dogs in dirty streets IN MY COUNTRY pains me.

Still,if the country was already a developed nation,I think I would have very humanitarian views on things.At the moment though,I only lean towards the country's development as we have one hell of a f*cked country.
All the foundations for being a great country is right there(a religion of acceptance,culture,great food,workforce,consititution etc) but we manamged to twist and turn pretty much everything if it comes to real life.

Congratulations Jeremy. This lifted my spirit up !
No pun intended. India's future looks very bright in sports :) Amazing Well done. Kudos Jeremy.

Keep up the good work. Just casually looking for fellow Mizos on the sub. Lol.

JK. Huge kudos to Jeremy. While the nation is still arguing about Dhoni's performance, we've had this news and Dutee Chand as well. There is definitely enough talent in India to establish ourselves as a strong athletics power if the backing and support is there. anyone remember this post by r/puppuli?

Sports,My assessment on Indian Olympics contingent,16,d7lsqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d7lsqd/my_assessment_on_indian_olympics_contingent/,13,"I was very excited about India's chances at Rio Olympics but sadly we were very unlucky there. I was very heartbroken after last Olympics. Been following Indian Olympics sports very closely for last 4 years and I feel this time we can genuinely finish with 10 medals (if we get some luck in our favour). Here are my predictions :-

1) Shooting is very unpredictable sport but this time we have many fearless youngsters who are performing exceptionally well. We should win more than 3 medals at least if all goes well. Our best chances are in events like 10m Air Pistol (both men & women), 10m Air Rifle (both men & women) and Mixed Air Pistol & Mixed Air Rifle team event. You can check performance of our shooting team here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_ISSF_World_Cup

2) Mirabai Chanu is most certain to win a medal for us at Tokyo. At recently concluded World Championship she finished at fourth place with Chinese occupying top 2 spots. But in weightlifting, a country can only send one athlete in Olympics so that means Mirabai will be 3rd at worst. She is currently 13 kg ahead from her nearest competitor https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Weightlifting_Championships_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_49_kg

3) I think everyone here is aware about Sindhu's badminton exploits. So I won't explain too much. We can also win a surprise medal in men's singles.

4) In Wrestling, Vinesh Phogat & Bajrang Punia is most certain to win a medal for us. We can also win one or two medals from wrestling if we get a favourable draw. Check our wrestling performance from ongoing World Championship https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships

5) Amit Panghal is a favourite to win a medal in boxing. He is current Asian Games & Asian Championship gold medalist. He has recently won a silver in World Championship. There were 3 other Indian boxer who were in QF at world championship. I'm slightly unsure about India's chances in women's boxing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_AIBA_World_Boxing_Championships

Outside of these 5 sports, we have half-chances to win a medal in few other sports like Archery, Hockey, Golf and Tennis. I'm not expecting any medals from athletics. Only Niraj Chopra can finish inside top 5 in athletics event.

This is my own assessment. Please tell me if I'm missing some other medal contenders.",gauravxm," Sports budget must be made 10x and schools/colleges must encourage sports.

New schools must not be allowed to open if they dont have proper sports and recreational facilities

Then lets see how India does not get dozens of golds! I mostly agree with your assessment. A lot can happen over the course of a year but I’m conservatively pegging the tally at 10 myself(6 in shooting, 2 wrestling, 1 badminton, 1 weightlifting). I don’t see any medals in athletics. Boxing despite Amir’s silver will depend hugely on the draw. Archery is a long shot too. I don't know where you got the info that one country can only send one athlete for weightlifting. In the past, I have seen more than one Man i wish Bajrang Punia good luck, this world championship he was robbed fuck the kazak ref

Hush puppies for ankles and formals. Decathlon ones for both.

Jockey sucks in this department for me. Won't recommend. How often do you wash them? Buy from Decathalon. It's cheap, good and lasting. Yeah it is a weird question... But than you are on reddit so you shouldn't have to worry about that.. Puma. Bit expensive but comfy. I use Converse socks, found them very durable, you get them for around 300-400 for a pack of 3. Been using Jockeys for almost everything. Be it gym, college or parties. They are quite comfortable. Timberland for thicker cushioned heel socks. My current set of socks are going fine even after 5 years of regular use and washing cycles. Nike and Hanes sports socks are not bad either. I have been using TEGO unisex coolmax socks for the last 6 months. These are the most comfortable socks I have ever used in my entire life. As far as I can tell, these are very very durable too. Under Armour’s Charged Cotton ones. Got 6 pairs in December 2016, wash them in 90c after one wear (along with bed sheets/underwear/towels), and they’re still perfect. Colour has gone off a bit, though. 

They’re light, stretch 4 ways, and absorb sweat perfectly. For formals buy silk. Would last a lifetime

For exercise, but thick socks with padding. I use Nike and they last a long time Hush Puppies and Decathlon are the best in my experience On a related note, anyone using shoe cushion/pads? Nike Do you cut your toenails?
I didn't or left the nails sharp and mine always tore near the toenails and the whole sock pair needed to go Hanes. Comfy, keeps it's shape after repeated use and multiple washings. Socks made of Bamboo fibre. Needs washing less often, as they don't give out odour as cotton ones do. I buy 5 identical pairs at a time. If 2 randomly fails, I throw away 2, not 4 socks. If your failure mode is even wear and tear, buy expensive socks. FootPrints socks from amazon, costs about 90-100 per pair when bought as a  set of 5 pairs.

The document itself has 3 parts:

1. School Education

2. College/University Education

3. Additional Key Focus Areas

In the interest of keeping the discussions focussed and understandable, I have split it into 3 posts.
This is part 1.

Part 2 is now up: https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bx1lr7/key_points_from_the_new_education_policy_2019/

---
##Summary

This policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.

The first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student's mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

The new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be ""age fluid"". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends that during the foundation stage there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new ""stimuli"" to force children's brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don't so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, and will be better enforced. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of ""anganwadis"" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. The NEP requires the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies and daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.

The next ""Preparatory stage"" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education *must* take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good write-up on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the ""textbook education"". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called ""co-curricular activities"" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education. It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of ""national training system"".

The third stage is the ""Middle Stage"". By this time, the student's mind would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -> physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.

The fourth, and final stage is the ""High Stage"". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in ""the bigger picture"" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final courses they choose.

Some important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history and regional literature.

The next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form ""complexes"". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex as a whole offers all of the above stages. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and ""backwardness"" of the population).

Schools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.

In order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.

To reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren't attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with ""upper caste students"", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be ""equalised"", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.

The next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to ""re-educate"" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy.
Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.

The next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests.  They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.

This policy also paves the way for better recognition of ""top talent"" students. For e.g. if a student is really good in Math, then they will be attending special summer schools to improve their performance. As already mentioned, top students are also required to tutor the students who are have a hard time coping. There is also a new emphasis on Olympiads. This should improve India's ranks in international competitions.

The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.

As for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can't be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.

Schools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers’/principals’ education/training programmes and refresher courses. Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).

Also, in addition to all this, alternative forms of schools like gurukulas, patashalas, and madrassas will be encouraged, as long as they follow a modernised syllabus and are fully transparent.

The first changes will be implemented by 2020, with most major changes being in place by 2022. The first benefits will be seen by 2025, and by 2030, we should have fully transitioned, with all benefits in place.

##Comparison With the Current System:

The existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states and TN were the primary offenders. Now all students are required to learn languages as per the Three Language Formula. The other way the old system failed was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests only cared about how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.

The other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of ""extra curricular"" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should be an improvement.

Please discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.

##TL;DR:

1. Learning to learn

2. Mother tongue as primary language of learning

3. Focus on trilingual policy, with English no longer as primary language

4. Equality of all students

5. Arts, Sports, Music, literature, etc. are all now of primary importance, and each student has to specialise in one of these, in addition to courses of their choice

6. Digital Education

7. Freedom of choice in higher stage of education

8. Board exams removed in favour of more frequent ""census exams""

9. Testing now to focus on aptitude and understanding, with more frequent tests, a la CCE under CBSE

10. 10+2 eliminated in favour of 5+3+3+4, with full focus on primary (3-8 years) of education",gryphus-scarface," I envy the new generation. I'm feeling sooo jealous right now. This writeup is simply superb.

It the posts like this makes me visit R/india. Trust me - none of the media outlets I follow have even given me a hint of these changes. All I hear from them is Hindi Imposition. 

Thanks and Kudos to OP!! Hey OP! You're doing great work bro. Thanks for the tremendously helpful post. 

I'm curious if there are any reforms around higher education as well. Will look up the draft. Wish I could give you gold. I love your detailing both this post and the replies Awesome!! The policy is really disruptive. It completely overhauls the current Indian education system. It touches each and every aspect of child education be it technical, cultural, moral etc. If implemented properly, it would really go a long in ensuring holistic development of children.

One thing I specifically like about the draft is that they are treating educationn as a continuum, not in segments (like primary, secondary etc) like it is right now. Hey OP could you create a PDF of this and the credit so we can then distribute this too those who are not on Reddit. This is great work and I think it needs recognition. Aaah man...this is the revamp our Education System has needed for ages. I hope we are able to see the benefits soon if this system is implemented across the country. 

Am so jealous and at the same time happy for the future generations of India who won't have to mug up textbooks.

Hope we are able to find well qualified teachers who will be the backbone for such a system. The highlights from the document (page 1 to 198):

##Primary Education:

###Understanding:
- Primary education (between 3-6 years of age) is critical for student development. 85% of student development happens in this age, as concluded from studies conducted by NCERT (sample size = 30,000 kids) (referred to as ECCE : Early Childhood Care and Education)

- Students who fall behind early tend to remain so for the rest of their life. Thus ECCE is probably the most important education provided

- ECCE includes health and nutrition of mother and child, along with various emotional and cognitive stimuli, like talking, music, games, etc.

- Crucial self-help skills must be learnt, including most good habits

- Children under the age of 8 do not follow the linear education as prescribed in the current curriculum

- Supervised play based education is proposed.

- Proposal to make everything in education from ages 3-8 one pedagogical unit, called ""Foundational Stage""

- The [Anganwadis system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anganwadi) (under Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)) when well funded has been successful

- Anganwadis don't provide the required education that ECCE demands

- Private preschools largely act as literal pre-schools, simply adding more education

- Private preschools have high Pupil Teacher ratio (PTR) and the teachers generally lack the skills necessary fro quality ECCE education. Don't help in health aspects.

- Majority of Indian students lack ECCE, as verified through studies by Ambedkar University, Delhi.

- Thus art, music, literature, etc. all of which have been historically part of Indian ECCE must and will be added

- Recommendation : include ECCE in RTE

###Corrective actions:

- NCERT scope expansion to include ECCE

- New framework will include details on making cheap toys for quality stimulation of infants (0-3 years age). For 3-8 year old children will have flexible play, activity, discovery based learning, teaching numbers, alphabets, basic communication, etc. Engagement with music, art, literature from India's vast history, including emphasis on regional variety.

- Strengthen Anganwadi education system. At least one Anganwadi worker with full training in ECCE per Anganwadi.

- Co-locate Anganwadis with schools

- Build stand alone preschools in areas where Anganwadis and schools exist

- Since ECCE is equalising, districts with socio-economic disadvantages will get special attention

- No separation on age basis in ECCE. Students from age 3-8 only.

- All of this will shift to under the MHRD or be under MCWD

- New committees in each state including : Cognitive scientists, early childhood education experts, artists, and architects, to design spaces for ECCE education

- Physical infra will be safe and clean, along with access to all basic amenities

- State govt. responsible for making quality educators. Current educators will get 6 month training course

- Everyone need to understand importance of ECCE


##Foundational Literacy and Numeracy:

- Objective : By 2025, every student in Grade 5 and beyond has achieved foundational literacy and numeracy.

###Issue at hand:

- Numerous studies show that students who fall behind here are unable to catch up for years, show flat learning curves

- Large number of students who fall behind in school fall behind in the first weeks of grade 1

- Schooling in the early years also lays too little curricular emphasis on foundational literacy and numeracy and, in general, on the reading, writing, and speaking of languages and on mathematical ideas and thinking.

- Few teachers have the opportunity to be trained adequately for this

- Teacher deployment is an issue

- Nutrition is critical issue

- Impossible for teachers to fix situation. Needs full effort from teachers, parents, schools, policy makers, etc.

- Teachers will be pushed into ""backward areas"" ASAP

- Nutrition and health (including mental and physical) will be addressed

- Urgent national mission

- Expansion of midday meal programme: Both a nutritious breakfast (e.g. even just some milk and a banana) and a midday meal will be served to pre-primary and primary school students. 

###Corrective actions:

- Dedicated reading hours in math and literature for grades 1-3

- Dedicated language and mathematics week

- Regular language and math ""melas""

- Weekly math and language oriented assemblies

- Weekly activities in libraries, like story telling, theatre, group reading, etc.

- Explore connections between real and class math

- Workbooks on language and mathematics

- National Teacher’s Portal (DIKSHA) will have a special section of high quality resources on foundational literacy and numeracy. Sources from across the country

- National Tutors Programme (NTP) where the best performers in each school will be drawn in for up to five hours a week as tutors during the school for fellow (generally younger) students who need help.

- Remedial Instructional Aides Programme (RIAP) as a temporary 10-year project to draw instructors - especially women - from local communities to formally help students who have fallen behind and bring them back into the fold.

- Instructional Aides to be 12th graduates, or highest available from the region, and will be from local communities. ""Backward community"" IAs encouraged.

- Encouragement of large-scale community and volunteer involvement: ex-teachers, ex-service men, etc.

- Adaptive assessment scheme will be developed

- computer based adaptive assessment first in secondary education, then by 2023, for the rest

- Extra aides to teachers via smartphones, apps and other technology

- Grade 1 students get 3 month long ""school prep module"" to make them ready for school

- Increase parental participation as home environment is important for proper education

- Ensuring proper teacher deployment and teacher conditions, and a Pupil Teacher Ratio under 30 : 1 at every school

- Libraries across the country will increase and expand

- Social workers and counsellors to be hired to work in schools

##Reintegrating Dropouts and Ensuring Universal Access to Education:

- Objective: Achieve access and participation in free and compulsory quality school education for all children in the age group of 3-18 years by 2030.

- according to U-DISE data, the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in 2016-17 for Grades 1-5 was at 95.1%

- access to secondary schools and upper secondary schools remains a very serious issue.

- Socio-cultural and economic issues also play a significant role in dropout rates

- There also remain serious issues of **inadequate infrastructure and lack of safety.**

- students **do not find school interesting or useful.**

- Increasing the intake capacity of existing schools in areas where many students are out of school;

- Building new educational facilities in under-served or un-served locations;

- Consolidating existing stand-alone primary, upper primary, secondary, and higher secondary schools into composite schools

- Better transport facilities, like proper roads, and bicycles for older students, school buses, organised walking groups, paid walking escorts, etc.

- Free room and board facilities in the form of hostels will be built - matching the standard of Navodaya Vidyalayas, for schools with large number of students from far away areas

- Safety is core concern, especially for under-represented groups. Zero-tolerance policy towards breaches of child rights will be adopted to ensure physical and emotional safety of children.

- Transparent system to track attendance, and immediately enquire if students are absent

- Dropouts aged 15 and above, who have fallen too far behind or are nearly illiterate, will be given the alternative option to attend adult literacy programmes 

- To make it easier for both governments as well as non- governmental philanthropic organisations to build schools, to encourage local variations on account of culture, geography, and demographics, and to allow alternative models of education such as gurukulas, paathshaalas, madrasas, and home schooling, the RTE Act requirements for schools will be made substantially less restrictive.

- Extension of RTE to students in age group 14-18 (so students from ages 3-18 are covered in RTE) I'm heavily impressed by the draft if one doesn't talk of the language issue. Now let's hope that the implementation doesn't get fucked over.

Coming to the language policy, if the centre has so much problem with English, they should promote the 23 scheduled languages instead of only Hindi. The problems of giving English too much prominence will still stay, only Hindi replaces English. Rather, more focus should be given on bilingual education in English and the native language. In that way, no Indian community gets an unfair advantage/disadvantage because they happen to speak Hindi natively.  And if the government is so keen to promote Hindi, make it an elective in the 3rd language slot for people who don't speak Hindi natively. An overwhelming majority will end up picking Hindi anyway, because speaking Hindi has its advantages in India. Its imposition doesn't. Bilingual education will also ensure a smoother transition to higher education where the courses are usually taught in English only (for pragmatic reasons). ##Teachers

- Objective: Ensure that all students at all levels of school education are taught by passionate, motivated, highly qualified, professionally trained, and well equipped teachers.

**self note** page 113-117 detail the need and requirements of teachers, along with existing issues they face. Gives very important perspective.

- The harmful practice of excessive teacher transfers will be halted with immediate effect

- suitable NTA test scores in the corresponding subjects will also be taken into account for recruitment.

- a classroom demonstration or interview will become an integral part of teacher hiring

- teachers will often be hired to a school complex (conglomerate of nearby local schools) to ensure there are suffiient teachers for all subjects

- schools and/or school complexes will be permitted and, indeed, supported with suitable resources to hire local eminent persons or experts as “specialised instructors” in various subjects

- A comprehensive teacher requirement planning exercise will be conducted across India and in each State

- The primary goal of overhauling the service environments and cultures of schools will be to maximise the abilities of teachers to do their jobs effectively

- Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools

- The creation of the school complex as the smallest viable unit of governance will help create vibrant communities of teachers

- teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes

- teachers will not be allowed any longer to conduct government work that is not directly related to teaching (except for rare events that do not interfere with their class work) so as to avoid excess load

- the role expectations of principals and teachers will explicitly include developing a caring and inclusive culture at their schools, for more effective learning for all, and for the benefit of all in their communities.

- teachers will be given more autonomy in choosing finer aspects of curriculum and pedagogy

- Teachers must be given constant opportunities for self-improvement and to learn the latest innovations and advances in their profession.

- Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers.

- Leaders such as school principals and school complex leaders will be have similar modular leadership / management workshops and online development opportunities

- Career management of teachers is an important area of reform to restore the prestige of the teaching profession

- A robust merit-based promotion and salary structure will be developed. A system of multiple parameters for proper assessment of performance will be developed for the same. Vertical mobility of teachers based on merit will also be paramount.

- Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy

**self note** to see the detailed changes tp teacher educational qualifications, see pages 120-121

- Substandard standalone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible

###Effective teacher recruitment and deployment

- Merit-based scholarships to encourage outstanding students to enter the teaching profession

- The recruitment process for teachers will be rigorous and transparent, designed to find the best teachers, instill confidence in them, and be a representation of the high regard and respect in which they and their profession are held by society.

- The practice of assigning teachers to individual schools based on overall student-teacher ratios will be replaced by a much more careful assignment system based on the educational needs of the children.

-  In hiring school teachers, at all stages but particularly at the Foundational, Elementary, and Middle stages, strong preference will be given to local teachers and to teachers fluent in the local language, so that teachers may communicate easily with students, and with their parents and community members

- Teachers will be recruited to the district, as is done now in many States, and then deployed to the school complex, and then, as per school needs, to individual schools.

- Suitable incentives will be developed for excellent teachers to desire teaching jobs in schools in rural, tribal, and remote areas, where they are especially needed.

- Stopping the practice of para-teachers

- Induction of freshly trained teachers into schools. They will register with an authority, and then be inducted and integrated into the school complex.

###School environment and culture that is conducive to quality education

- All schools will be provided with adequate physical infrastructure, facilities, and learning resources, either individually or within their school complex.

- Schools will attempt to develop and demonstrate a caring, collaborative, and inclusive school culture

- There must be no interruption to school schedules so that teachers can use their work time to concentrate solely on and excel at their chosen professions.

- Remedial programmes will be established at all levels to help teachers in ensuring that all students are achieving their potential.

- Rejuvenating academic support institutions (SCERT, BITE, DIET, BRC, CRC, CTE, IASE)

- Teachers will be able to connect to the local community, to encourage self-governance

- Developing high-quality material for teachers and teacher educators in Indian languages, including tribal languages, will be accorded priority in order to ensure quality learning in the local language and thereby the inclusion of all students

###Continuous professional development

- Flexible and modular approach to continuous professional development for teachers

- Revamping continuous professional development

- Self-directed personal development of teachers

- Online resources for continuous professional development

- In-school teacher development processes

- Recognising outstanding teachers

###Career management

- Tenure track system

- Parity in service conditions across all stages of school education

- Professional progression via promotions and salary increases

- Clearly laid out professional standards for teachers will inform career progression of teachers. A common guiding set of National Professional Standards for Teachers (NPST) will be developed by 2022, coordinated by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) and NCERT

- Periodic (annual or higher frequency) performance appraisal of teachers

- Professional progression via vertical mobility

###Approach to teacher education

- Moving teacher education into the university system; the four-year integrated B.Ed. programme

- The two-year B.Ed. programme for lateral entry into teaching

- Specialised instructors for specialised subjects

- Closing down substandard standalone teacher education institutions

- Pedagogical aspects of the four-year integrated B.Ed. programme

- There is an urgent need for additional special educators for certain areas of school education

##Equitable and Inclusive Education

- Objective: Achieve an inclusive and equitable education system so that all children have equal opportunity to learn and thrive, and so that participation and learning outcomes are equalised across all genders and social categories by 2030.

*self note** read pages 138-139 to get historical context on inequalities, along with detailed studies by various institutions

###Upliftment of underrepresented groups in education

- Emphasis on the Policy actions for students from underrepresented groups

- Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones.

- Inclusive education in teacher preparation

- Alternate pathways for recruitment of teachers from URG

- PTR in schools with a high proportion of learners from URGs should not be more than 25:1.

- Establishing mechanisms to address discrimination, harassment and intimidation

- Eliminating exclusionary practices

- Sensitising learners

- Inclusive curriculum

- Up to date information for each student will be maintained in the National Repository of Educational Data (NRED). While some education indicators will be common to all URGs, specific indicators may be tracked for particular groups

- A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from URG

- Alternative means of support besides scholarships

- District-wise financial assistance

- Adequate financial and other resources for institutions

- Funding will be made available for independent research on inclusive education

- Coordinated and integrated policy implementation to support under-represented groups The new policy is extremely ambitious, but I am not sure the government will be able to succeed with this.

The changes to infrastructure required are massive, and require complete cooperation from all state governments, and the funding and skilled manpower requirements are enormous. The former may be achievable, but the latter is nigh impossible within the next ten years.

There's so much to point out, I don't even know where to start. But I will say this - free bicycles mean nothing when the rest of the traffic and traffic discipline is so bad. If anything student mortality will increase. They talk about redoing roads, but attaining ownership is going to be a royal PITA since a lot of politics will be involved in the land acquisition process.

The only way this policy seams achievable to me is if somehow the entire country unites under a single polity and opposition (good or bad) is completely obliterated. The latter is definitely not a good sign for the health of this country. 3 Major issues with this,

1) How are we going to teach science to kids in their mother tongue? Most of our languages invent words on the go and is also unreliable in case of shifting their states.

2) Why are teachers allowed to pick what subjects to teach and how they'll teach them? I thought allowing students more flexibility will help them more to think practical and get better at decision making.

3) Is this even theoretically possible to implement within a single decade? The only practical way I see it if it's done in a more decentralised fashion given the enormous size of our country.

Overall this policy seems very good so far and thanks for the post OP. 👍 Thank you for your efforts op. I am hopeful it works out. BJP has gotten majority for work like this. Any info on eliminating coaching classes? ##Efficient Resourcing and Effective Governance through School Complexes

- Objective: Schools are grouped into school complexes to facilitate the sharing of resources and render school governance more local, effective, and efficient.

###Ending the isolation of small schools through school complexes

- Multiple public schools will be brought together in an organisational and administrative unit called the school complex.

- Each school complex will be a semi- autonomous unit that will offer education from the Foundational stage (age 3-8 years) till Grade 12 

- The principal of the secondary school will be the head of the school complex. S/he will be endowed with administrative, financial and academic powers to oversee the coordinated development of all the schools within the complex.

###Better resourcing of schools through school complexes

- While each individual school will be resourced adequately for their basic functioning, school complexes can house shared facilities and equipment at the secondary school that cannot be provided separately to each individual school.

- Teachers can also be shared among the schools in the complex. Areas/subjects, which by the nature of the curriculum, do not require a teacher for every school

- Adequate numbers of social workers will be appointed to the school complexes depending on the student population and the population of adult learners in that geography

- While the teachers will have the central role in student care and well-being, each school complex will have one or more capable counsellors available.

- An administrative plan to enable this must be created urgently by the government for each school complex, and should be integrated in the development plan for the complex.

###Fostering integrated education through school complexes

- The requisite focus and emphasis on ECCE will be enabled through the school complexes - by providing academic, resource and administrative support to all public institutions engaged in ECCE within the geographic area of that school complex. 

- School complexes will collaborate with institutions such as ITIs, Polytechnics, etc., with local businesses (industry, service, agrarian, etc.), health centres and hospitals, artists and artisans, and those with expertise in local crafts and traditions, to offer a range of vocational education courses

- Every school complex will create the infrastructure necessary to ensure that appropriate support is available to all CWSN, within the complex.

- Universities, colleges, and polytechnics in the vicinities of schools will contribute to improving school outcomes using the capacities relevant to school education that they may have. 

- The CPD of teachers will be an important responsibility of the school complex.

- The academic and teacher support system, and its institutions, will be aligned to the school complex system by the DSE and the SCERT. This will include the CRCs, BRCs, BITEs, and DIETs.

- Individual State governments will group schools into complexes according to the population distribution, connectivity, and other local considerations.

- The process of organisation of schools into complexes will also be used as an opportunity to assess the status of infrastructure at all schools and to allocate adequate one-time funding to upgrade them.

- Each school complex will have an SCMC comprising representatives from all the schools in the complex.

- Only a small fraction of schools in the country have support staff associated with them, with the result that teachers are generally in-charge of everything, from the midday meal to accessing supplies for the school.

###Effective governance through school complexes

- The DSE will devolve authority to the school complex and each complex will be a semi- autonomous unit. 

- The culture of working to a plan, both short-term and long-term ones, will be developed across the leadership of all educational institutions.

- Each district will have a District Education Council — Zilla Shiksha Parishad (DEC/ZSP) for oversight of the functioning of the school system in the district, and to enable the functioning and empowerment of the schools, school complexes, SCMCs, and SMCs.

- A culture of rigorous planning and review will be established at all levels by the corresponding apex governing bodies; the SDP, SCDP, and DEDP will form the basis for such reviews.

###Effective governance and management of individual schools within school complexes

- Schools are social institutions. They are an integral part of the community and its development. It is this community - including the parents of current and future students - that have the greatest and most immediate investment in the school.

- Functioning of all schools (government/public, private- aided and private-unaided) will be supervised by the SMC, the constitution of which is mandatory since the enactment of the RTE Act

- Specific efforts will be made on a continuous basis, to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the SMCs.

- The SMC will play a central role in performance management of teachers and head teachers, by endorsing their evaluation and assessment, including the annual appraisal, as detailed in the section on teachers

- SMCs will be empowered to have a voice to intervene on behalf of the school with the State and its bodies.

- The head-teacher/principal will be the executive head of the school - with responsibility and authority over all academic and administrative matters, while being accountable to the SMC, for the educational outcomes of the school and for the probity of its functioning, as per norms set by the DSE and detailed in the SDP.

- Teachers and principals will continue to be responsible for working together as a team, and with the parents and community members, to steer their own institutions towards excellence.

###Regulation and Accreditation of School Education

- Objective: India’s school education system is invigorated through effective regulation and accreditation mechanisms that ensure integrity and transparency and foster quality and innovation for continually improving educational outcomes.

###System architecture and roles in the school education system

- States will separate the regulatory function from that of other functions in education, such as policymaking, school operations and education provision, academic development and assessment, and ancillary services. They will thus establish clear, separate systems for policymaking, regulation, operations and academic matters.

- The Department of Education of the State will be the apex policy making body and shall also be responsible for policy and the overall coordination and monitoring of the system.

- An independent SSRA will be established to handle all aspects of school regulation including the oversight of the school system and implementation of Accreditation

- The DSE, which is also called Directorate of Public Instruction in some States, will continue to be responsible for running the public school system

- This whole effort of transforming the DSE from a regulator cum operator of schools to only an (effective) operator of schools may require a project-like ‘change management process,’ over a period of 2-3 years - DSEs should develop a framework and plan for this change and create a highly competent and empowered team to enact this change.

- The State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT) will be the apex body on all academic matters including curriculum, textbooks, standards for teacher related processes (e.g. recruitment, development, evaluation and assessment), and learning standards for all stages of school education including early childhood education.

- The CRCs, BRCs, and DIETs will provide educational support to teachers and schools in their geographies, for all stages of school education including early childhood education, and for vocational education.

- Every State must have one or more Boards of Assessment (BOA) which conduct the assessment for the school leaving certificate and certify the same.

- Schools and schools system will have full flexibility to choose their curriculum.

- All bodies and institutions mentioned in this chapter will develop rigorous plans each year to guide their work.

###Accreditation for autonomy with accountability

- The SCERT will develop a School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Framework (SQAAF) for each State. 

- School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Framework and Licence to Start a School as the basis for accreditation based regulation

- On the basis of SQAAF, all schools must self-accredit, by giving details on their meeting all the basic parameters, and the relevant supporting documents.

- The SSRA will set up a mechanism of audit of accreditation.

- Public scrutiny of all information and supporting documents regarding all steps and processes of the accreditation system will be used as a key mechanism for oversight and accountability. Thank god/Bhagwan I studied in English. Good luck to next generation who will now learn technical subjects  in languages that for all practical purposes are spoken only in India .there goes a significant advantage that our workforce had - fairly passable English . Now that's look like an educational policy for a developed country. Excellent post.  However from what I understood, board exams 10, 12 are getting scrapped. How are college admissions conducted then? Also, this might create problems for students applying to foreign universities. How does this CCE, as mentioned in the post, work? Thanks, OP, for the summary. Many of these ideas are good on paper, but I am a bit worried about the overall tendency.

1. This is another example of centralised, high-modernist reform. Policy is made by some Enlightened Ones sitting up in Raisina Hill, and the rest of the country has to implement it. This kind of attitude has always led to poor results in India. If we look at other old policies (industrial policy, labour policy, health policy, etc etc), they also have these high-sounding modern ideas. They look good on paper, and fail miserably on the ground. In the process, *they blight the lives of millions*. We should learn from this, not duplicate these errors. In particular, we should think, ""Why have these other policies failed? Why will this new policy be any different?""
2. The requirements of Tamil Nadu are very different from those of UP. It is outrageous to imagine that the same policy could apply to both of them. The respective states should be able to set their policies that suit their distinct circumstances.
3. Hindi should not be given any primacy over any other language. Because of historical and demographic reasons, Hindi is one of the central government's *official* languages, the other being English. Note that Hindi is *not* a ""*national* language"" by law, but only an official language. India does *not* have a national language, and it has done very well without it. Now, if Hindi is sought to be imposed on Indians, it can only lead to bad outcomes.
4. The policy pits English against the mother tongue. This is a false opposition. English has been used in this country for a hundred years now --- Mughal princes were learning English as a part of their education in Delhi 200 years ago. Most of the middle class in India (about 300 million people, depending on how you count) have some understanding of it. *English is now an Indian language, and we should proudly own up to it, just as we are proud of Hindi and Tamil and Bangla and other languages.* If the parents wish that their child should learn English as their mother tongue (there are many families who converse in English), it should be possible.
5. The mother tongue should definitely be taught, and better than it is being taught now. But there are definite advantages to learning technical subjects in English. The knowledge of English has opened many doors for many Indians. I would suppose most of the people reading this thread on this forum have been beneficiaries, professionally and socially, of their knowledge of English. I have no objection to the mother tongue being taught, but English should not be seen as a villain that needs to be suppressed.
6. Finally, I feel that primacy in determining the education of children should lie with parents and with states. Let a variety of schools following different syllabii be available, and let the parents choose where to send their kids. States (perhaps in coordination with each other) should set minimum educational outcome standards for all schools to meet. Brilliant summary.

Also - whoever built this policy has done a great job. This is the kind of change that India  needs. Now all that remains to be seen is how this will be implemented. The tldr makes it seem absolutely brilliant. If it is and is implemented properly the props to the government. This was an epic read. Thanks for taking the effort to not only read through but summarize and compare! I'm honestly most confused about the shift in the medium of instruction. We already have Hindi-medium / <regional language> medium schools, which teach the same curriculum in a different medium of instruction. Now, what is the new policy aiming to do differently? Not to mention, with so much internal migration in India, the mother tongue differs a lot from the regional / State language for many people, and hence I don't understand what the proposal to teach technical and non-technical subjects in ""mother tongue"" means. Taking english away as primary language is no way practical. Learning so many languages would not be interesting for children because it might really serve no purpose as its only emotional attachment towards languages that persuade us to learn it at this point. 

Like all languages in the world only the test of time will tell you which ones survive. What I suggest is to add loan words to English from your local language. Like chaddi, hopefully it will get accepted into the dictionary. 

Mind you this a logical approach and I speak my mother tongue just fine. I am surprised that no news source is covering the extensive and welcome overhaul brought by this policy. Everyone is hellbount on beating the dead horse of hindi imposition even after the said section was changed. Apart from a few typos (which is okay), the write-up is superb. Gonna read the new draft and see if something constructive can be summarised which can be sent to the MoE/MHRD. Quality post OP, will read in my free time. ##Curriculum and Pedagogy in Schools:

- Objective: Curriculum and pedagogy are transformed by 2022 in order to minimise rote learning and instead encourage holistic development and 21st century skills such as critical thinking, creativity, scientific temper, communication, collaboration, multilingualism, problem solving, ethics, social responsibility, and digital literacy.

- old policy made the infamous 10+2 school system. Helped with modernisation and standardisation of schools, but sub-optimal

- New system must take into account cognitive developments of students, and cater to changing thinking styles with age

- New proposal: 5+3+3+4

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

- Foundation stage is whatever latest ECCE research demands, as discussed above

- Preparatory stage slowly introduces more formal education through textbooks, etc. More generalist teachers, lays groundwork for all subjects

- Middle stage introduces more specialisation, with dedicated specialised teachers. Discussion of abstract concepts

- Secondary stage is four years of multi disciplinary study, with greater depth, greater critical thinking, greater attention to life aspirations, and greater flexibility and student choice.

- All stages will heavily incorporate Indian and local traditions, as well as ethical reasoning, socio-emotional learning, quantitative and logical reasoning, computational thinking and digital literacy, scientific temper, languages, and communication skills, in a manner that is developmentally appropriate and in the curricular/pedagogical style that is optimal for each stage.

- Key thrust in all reforms is ""learning to learn""

- Reorientation of system to emphasise : critical thinking, creativity, logical deduction, collaboration/teamwork, social responsibility, multilingualism, quantitative reasoning, and digital literacy.

- Aims to enable students to learn from all curricula

- Current curriculum is overcrowded, as proved by 1993 MHRD Yashpal committee and 2005 NCF. Will need to remove some items from curriculum in favour of a more engaging, holistic, experiential, and analysis-based form of learning.

- Teaching will be more interactive

- Reduction in load allows students to go into more depth in subjects of their choosing

- All fields are very important (arts, crafts, engineering, science, sports, etc.)

- No ""extra-curricular and co-curricular"" vs curricular activities, everything is equally important

- Student empowerment and choice is necessary for holistic development

- Increased flexibility in choice of subjects, especially in secondary stage

- No hard separation of arts and sciences; and “vocational” and “academic” streams

- Language is fundamental to education. Children between 2-8 have excellent ability to learn multiple languages (and must learn at least one language in this time period). Science proves that mother tongue is the best language for education. Multilingualism has proven cognitive benefits

- Bilingual approach for those whose language is different from the primary medium of instruction. Teaching learning materials will be bilingual as necessary

- Exposure to three or more languages in schools

- Standardising sign language. Indian Sign Language will be standardised across the country

**self note:** Quote from the draft: *Despite the rich, expressive and scientific nature of Indian languages, there has been an unfortunate trend in schools and society towards English as a medium of instruction and as a medium of conversation. Logically speaking, of course, English has no advantage over other languages in expressing thoughts; on the contrary, Indian languages have been specifically developed over centuries and generations to express thoughts in the Indian scenario, climate, and culture. Moreover, Indian languages are very scientifically structured, and do not have unphonetic, complicated spellings of words and numerous grammatical exceptions; they also have a vast and highly sophisticated ancient, medieval, and modern literature in the Indian context; as a consequence, they have a certain home-feel and “apnaapan” quality in the Indian context, making them easier, more relatable, and more relevant for children and adults alike to learn and speak, and with which to learn and express deep concepts across school subjects.* cite: page 81-82, I highly suggest reading these two pages

- Hindi speaking states have not done a good job integrating the three language policy of 1992, for the sake of national integrity. The three language policy improves the status of Indian languages. Central and State govt. will both invest in 3 language policy, especially schedule 8 languages

- Special teachers to be recruited for teaching language

- Students will learn science in both local language and English, so that by grade 10, they can easily manage science in either language. This bilingualism has proven to help many Nobel price laureates

- Flexibility in choice of language

- Choice of foreign language as an elective during secondary school (Japanese, German, French, etc.)

- During elementary stage languages will be taught in fun, interactive and natural way, to support function. Inspiration will be drawn from Samskrita Bharati and Alliance Francaise. Reading in local languages will be enhanced to include authors from medieval to modern age

- Many countries have demonstrated that being fluent in one's own culture, history and language is very good

- Languages of India will be a course on history of Indian Languages

- Classical language and literature will be emphasised

- Many important languages like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Pali, Prakrit must be preserved

- History changing Sanskrit will be incorporated into teachings as and when necessary. Sanskrit available in all levels of school.

- All courses available in medieval languages of India

- 2 year course on medieval languages

- All students will have some common fundamental ""core subjects and skills""

###Curricular integration of essential subjects and skills

- Evidence based reasoning ans inculcating scientific temper are primary goals

- Arts must be more integrated, as people who are more creative are much better in many streams

- Music and art experiences in the early years. Experience classical (Carnatic or Hindustani), notes, scales, rhythms, ragas, etc. local folk music to also be emphasised. Simple instruments in pre-schools to allow students to experince music on their own

- Arts to include theatre, poetry, painting, drawing, sculptures, carpentry, etc. Aim is to create over time a strong community of artists. Will also preserve indigenous cultures and traditions.

- Taking up at least one art for deeper study

- Technology use for bringing the arts to more students

- Technology use for bringing the arts to more students It's really sad that information on major reforms like this is obscured by media houses and people protesting against (in some ways, rightfully so) the three language policy, which is only a small part of the overall reform. Great work OP, more people should see this. I'll do my best to circulate this information by any means possible.

Also, I've been hearing that the government is accepting suggestions and will modify the draft to include them. Any idea if a last date has been set for finalizing and implementation? This new policy looks really good , I hope it is implemented properly.
I specially like the idea of complexes, it will help teachers with niche skills to be better utilized and better pay

@op good work👍 I'm saving this. Thanks OP! Firstly, thanks so much for summarising the key points. 

Did the policy talk about sex education? From the brief read I did of your summary, I couldn't see that it did. 

Also, I think the policy looks great, and I'm looking forward to reading the whole thing when I have more time. Really nice post OP. Appreciate the effort you put in. Thanks very much for the write-up. Extremely informative! Compliments on the effort taken to present this in an understandable format.

Well Done and Thanks ! The idea is good. I hope they don't fuck up the execution bbut what will happen to:

my kid has to be an engineer so he has to go through 2-3 years of rigourous millitriesque coaching center grind so that he can take those 5000 seats out of 10 lakh participants in a hope to get a job with decent salary which are vanishing faster than congress seats in elections? Can anyone throw more light on how ethics and morality would be taught using a proper framework ? I am really impressed both by the policy itself and the effort you put into the summary. I only hope this can be implemented by the people in charge keeping personal egos aside. I really wish I could be brought up under such a policy. Although the whole policy is a much needed modern reform to our education system, my favourite thing is the emphasis of techanical education in regional languages. Look at all the advanced engineering countries.. >Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name.

So how will schools like Delhi Public School change their names? Will they just change it to Delhi School or something? OP, can you mention the page where I can find the ""English has hurt India"" text?

In my experience kids who do not learn English right from the beginning and try to pick it in later years (like say in third grade) never become fluent and confident enough. So I want to see what the committee argued. Thanks for the detailed post OP. Exceptional write-up, thank you for doing this. I am eagerly waiting for the next part. As someone who's going to college this year, will this new system affect me ? I plan on at atleast completing my masters. Good job with the post, I now see how you really mean it. Thanks for the excellent writeup. Ignoring the petty politics that will be obviously played by the parties, this policy is outstanding. A lot of these changes, especially getting rid of 10+2 is so good. Empahsis on fine arts, digital, ethics and philosophy is something we need so badly. Gonna be a herculean effort to implement though. Training new teachers, avoiding biases and politics, providing the infra, etc. is all gonna be big efforts. Hope they get done well. I have a doubt. Say, I am a malayali living in Tamil nadu. Will I be forced to learn technical stuff in Tamil? [deleted] I like that they're proposing to bring more freedom to choose your academic subjects. A lot of subjects I had during class 9-12 were irrelevant and redundant to what I wanted to truly learn and there were few ways to switch to a combination which I preferred.

CBSE also doesn't really make students aware of the large number of subjects available such as specialised vocational courses. My school teachers didn't know these subjects existed and did nothing to see that they're intergated into the present curriculum. Thanks for the write-up man. Really appreciate it.

Can I ask where in the draft is the proposition to make all private schools non-profit? I only found one mention and that doesn't seem to state it as a mandate. I kinda wish I'd been brought up in this system. Great write-up op . This will be great if implemented well.

Schools will not be for profit? I think this will cause some problems. There are many politicians with schools for generating profits. Extraordinarily forward thinking policies, but would've never seen this without your summary post OP. Thank you! My daughter goes to a Montessori School. I am looked at like a madman who is playing with the future if his child. The competition crazed Indians really cannot look at the big picture. Good to note that many of the concepts of Montessori ( and other similar ideologies) are incorporated into the draft policy.

What people need to realise is that education has to be fun for kids if it has to play a role in shaping their future. You cannot just put them in the meat grinder take away their childhood and expect them to excel. They may, but they come out the system as one dimensional adults.

Really hope the changes come to take place. Fuck you,Modi. English was literally the only thing India got going for it. Lol. Every single scientific journal is written in English. 

The only thing US companies find better in Indian companies when compared to China is the English language. Thanks OP for the hard work. I would have given you gold but don't have enough of it! thanks man for writing! I'm reading at 1:48 am and my eyes are glowing with hope and excitement with bit of regret ke thoda pahle peda hi Gaye! Still no sex education, the rest of it is great though especially:

> Arts, Sports, Music, literature, etc. are all now of primary importance, and each student **has to specialise in one of these**, in addition to courses of their choice Already commented, but I think this should be stickied for a week or two so people are aware of the country's education reforms. NEP should have implemented this long ago when CCE failed. Enjoy your gold. As an NRI student studying in an international Indian school ,I'm pretty curious how would they implement those here.
like we got almost all languages in India..
Hindi Urdu Malayalam Tamil Telugu are the most common..
IMO by the Grace God we got advanced features like Smart boards,labs etc which majority of pvt.cbseSchools here lack.
As our school is one of the largest in middle-east we are facing some rent difficulties as they have increased the rate..about 9million riyals I guess..
I'm sayin this becouse it was meant to be purchased from the kingdom by pm indira Gandhi (btw our girls section is situated on the land gifted by the kingdom authorities) .cuz of this we had to go through a tough time..
Btw I study at iisjed ksa.. What about people who have studied since primary in english medium and as a result only have basic understanding of this so called mother tongue(mine is hindi). 
Am i supposed to magically learn it for and do a whole translation for everything i have learnt up till now? Hey. Thanks for the summary.

Had a small doubt, does the RTE get benefited under the education policy? One thing to keep note of is resistance to change, it will be hard for those old teachers and unmitovated one's. >The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. 

Hell yeah! Holy fuck. This new system doesn't feel Indian at all Great post,man. The NEP looks great too,hope govt passes it this year only. Big Bang PR reforms. 

There are 2 parts of this plan which are excellent and will have more impact than most others -

1) Including breakfast in the meal plan

2) More focus on studying in the mother tongue.


The key issue with education, is that there are FAR too many factors which impact outcomes. 

The short version is that if society improves, education improves.

That's why feeding kids is the biggest deal, and one of the key reasons any improvement in attendance has been seen. 

Mid-Day meal schemes are the model the world learned from third world countries and implemented in their schools.


However, the biggest issue will always be 

1) Jobs : As long as there is a strong economic incentive for a student or family to choose an economically sensible path over a good student-subject match (arts students) - people will take subjects they are bad at. 

They will get bad grades, and since they need the grades to pass - they will cheat.


2) Student teacher ratio issues: With 50 students to 1 teacher, we are FAR away from getting people to do well in school. One on One coaching has had one of the biggest impact on student performance in experiments (other than exercise and nutrition).

3) The difficulty of ascertaining intent and testing: With 50:1 students to teachers, each teacher has to go through millions of exams papers.

Exam papers are at leas solvable with those constraints. Match contents with subject material. Adjust for language and content.


Move to a more vague system that requires teacher judgement, and time taken to check results goes up FAST.

This increases costs, often increases reagent requirements, and results in teacher inability to examine. Pg: 83

This is a disaster in making. Force feeding three languages to pre-primary to Grade 2 students is nothing but torture. This will fall hard. 

There is absolutely no need of third language in school. STEM should be taught in English only and rest in state's local language. If you don't then middle-class parents will always hunt for schools that offers full english medium instruction as they are doing now in all tier 1 & 2 cities.

pg 84:
> It is well-understood that young children learn and grasp nontrivial concepts most quickly in their home language/mother tongue.

Also this very notion of mother-tongue based education will help is plain wrong. We live in a very pluralistic society and workplace today. If a Gujarati/Bengali family works in B'lore or H'bad will their kids get Gujarati/Bengali lecture in school in those cities? You get instructions in English and are forced to take local language or Hindi as 2nd language.

Bottomline...Will Mr. Modi spend 10% of GDP on education? I have doubt.

I have with few Chinese and Vietnamese in my team. They & their kids are fluent in English. [China investing heavily in English](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anismuslimin/2017/11/30/why-asian-countries-are-investing-so-heavily-in-the-english-language/#5b51c2895e85) and here we are planning to push Sanskrit & Hindi and sideline English. Astrology and vastu shastra are not mandatory? Surprising.. I am contemplating so many ways they will fuck it up.

Lucky I passed out early. 

Ez. Focus on mother tongue is a step backwards IMO.

Most students right now suffer from a *lack* of English language.


Science and Maths are also are primarily ENGLISH subjects. Not because muh antinationalism but because Europe developed those languages and not us.

Studying in local languages will fuck you up when you aim for more sepecific and higher level branches within each of those subjects. This is brilliant!
I kind of agree with Hindi and English being taught all over, it certainly helps if people move to different states. Also, mother tounge us usually taught at home, so it's not as if one is losing the grasp of his/her mother tounge unless things are different at home. with 11 + 4 -  one cannot go for MS as..GRE needs 16 years of education FFS",2019-06-03 22:16:45

Sports,"Daily sports period must, says CBSE",330,8eg6k3,http://www.thehindu.com/education/schools/daily-sports-period-must-says-cbse/article23638683.ece?utm_campaign=socialflow,69,,LondonCapital," Hopefully these periods won't be annexed by the more ""important"" subjects like science and math. I remember most of my sports periods used to be stolen by these teachers between 9th to 12th grade because if we don't prepare for board exams we'll be failures in life. Bc mazaa aa jata mere time mein. Three lousy games period per week isn't enough to play football.  

Let us say there is 1 football, 1 basket ball and 1 volley ball and 1 cricket ground available in a school.

Maximum number of children that can play = 22+10+12+22 = 66 i.e. 1 section of a class.

Maximum 8 sports period = 8*66 = 528.

I doubt any school has only 528 students.

So we have this guideline 

>  but will be free to perform any physical activity 

And so we basically have extra lunch period. In 11th, 12th, my school gave us a games period everyday, from 3-3.30. And our PT teachers would allow us to extend it till 4.30. The best decision taken by the school ever, imo

The juniors were so lousy they'd prefer to sit in their classrooms and jerk off Ok.. But before that playground should be mandatory for all schools.. Some schools don't even have a playground and without a playground what do you do in the sports period ? Play snakes and ladders ? Saar, yeh sports kya hota hai ??
People need to realise that 9-5 job with shit boss and no love for your work is waaaaaay better than actually following your passion Tbh, I was a failure in sports in school. Every 'sporting event' we had, I came last. While my friends were supportive, every 'sports' period where we were asked to do something bought me great anxiety and dread. The Sports teachers gave me single digit marks and fucked up my internals.

Behenhchod kuch bhi nahi hota tha theek se, Football khelta tha, defending me hagta tha. Goalkeeping karu tab bhi goal nahi ada sakta tha. Cricket me duck pe out or can't defend a boundary. Volleyball me service net ke upar se gaya toh bahot badi baat hoti thi. Mc running events me bhi last.

It's not like I'm obese or horribly out of shape; I have an average build, and was even among the taller ones in my peers. I simply suck at every sport. Had this been implemented when I was in school, I would have been pretty stressed. bc harr roz anxiety aur embarrassment.

I'm not against this either, it was good to get out of the class and hang out. Sometimes we used to play an uneducated form of rugby which basically involved tackling people randomly. i'm just giving my perspective. I hated even the one period of PE per week we had. This would have been the stuff of my nightmares.  Good for eyes, good for physical and mental health. But many schools in city limits lack own playground, and share with other schools, so that can be one problem [deleted] We had just one game period per week and even then teachers would try to hijack it for shitting on us. Assholes.. In my time any period in 11th/12th was a sports period if we wanted it to be. Also known as lunch break 2 in my days. Our school had a sand instead of grass for a football field and our goal posts were actually perpendicular to each other.This was a reputed KV in a Tier-2 city. 
As soon as we started playing, all the sand was flying in the air, every other day or so the football would find itself out of the field, in someone's house.
No coach would ever teach a thing to anyone, never, despite having round 3-4 PT/sports teachers.Forget about teaching anything related to PT, fitness, nutrition etc.
 
In the middle of the field there used to be people playing cricket, volleyball and badminton all at one place, this was one giant clusterfuck.
Not only this, they used to make 2-3 classes play on the same field (50avgX3)simultaneously, so basically people running here and there like madmen fights happening every other minute, others were busy trying to flirt with girls who never ever participated in sports.

The real kicker is that our school actually had a standard sized outdoor basketball court, not one, but 'two' badminton courts, a room with two standard table tennis courts and all the sport equipment in the world which was kept new and shiny until the day the school inspectors would arrive, when magically the equipment was put into use and hid immediately as the inspection ended.These guys used to take away anyone cricket bat and put it into the sports room.

Later, we also had a Gymnasium, which again I never saw anyone visit.
They only rare times they would let anyone use the facilities was when they knew the inter-school competitions were coming up and only those students would be allowed to use them who already used to take private sports coaching outside of school,  wtf? man. I still remember me and my buddies who were bored with shitty lecturers trying to participate in TT and being told to fuck-off, one of my buddies was actually good at it, but never got a chance. ""Daily sport period"" was just a myth for us... we had only 1 sport period in a week...and in most of the case it was either abandoned by rain or by other subject teachers... Tfw sports teacher would pussy out to some arrogant academic teacher who would eat up the only happy thing about schools. Luckily I used to spend 2 hours almost everyday for sports practice :D
An hour every morning for athletics (i was allowed to skip those boring assemblies) and an hour before leaving for football/basketball practice. Bhosdike hafte me ek ""sports"" perid lagate hain fir olympic ke time be hai\-tauba machate hain ki medal kyu nahi aa rahe. Us ek ghante me koi dusra master kabza jama leta hai aur 90&#37; se zyada time to  kabhi koi sports ka saman nhi mila hoga jaha tak mujhe yad hai. This happened to me in KV around 15 years ago....don't know about today's conditions in KV! How is sports period in schools nowadays anyway. Back in my day, it was 20 minutes of marching for some reason, then the PE instructor would toss some worn out ball at us and go sit in the bleacher under the shade for the rest of the period while we did whatever.  yes, until some math teacher wants you to cover her syllabus plan P.S. Schools without adequate sports facilities can send their students to the nearest shakha.   Bc even in the picture you can see the posture is completely wrong. Can lead to hamstring pain and lower back issues 


Making something compulsory is fine and dandy at least  make sure you have teachers that are educated and actually give a shit.  Meh. These rules won't even be followed. Remember how CBSE said coaching institutes can't run integrated school programs with CBSE schools? Nothing happened. FIITJEE still has their 2 year Pinnacle program going strong. Most city schools in Chennai don't even have playgrounds. We used to play in the government ground in the adjoining street.  Why only sport? Why not esport too?

Football lack the glory at the moment. ISL and football are not mutually intelligible, ISL is simply a poison to Indian football and will kill off what's left of the i-League. They've done almost nothing to grassroots football and even if they do these players won't be allowed to move overseas for experience. The current grassroots program is just done for namesake. As a foreigner who travels to India sometimes

&#x200B;

IPL attracts the best players in the world - it truly is a spectacle and a global brand

ISL is a few no-name players kicking a ball about in a folorn, dusty stadium

there is no comparison It's commercial, man.

DO WATCH [this video](https://youtu.be/twtDPR-Y1xQ) where soccer and baseball are compared. And all the things are applicable for cricket vs. soccer.

Main points-

* Harder to be #1 in soccer since many countries are playing. You are always #1 in baseball.

* Soccer has only one break. Even that is too short for commercials. In today's capital driven economy, this is extremely important for a game to be commercially lucrative to big corps.

Et cetera. In my opinion, we need to take I-League to the position of IPL. It is only football league in the country that has grassroot level organisation and follows international norms of association football.

I see many people in the country passionately follow EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga etc. But they cannot do the same with I-League. There is very little media coverage of the tournament and is not advertised on sports media as with the case with IPL.

I've seen some local channels show I-League matches but big channels (like Star Sports or ESPN etc) hardly cover it. These channels draw the majority of sport-lovers' TRP, and I-League doesn't get a fair share.

I think if at least the online media (like Hotstar) could show I-League matches regularly, it might become a bit popular. Stadiums need to be cleaned up too. If we can so beautifully design our cricket stadiums then why not the football ones too? 

The one thing we can all understand is football is not unpopular in India. Millions tune up to watch the World Cup every four years. Lakhs watch EPL, La Liga etc. We need to elevate the position of football in our country.",2019-09-08 21:14:10

I cry every time people complain about Michael Owen's punditry. We don't even have that here. At least he occasionally makes legitimate observations.  Chhetri is a poor analyst, has a feeble shaky voice and it feels like he stutters while he speaks, he doesn't but it feels like it.


The host is a total douchebag, his face just emanates douchebaggery. Sony has always been shit OMG, their green screen set is so shit.  Sony is one of the worst sports channels ever.  
For a generation which grew up on European football with masters like John Dykes, that Joe Footy guy is as bad as the IPL jokers running around talking idiotically.  
Why is he even there? Coz he has a generic white guy face?   
The panel also does not work at all, provide no great insight into the game (partly due to the host being an unfocused idiot), mostly do not have ANY statistical homework done, never show anything other than plain, simple highlights.   


This WC has been one of the best (for viewers) in India and these idiots are out happily ruining the greatest prospect India has for this sport to REALLY take off right now.  
Just take Joe Footy out to the barn and shoot him and get hire Mr Dykes. Hahaha. Agree with you.  David James is such an horrendous expert. Hindi one is nice. They joke and laugh. 50 rupaye me itnaich milega. Agreed. The host is the worst I have seen in a long time Who remembers World Cup 2006's Hindi commentary? For a couple of matches it was the only option.

I still remember the commentator calling Portugal, Po-tu-re-gaal. Haha. Atleast they've come a long way from having John Abraham as a football pundit. The host is an absolute cunt who doesn't give a rat's ass about the show are the viewers. The guests are atrocious, didn't even like Chhetri or Sandhu as pandits. From the guys who brought you John Abraham. Is football mundial still up? I don't have too many complaints about it.  [removed]",2018-07-03 22:11:04

Btw who made it? Could someone confirm it is indeed mumbai metro? It seems like a whatsapp forward to me, reason being why NBA would spend in advertising in a country where it is a minority game! What is nba? Shot by which camera? Really cool. They should do this in metros of other cities too. nice. I understand why they want Indian fans but do they genuinely expect people in India to empathise with teams from another part of the world for a sport which isn’t even popular in India? Mumbai metro has pretty amazing advertising. If you notice closely, they have drawn the basketball court on the floor. No wonder it’s empty! We want cricket not basketball!!",2019-05-08 01:52:05

Sports,Do people get socially / personally alienated because they're not interested / scared of pets?,20,d94q1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d94q1l/do_people_get_socially_personally_alienated/,41,"Over the past few months (and over the course of the last couple of years) I have noticed that an not having an overwhelming affection for dogs, cats and all assorted pets is a rather significant factor in maintaining relations with friends and family, dealbreakers when it comes to dating and possibly relations too. 

[ *""i'm a mother / father of 2 doggos""* ; *""if there's a doggo in your pic i'm dating you and stealing that good boi""* ; **the evergreen classic** *""doggos over humans any day...""* ; *""if my cat likes you, only then you have my approval...""* ; the deluge of appreciation tweets & posts on Instagram / Facebook; now the rise in posts in this very sub over the past week and many, many more...]

Dating apps have women and men displaying overwhelming affection for their pets. I've personally been unmatched and (digitally) broken contact with on a couple of occasions because I straight up admitted that i'm not too keen about pets (specifically dogs). 

[that i'm kinda scared of dogs in general due to a childhood mishap with a pet dog is a whole other issue altogether - growing up I've managed to control my fear/worry and while I don't exactly start screaming when in close proximity to a dog, I do look visibly panicked]

i'm not exaggerating when I say a potential marriage alliance was completely nipped in the bud because of the fact that she had a tattoo of her pet dog and I clearly admitted that i'm not a fan of having a pet / pets in the future. My entire existence as a human being and all my joys and sorrows, education, academics, work experience, sporting and personal achievements were instantly invalidated in a flash - because of this viewpoint.

while I clearly and obviously do not have an issue with folks having pets at their homes and the visible rise of pet friendly public spaces. cafes & restaurants - any attempts at trying to meet at non pet presence(d??) places is met with a lot of derision and straight up hostility. 

I understand that folks with pets treat them as nothing short of family members - but their decision to stay away from actual human beings; avoid and have a low opinion of those who are averse to pets - is rather confusing and if I may admit to it - a bit hurtful as well. I've missed out on a couple of social & personal relations because of this and I really do think it rankles.

Am I only one being overtly sensitive to this situation or is this an actual thing?",PuneriPerson," Along with being a foodie, wanderlust, sapiosexual etc., love of pets has been a forced trend of sorts. This sub too caught on that trend lately. 

Getting out of marriage is understandable if they strongly want a pet and you are totally against it. However, alienating people just because they don't like pets is taking things to the extreme. I think if you are a nice person in general, people will like you. If someone makes a massive deal out of you not liking animals, you're better off without them. I mean, avoiding or ostracising people over something they like (interests like animals, movies, etc.) don't like is a very shallow and childish way to behave.

I knew a person who hated pets. Or any animals. I and a lot of people disliked her, but not for her hating animals. She was just an asshole in general. Regarding the marriage alliance, why would she want to be with someone who doesn't want the same things in life? For her, her pet dog was probably more important than some random person. Obviously, she's gonna reject the person who has clearly told her that he doesn't want pets. Many Animal lovers won't spare a change to a poor kid, won't buy him a meal but would spend lakhs on their dogs. Petting an animal is ok but when you equate a dog's life with a human's life, I don't want to do anything with you.

These fucking assholes would feed the stray dogs inside the building complex. Those stray dogs kept coming inside and started barking at soceity members. If you're feeding a dog, do it outside.

A couple of months ago, couple of stray dogs killed a kid and these fucking assholes had the gall to put blame on him saying that dogs are loyal, they won't harm you. Fuck that shit. They won't take new stray dogs nor their NGOs will do that but won't let the officials kill them. Wtf. I had to physically fight off these stray dogs when I was a kid with a bat.

Haven't you heard of Karen's who live with their cats when they're old as they couldn't find someone who could love them? Yeah, I have seen couple of those in Mumbai.

If you want to maintain your sanity, I'd advise you to stay away from them. Couples in the west divorce over pets. Let these cunts die with their catshit.

I just stay away from them and let them do what they want.

Edit : This is mostly for cats and dogs. I'm fine with rabbits, parrots, birds etc. I had a parrot as a pet. I share the same feeling. Infact i once had a heated argument about it.
I am still not sure about the ethical issue here. So a rich lady with a fancy dog won't spare a single penny for the hungry kid outside her car window in a traffic light signal. 
I have seen people spending over 20k on their dogs monthly and not a single penny for charity. I don't understand this behaviour. The social capital of a human is anyday greater than dogs, i believe. I may be wrong here though. Do you live in india ? Because I haven't came across such hardcore dog or cat lovers here . I would say animal hierarchy in our country goes like this 
1. Cow
2. Other domestic animals like Buffalo's
3. Dogs
4.lion
5.elephant
6.tiger
Never met a cat lover in my entire life [deleted] Its just a class divide mechanism used by the upper class to differentiate them with the middle class and lower class. You have got a valid point.

But I think overcoming your fear is also one way. You can do it , try getting along with pups first.

Whatever you choose later will be your own , but giving in fear won't do any good. Dogs and cats are hella pure and yeah if you aren’t good with animals I’ll lose a little trust in you. 

Shouldn’t really stop anyone from being your friend or getting into a relationship but yeah get yourself to a blue cross and try to work with a few animals (:",2019-09-25 23:18:04

Sports,Pro Kabbadi - From indigenous sport to India's most admired non Cricket league,22,9qovya,https://www.insidesport.co/pro-kabaddi-from-indigenous-sport-to-indias-most-admired-non-cricket-league/,26,,Cricketloverbybirth," From the article

> over the years, the league has emerged as the second most-watched professional sports league behind the IPL. According to the data and stats by Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) India, PKL was pegged to be the popular non-cricket property with season 4 contributing to 61 per cent of the total viewership share among the leagues other than IPL.

> PKL Season 5, being the most successful season ever, garnered 1.6 billion impressions form the live telecast on seven channels of Star Sports cluster. The finals of the season 5 clocked in 25.4 million impressions compared to 18.9 million in season 4, marking a 34 per cent growth.


Kabbadi has become the second most popular sport in India in no time after living in infancy for several decades despite being an indigenous sport to India. Due to PKL which contributes over 60% of non Cricket viewership every year, it has surpassed football by a long margin. Urbanites here might have little idea but rural India (majority in India) contributes over 70% of league's viewership which has made it surpass it's football rival ISL by a massive margin, Facts are facts!",2018-10-23 21:19:21

Sports,[NP] The Indian Sports scene has improved drastically in the last few years. What changed?,195,8b4qi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8b4qi7/np_the_indian_sports_scene_has_improved/,71,"India has been doing well in Badminton, Boxing, Hockey, Shooting, Football, Weight lifting, Table tennis, Kabaddi etc., in the last few years. People have started showing interest towards these sports never like before. 

For a country that has always been very 'cricket' centric, what has changed in these years?",whackybrain," I follow few of the sports you mentioned.

Badminton - Saina was already performing well. Kidambi, Prannoy, Sindhu, Sai were all expected to perform well. Satwik/Chirag is the only newfound guys. Basically we're seeing the results of Gopichand's efforts.

Boxing - New wave of boxers. Also from what I understand we were doing better early too, but the association problems was an issue. New association gives stability. Also foreign coaches(Santiago Nieva -men's team and Raffaele Bergamasco- was youth and junior in-charge, after Youth World Championships success, now in charge of seniors too i believe). Still on senior level, at least in men's category, we're not at world standard.

Shooting - The new generation of shooters coming in should be credited to Bindra. He really inspired the kids. Also the facility has improved. Many new academies. Shooting is where we're going to be really good. Only problem i see is other than shooters who come from army background, it's really rich people sports.

Weightlifting - Other than Saikhom Mirabai Chanu and Jeremy Lalrinnunga, none is world class. But with every tournament, lifters are only improving, not going backwards. I believe the national coach Vijay Sharma is pretty good.

Table tennis - Massimo Costantini(national) is doing really good. And most junior players are inspired from Sharath Kamal Achanta. But none of our tt players are world class. The juniors Archana Kamath and Manav Takkar is doing good in junior circuit, but still wont defeat top 5 of Chinese/Japanese players. 

TLDR; Foreign coaches, funds. Efforts from star players who's inspiring new generation. And fantastic work done by OGQ,Gosports and obviously Indian army(weightlifting, boxing etc). And there is a long way to go. Commercial houses sponsoring these events. Privatization of leagues like ISL, Kabaddi, PBL (Premier Badminton League), Super Boxing League has resulted in athletes getting a lot of exposure to foreign coaches, learning new techniques and keeping themselves supremely fit.

Also, a little credit to the government who has actively supported these ventures.

Moreover, a lot of athletes are getting corporate and commercial sponsorships, enabling them to compete in almost all the tournaments around the world, thereby giving them precious practice against the best. Around **150 athletes** preparing for Tokyo Olympics, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games, **were provided Rs.50,000 monthly stipend from September 2017**.

Its not a only thing, but surely would had helped those atheletes who don't have stable income source and also concentrate on their diets and training.

Link - https://www.news18.com/news/sports/top-athletes-to-get-monthly-stipend-of-rs-50000-1519295.html Some great media stories about Saina Nehwal/PV Sindhu, Vijender Singh, Abhinav Bindra, ISL, Pro Kabaddi League and some other factors are responsible. Don't base this on the CWG. It hardly has strong competition in weight lifting, wresting, shooting etc. In Asian games and the Olympics, we still come short. Most of these still do not have that much widespread popularity. As for football/soccer, it has already been more popular than cricket in West Bengal/Assam for a long time. No sport is at the same level as cricket because none of them give the same level of fame or money. As far as football is concerned, it will take a long time before we are at par with European/Latin American teams. Off topic but 4-5 people from my school featured in the Khelo India competition and got the whole school interested in other sports like Basketball and Squash rather than the standard Cricket and Football. Some of the reasons listed here are spot on. Another reason is that there is often a psychological barrier that people face, and once one person breaks through, everybody realizes that they too can do it.


For example, the four minute mile was considered the limit for a very long time. Then one athlete broke through that, and soon enough many followed.


Indian children after seeing that other India s they look up to are performing well, now believe that they can do it as well. You can read the book called the talent code by Daniel coyle who goes into detail about this.


It also explains why we're so damn good at cricket. Progress has always been there but inconsistent that's why we saw the dip in Rio 2016.  
  
You have to understand, CG, Asian Games, World Championships and Olympics are events where athletes get primed to perform at their peak.  There's still a significant difference in the quality of playing field in CG and Asian Games. However, it's the progress in between these events that shows you the true improvement of players (qualification, personal bests, participation in 'A' category of events etc).  
  
**Table Tennis:** Traditionally not a force to be reckoned with. Kamal is definitely an inspiration and has been carrying the Indian team for a long time. However, Manika Batra's win over the World No 4 is probably a career defining for her as well as Indian TT. UTT league also led our players to rubbing shoulders with their  international counterparts leading to a general improvement in their games.  
Most of them play in the European club circuit for further training and enhancing their game.  
  
**Badminton:** Structured programme. Sponsors. Vimal Kumar. Gopichand - Left the game at an early age after winning the All England Championships due to frequent injuries and lack of infrastructure. Setup his own academy.  
With India becoming one of the newest powerhouses of badminton, there's increased media attention as well. Also, PBL helps. 
 
  
**Shooting:** India was always a powerhouse though doesn't have the Olympic medals to show for it. Heena Sidhu, Jeetu Rai, Gagan Narang are World champions and always contenders for these clashes. However, the new youngsters cropping up is a delight to watch. This could be due to our improved showing in Olympics, role models (Bindra, Kumar etc), infrastructure improvement and OCQ among others. Still an elite sport though.  
Bindra might be pulling off something like Gopichand in shooting a la, his own academy.
 
  
**Weightlifting:** Were pretty strong, if not medal winning, mid-2000s and before. Administration and doping issues. The Indian Weightlifting Federation has had frequent and regular skirmishes with the International WF wrt to doping etc including blanket bans. Seems like we have a clean contingent after a fairly long time.  
Realistically, Chanu was a huge medal hopeful in Rio 2016. Missed all her attempts. 
  
**Athletics and swimming** seem to have a lot more to catch up due to various factors: infrastructure, administration, physiological, financial and others.  
Although, individually PT Usha and a host of other coaches are really upping the notch. 
 There's also the javelin prodigy Neeraj Chopra to look forward to. 
  
**Kabaddi:** I believe, purely due to the pro Kabaddi league, not sure we follow the national team's performances as closely as we watch PKL. India, as it is, are the champions in all the three World Cups played.  
  
**Football:** Not that it wasn't already popular, ISL just woke up the dormant football fans having to just follow PL, La Liga etc  to getting good quality home grown football. Have been making significant strides under Constantine.  
  
**Hockey:** Doing pretty well since the last 5 years or so, except that we still lack the big game mentality and falter on the world stage. Still a hugely competitive team with quality players. Have come a long way since we failed to qualify for Beijing 08.  
  
Overall, still a huge way to go. Lots of administration problems today as well.  
The media's barometer of success (read fickle) cannot and shouldn't reflect the true state of Indian sports, however insignificantly negative or positive it might actually be.  Strategically, this was bound to happen. 

India is a huge market, really huge. And, the people are entertainment-starved. Out of the billion plus population (excluding infants, adolescents and very old persons) , even if a hundredth part are interested in a sport , that is 10 million people for you, larger than many nations.

Now, you just marry the two. Infow of money in the meanwhile also props up the quality of sports. To sum up, as income levels in India keep growing, you will see more sports getting developed and organized like kabaddi, badminton in recent years. Sports ministry headed by a sportsperson?  I dont think you were following our performance in last Asian Games & Olympics. Believe i or not, but we have actually regressed from the height of 2012 London Olympics. return on investment takes time to fruition...and there is a lot of corporate money being invested in athletes and sports infrastructure thru which we'll reap even better results in the near and coming future.. The main thing is money, plain and simple. Once IPL proved to be a huge commercial success, a lot of other leagues sprouted up. And when different sports are actually being promoted people tend to get interested in them We've always done well in CWG - because there's simply not much competition. Wait until the Olympics and we get owned by every tiny ass European country.  Our tally actually went down during the last Olympics. Ache Din Khelo India program by Modiji.. Only thing that changed. Credit where it is due. /s Besides the other things mentioned, one lesser change I think deserves mention is the sports we focus on. Earlier too, India excelled in non-cricket sports like Hockey. The trouble is that only means one medal. Alternately, with weightlifting, wrestling, boxing and shooting, there are dozens of medals on offer. So Indians shifting focus to these games has meant they are winning many more medals. 

We can win a lot more if we focus on athletics and swimming.  Paisa Historically speaking as a country starts doing economically well it reflects in their sports performance (see China's ascent and Russia's descent in recent history). Probably because people are not existing hand to mouth anymore and have time and resources to spend on sports. just remember that the CWG is a very localized competition - and even on that scale the numbers are not really impressive. 

 Nutrition mostly imo  Once someone breaks a barrier , more people starts following you. That's what happened. India won a world cup in cricket and that's when people started following cricket so much. And probably cricket was the only sport until then in which we had a world cup. But since we started getting gold in other sports , people started following these sports as well. I remember very well when Saina Nehwal won an Olympic medal suddenly Badminton following increased. Same is happening with other sports and I couldn't be more happy. I'm a Volleyball guy and as any other sport , there are certain barriers. For example , Height is an important factor in Volleyball and while Rest of the world's average is about 5.9/10 ft. India has about 5.6ft height average. I hope there will be a day when India starts excelling in Volleyball as well. Common Wealth Games. India always does well.. Even during shitty 1988 or something I remember India winning lots of gold medals.  Football has only improved little. Lot more grassroots level investment can only get you any improvement. Even our best clubs like BFC arent the best even in Asia. Honestly we arent athleatic enough to compete in football on global stage like the WC.  Fitness and food habits.  The reception. 
Younger generations have started liking non-cricket sports. There is a huge fan base for football, badminton, tennis etc. 
As reception has increased so the number of viewers and players and effectively sponsorship.  Let's have discussion on the same topic after Tokyo 2020. But why no love for e-sports or for that matter, airsoft ? E-sports is also slowly coming up, which is nice.  Narendra Modi. >What changed?

People started moving away from that boring, pathetic colonial sport that had built unreasonable hype to the point of indoctrination and hero worship, among the population. And are starting to learn that in fact, that lame-ass game called cricket is not the only pro-sport to exist.

Eventually, slightly better facilities were created for them, media started delegating some time to these sports from the usual hourly worship sessions for the Indian cricket team. The result was even more positive exposure to the public for these sports, and some recognition for the hard-working people who play and take part in them.

That's what happened. We are still far from ideal situation though. People started caring less about cricket",2018-04-10 11:49:33

I mean cannot the people behind this do some productive work. Let me know your thoughts on this.
",_chota_bheem," Honestly, if they had any productive work to do they won’t be doing this. Sometimes when it comes to certain celebrities, like Salman Khan, I think the whole celebrity worship thing has gone too far with people literally defending anything and everything that a celebrity does. I have seen and heard a few people having a war of words with others when a group discussion turned towards Sachin Tendulkar’s low Rajya Sabha attendance. These “fans” literally started throwing personal abuses in what began as a civil discussion. Don’t even get me started on the few football “fans” I know. I am not much of a sports follower and I don’t watch or follow any of them.. once I mentioned in a group that I find football boring to watch and the rest is history. The worshipping has gone so far that a mere hint of criticism will bring their wrath upon you. Edit: It’s not just celebrities these days that are being worshipped like crazy, now it is quickly catching on to corporates like Apple , Microsoft, Google and also your YouTubers.  Even the local telly actors have fan pages. That apart , recently I met an entrepreneur who owns a company which enhances the social media profile of a person or entity. He was saying how they start fan pages in an organized way and how they retain a memory of personality in social media space , especially when they have something upcoming.  Celebrity worship is not specific to India. Happens all over the world.  You should check Ronaldo/Messi, Federer/Nadal fan pages. Massive paint-brushing, the majority of the country doesn't watch or have time for worshipping
  God/s have the biggest fan bases.  Ignore. Move on.  These so called celebrities thrive on such people. I never understood the need to get so emotionally attached to them. A doctor or an army guy does much for you than these shameless people who think they're above everyone else...they're in fact so cut off from the public / a normal way of life with their money power and bodyguards and private gyms and mansions and what not..
Wake up people...they're just doing a job just like everyone else...just like you...just like me  Ever seen a Muller or Harry Kane fanpage? It's part of saviour complex in our ego. A Common Indian man strive for validation in the society. When he sees a public figure, he tries to replicate him/her but fails. So, he incorporates his ideas and projects his own ego on the ideal. His psyche is now bipolarised by two  conflicting egos. he doesn't have any choice other than circlejerk on him to pacify his new ego from old ego. I think the ""celebrity worship"" has always existed. It might be more in-your-face now due to the time people ""live"" in the virtual world. Our social media addictions have given rise to social media based businesses where the brand value of the celebrity is ""enhanced"" to fit into his target demographic. A Virat Kohli is a purported youth icon and his image is cultivated accordingly, although what the youth is actually learning from him can be debated endlessly. A Ranveer Singh image is cultivated to be loud and brash to cater to his audience. These images are based on typical stereotypes which our society is comfortable with. 
A Nicki Minaj is worshipped in the US, but is not marketable in India (racism, misogyny whatever you might call it).
Worshipping something/someone we feel superior to ourselves is our cathartic release. It speaks to the core of us when we yearn to surrender ourselves to a higher power/cause. And when we see others imitating this behaviour, we naturally find solace in numbers. 

Most of us are insecure. 
After watching all of your friends, families and acquaintances on social media leading perfect lives, it makes us even more insecure and we attach ourselves to a cause we think is bigger than ourselves and we find it soothing to be easily identifiable as someone. 

Our attention spans have also plummeted. Is it even worth my time to get to know a person's opinion and to empathise with his/her feelings, to try and make sense of him? Or is it just easier to become part of a herd and to point out and ridicule anyone who is not?
We place a lot of store on individualism (may be due to the American media propagating the philosophy I over collective) but we seldom practice it in our lives. We lead hollow lives while suppressing our feelings and we laugh hollow laughs. 
Self-introspection? Aint nobody got time for that. 

I am sorry if this went on and on, like a school lecture about ancient history but most of this is from my own life. Every day that i live and breathe, i move away from knowing who i truly am. I travel around the world but i never take the only journey that gives meaning to my existence. 
To know my purpose, i must know me. But in this haze of lights and noise, i will never know who i am.

Is there a solution for this? >fan based pages 

These pages are created by PR TEAM.
once you become a personality you have to create a paid fan base. this concept is also popular in political parties!

hopefully people will wake up to this truth :) This phenomena is called Splitting \([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting\_\(psychology\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology))\) and certain personality types are very vulnerable to it. Its also the reason why many people remain in toxic relationships despite the fact that everyone can clearly see their partner is bad for them because they idolize their partners in the same way.  This has been the case ever since civilization began...  For 1000s of years. Edit : grammar Actually its heavily tamed down from the times of Rajesh Khanna and all. You should check out the bile SRK and bhai fans exchange on twitter. Utterly cringe-inducing. Idolise the values, not the people. Respect the people, embrace the fact that everyone has flaws. It's the same with sports teams/religion/political parties etc. they're all very 'group' things. You can let yourself be very attached to them, it becomes part of your identity and sort of controls you. Pretty powerful tool to change behaviour. Unemployment and lack of critical thinking I'd largely part of this. 

That along with India's population, it is easy for mob mentality to kick in.

Prasar Bharati is a **statutory autonomous** body set up by an Act of Parliament and comprises the Doordarshan Television Network and All India Radio, which were earlier media units of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

Doordarshan (DD) is an **autonomous** public service broadcaster founded by the Government of India, owned by the Broadcasting Ministry of India and one of Prasar Bharati's two divisions.

The Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry, under Ms. Smriti Irani, had tried intervening in the functioning of the Prasar Bharati by withholding funds and assigning a bureaucrat to the Board. The board had [protested this citing their autonomous status](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prasar-bharati-rejects-ministrys-directives/article22765564.ece). It also said certain directives would benefit private broadcasters. 


>The Ministry also wants general entertainment channels to be replaced by channels run by Union Ministries. 

>The Prasar Bharati Board, however, has contended that it would make the bouquet uninteresting. The viewership of Doordarshan would “crash and Tata Sky and Zee Entertainment Dish TV will go laughing all the way to the Bank,” the documents stated.

The Ministry [denied intervening](https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ministry-denies-vendetta-against-prasar-bharati/article22914082.ece).

The Chairman of Prasar Bharati had said in an interview, ""[No other Act is treated with as much contempt](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-other-act-is-treated-with-as-much-contempt/article22920322.ece)""

Sports,Bala movie: A mix of new and the old (Analysis),16,du8jny,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/du8jny/bala_movie_a_mix_of_new_and_the_old_analysis/,4,"I was expecting nothing from the movie Bala because of majorly 2 things. First, I had checked twitter and found people with negative reviews (well Twitter is negative about everything these days) and secondly I had to walk out of the movie ""Dreamgirl"". I like Ayushmann but I found ""Dreamgirl"" pretty average and the movie felt like a culmination of comedy circus scenes. Thus, I was sceptical.

I was totally wrong. Bala is an Ayushmann khurana trademark movie. Ofcourse the director Amar Kaushik and the entire cast are responsible for the success. But, this movie is not merely about a good script selection. Ayushmann did a marvelous job of a frustrated insecured bald guy. I could relate to his frustration. The portrayal is just too realistic. 

Now, directly coming to the themes the movie touches. (Contains Spoilers)

1. Insecurities - The movie uses Baldness (primarily) and dark complexion as insecurities people have and how the world is hell-bent on shaming them. It sees Baldness and skin tone in a completely different way. Baldness touching the masculine charm and skin colour determining the feminine side. It explores these two ideas. 

Another insecurity it explores is the millennials quest for an enhanced pseudo identity on social media platforms. Bala gets upset about his baldness because he thinks he is not presentable on Instagram and Tiktok. The material socialisation of social media where we long to get likes in our videos, intellectual brainstorming statuses and etc. Yami Gautam's character comes in the frame here as she is a viral star with modeling aspirations.

2. Status quo - Javed Jaffrey remarks in the movie, that looks don't matter for men as it is a patriarchal society and after marriage the girl has to stay with the husband irrespective of her choice cause she is now tied. In the marriage it constantly challenges this notion. Bhumi Pednekar who is herself a lawyer, encourages a women to leave ger husband who was justifying her husband's cheating because of her weight. Yami Gautam files a divorce suit after she finds Bala is bald and has lied to her about his hair. It tries to break away from the marital trap of a women. 

3. Religion - Bollywood has attempted to touch religion in films like PK, OMG! Bala's addressing of religion is inclusive. Initially it criticises Lord Krishna for beautifing a dark toned into a fair skinned girl. In the end it analyses the situation in a completely different way. Krishna was not trying to change her into fair skin, the Lord was trying to make her realise that she is beautiful. This positive interpretation and understanding of India's religious practices is commendable because many a times we associate reformation with total denunciation of religion. India's secularism has always been about plurality and not about separation of church (here religion) from the state.

4. Pop culture

It touches upon the pop culture that shames dark skinned women by mocking certain Bollywood songs. It doesn't resort to any blame game because during that time subtle misogyny was evident everywhere rather it tries to remind us how subconsciously how we have been indoctrinated with the thought that beauty means fair.

5. Staying true to yourself

Both the women lead are true to their archetype. Bhumi although felt upset as a kid when she was shamed for being dark, she doesn't let it affect her way of life. She finds social media irrelevant to project a different self and tries to live her life with her ideals. Yami on the other hand is a product of social media. She is aware of her ""beauty"" appeal and uses that to build a brand around tiktok (just like a modern day influencer). She herself admits that ""externalities"" is her way of life and without that she is nothing. That bedroom scene with Ayushmann was much needed because there's a nerd culture being developed which shames people too much. ( So, what if someone uploads a selfie or a Tiktok video? Can we just mind our won business if we don't like it. If one is self aware of their potential and knows the market, exploiting it through social media is not a sin.) It is still better than the hypocrite Ayushmann who tries to fake it. Yami is not faking it. She is aware of her ""externality"" aspect. 

6. Activism: The best cinematic aspect of Bala is that the movie is not preachy. It is subtle in its activism. It doesn't call any names to direct blame, it highlights the normalisation of practices. Like fairness obsession, body shaming and even new ones like social media's edited reality. It depicts the shallowness of being too filmy. Bala's need for gratification comes from the fact he wants to emulate Bollywood behaviour. 

7. High school nostalgia: Bala tried so hard to have his hair back is because of the appreciation he received in school. A lot of people are stuck in their school days because they had a particular identity in school. Some were good at sports but later ended up in a deadbeat job and in the case of Bala, it being the popular kid in class. People are obsessed with the highschool nostalgia as they want to go back to those days to escape the monotony that employment and real life offers.

The most important point: Is Bala a traditional Bollywood hero? Well, Bala has certain flaws. He is bald which the B'town hero rarely is. He is insecured. Our heroes maybe big time fraud in their films but they are never insecured. Bala is different to a Bollywood hero. Bala doesn't get the girl. He gets rejected by Bhumi as she is in love with someone else. Also, it doesn't follow the Bollywood style of falling in love with the second girl (read rebound) in movies such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hain. Yammi ends up divorcing Bala.

But, but it follows the conventional hero arc in the end. Because the movie is all about Bala's victory over his insecurities. It is about his catharcis which he has in his last ""fairness"" cream presentation. It is about his reversal of fortune from being an average comedian to a well loved one. He follows the athenian ideal hero in a way. (Except he doesn't visit the underground) Bhumi feels sympathetic towards Bala and fights his case (it initially felt like she loves him but benefit of doubt she was fighting for herself as well as she might relate to Bala's baldness in a way as she has suffered societical taunting for her skin tonned)

Bala might have deviated from mainstream Bollywood norms (althout it is itself a commercial movie) but it adheres to the policy of The Indian Hero resurgence.

To conclude, all this analysis holds no value if the movie is boring and Bala is far from that. It is a fun watch.",nibirdeka, Any spoiler free tl;dr? ;),2019-11-10 15:35:54
Sports,Unpopular opinion : Virat Kohli is an overrated personality,98,bgxi3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bgxi3v/unpopular_opinion_virat_kohli_is_an_overrated/,69,"Not a great Cricket fan but I watch major tournaments. I have noticed many times that Virat is a famous yet hot-headed sportsperson. He has a big fan following, so he must play it cool and try not to make an angry face or super celebrating even something small. Dhoni is cool. He plays it cool. 
Idk why but I just don't like Virat for his this behaviour. I also don't know the truth about what he screams or cries in an ongoing match but it seems more like some abusive word or an insult for opposing team players. He is a great sportsman but he should realise the fact that he is role model for young and aspiring players.",koibhinhi," I don't think anyone rates him for his  personality, He is a brilliant cricketer with the typical mainstream Punjabi/Delhi attitude.  If it was not for his cricketing talent and hardwork, he would've been another Sreensanth. When did this become Unpopular? It’s a free country. He is as free to be himself as you are to dislike him. Why devote so much time to thinking about people who have no influence on your life whatsoever? I have gone from being a hater to absolutely adoring him (no homo). 

He earned all the respect through unbelievable consistency, performing everywhere in the world and conquering all challenges posed to him. Kohli is probably not as gifted as Sachin BUT he more than makes up for that through elite level of fitness that allows him to run doubles after scoring a hundred at same speed when he came on the crease. 

He plays cricket for India and is bloody good at it, that's all that matters. If you want to hear his side of the story then watch Nat Geo Masterclass episode on him.

Edit: No doubt he's bit of an asshole. He's a sports person and every sports person has their own style. You can see that in different sports as well. See Ronaldo, Djokovic they have so much anger on the field because that helps them. So what's wrong? 
He's not the most talented cricketer like Rohit Sharma, but he's the best cricketer in the world right now due to his hard work and  determination and dedication to fitness.
( I met Virat once off the field, he's a really kind person and gentleman. ) I don't care about his personality. He's a great player. Rohit sharma is a gifted and telented batsman.However , Virat kohli is Hardworking batsman and if history has proven one thing that is hardwork beats talents. If you see earlier records(under nineteenth even couple of years after) compare Rohit sharma and virat kohli you will find that sharma was little ahead and cricket came naturally to him.However Virat kohli is diciplined ,hardworker and he did not had butter chicken in last 4 years(heard in an interview) compare love handles of rohit sharma.Nothing against rohit sharma, Scoring 264 in an international is nothing sort of a miracle. But virat kohli is different he has picked his sacrifices ,He is impatience but compensate with perseverance. He is constantly trying improve not only his game but also in other life aspects.Whenever he is on Buses he make sure that he reads self improvement book.I am not fan of virat kohli but i am fan of his dicipline and regime. Aggression is absolutely necessary in competitive sports. Cricket in particular. 

Some manifest that aggression through shrewd tactics, some do it in body language, and some really talented ones do both. Whats up with everyone hating his aggression on the field?

Just because Dhoni was cool, not everyone can be like him

If you are expecting everyone to be nice to everyone then you must living in an another dimension I don't understand the folks here. First you guys cry about the 'Log Kya kahenge' attitude of parents. And when someone doesn't give a damn about it, you turn back and say ' Hooo, you're a role-model, act like it'. Why TF should he care what people & kids think about him? Sexy cricketer though, his batting is poetry in motion. Doesn't hurt that the helmet means I don't have to look at his face. He has matured after marriage. Might be a bit cocky, but sportsmen ka chalta hai. https://youtu.be/Gc_spTXnXRs Watch this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc\_spTXnXRs&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc_spTXnXRs&feature=youtu.be)

What Rahul Dravid is saying about him

>Staying authentic  
>  
>People ask me why I didn’t behave like Virat when I played for India. I would have been inauthentic to myself had I gotten tattoos and behaved like Virat.  
>  
>Sometimes, before an Australia series, Virat says the most outrageous things. I read it in the newspaper and cringe. But then, I feel that he wants that tough contest, and wants that lip on the field, because it gets the best out of him.  
>  
>You can’t blame him, because it works so very well for him. But that may not be everyone’s cup of tea. Ajinkya Rahane, for example, is very different.  
>  
>What worries me is that a lot of young kids tend to copy Virat, without realising that they are not being authentic to who they really are. Guys, there is a term called sportsmanship. It means playing competitively and yet respecting the game and the opponent players. You just cant go bad mouthing and showing frustation every time you get a chance. Thatbis just bad faith. First Kohli seemed to do this coz of his immense passion, these days it seems like he just fcuking hates his opponents. No matter how good you are, when you play at the level he is, you habe the resposibility of maintaining a decorum. See tennis for reference. I'm glad others in this world who care about cricket see Kohli's abuse-filled aggression as a passion for the game. No doubt he's one of the best in the world out there, but if the same abuse that he spews on-field if done on the street he could face criminal charges for abusive behaviour. Sadly commentators misinterpret as the passion so does the media, and budding cricketers and youth use the same in their field of work too. [deleted] Slightly late to the party but anywho - 

VK is definitely not overrated. Over the years, he has changed from a brash, immature gaali-spewing young boy to a calmer, more mature man. This was evident by the way he has carried himself in the public eye, most remarkably when he defended his then-girlfriend (and now wife) Anushka Sharma when she was getting trolled by his supporters. It is important to note that he started his career at an early age and since then, he has been under scrutiny. All of us were dumb as teenagers, just that our antics were not scrutinized by the media. 

If anything, Virat Kohli should be a role model for all young boys. He lost his father when he was barely in his teens, went to play a match while grieving his death, led his team to victory, made the team, became the best damn player that India has seen in a long time and is now leading the team to victory in the CWC. That too, without any connections or influence - purely on the basis of his talent and hard work. He also seems to be popular with his team and has their respect and support. He is a supportive husband who is not afraid to show his love for his wife and to stand up for her. His aggression is a part of his game and it is what makes him, him. I don’t think that’s a valid reason to hate on him, given that the aggression has never transformed into anger issues giving way to physical violence. 

He is a shining example of how your talent and hard work can take you to dizzying heights. As far as pure skill and temperament goes he is in his own league. He is better than sachin. I don't think He's overrated.  He deserves to run his mouth and act like douche all he wants if he can back it up. You don't have to love his personality, just his cricket. 

Makes it all the more fun and satisfying to watch him be cocky and then get outplayed and humbled by the other team every once in a while. I loved old virat... exactly for his hot headed behavior.

In this country woth all our bullshit like repect elder, respect the tradition, act mature bla bla bla he was such a nice change..

He used to have ""fuck you i have skills back up my attitude"" mentality which was so fucking inspirational. India needed young energy like him which showed that skill and hard work are the most important not sucking to people above you.

Now he has matured though which is also good.

In a healthy society hard working successful people should be  celebrated and respected..virat is beast when it comes to hardwork He is a great player which is what matters I'm a big big Kohli fan. 

He's a run machine. Probably the best white ball batsman ever. Never ever seen someone so consistent as him. The only thing that keeps him going is his ferocious intensity. On field he might be a nightmare for opposition, but off the field, he does come across as a very cool guy. Have seen almost all of his interviews and found none where he acted as a dick. 

Everyone has their own strengths that gets the best of out them. Dhoni's calmness maybe, but for Virat, it's his agression and intensity. 

As Harsha Bhogle said it, you take intensity out of Kohli, there's no Kohli left. 

Btw, Dhoni isn't cool/calm. Raina had pointed it out during one interview that Dhoni frequently gives a stick (which is not wrong). Abused Manish on camera ( again, nothing wrong) and latest where he came on field to confront the umpire for the no-ball call. I realized it a long time ago, before he was crowned a legendary status. You woke up pretty late. I have never seen a biggest snob in the sports before Kohli. Overrated? No motherfucker he's not. You'll understand when you start watching cricket. I don't know why Indian fans are so obsessed with behaviour. A cousin who lives in Australia told me how many fans he has there. FFS, understand the sport. You'll know he's already a legend. And he's better than Dhoni. Idk why Dhoni has more fans than Sachin and Dravid. Dhoni can't perform outside India. He's overrated. Yeah, I know this comment will be downvoted to oblivion. No shit. People are generally pretty obnoxious when it comes to Hero worship, and the cricket fans take it to the next level. I support this opinion. He is absolutely loved by media
 No questions are asked about his captaincy, decisions,...etc. just let off.. >he is role model for young and aspiring players.

Gulmarg, Auli, Solang all have no snow for half an year. Snow machines would be required after the season.  Hill top snow doesn't matter. No nation from the tropics has ever won a medal at the winter Olympics. Strange but true. TBH most of these games are expensive to get into considering the gear, the equipment, coaching cost, etc. India hasn't had much of a sporting tradition besides kabaddi, cricket and wrestling. The average Joe/Jane in India doesn't have any spare money lying around to get into other expensive sports.
As for the sporting federations and government support, you would be well aware that we cannot match the budgets and expenditures of the rich nations. There are just too many wannabes and everyone cannot be provided with assistance. Not to mention the corruption in these organisations...
So if you have the means and the interest please go ahead, but don't complain that we have 1.5 bn ppl and no medals or only 2 winter Olympic athletes blah blah blah... May be there aren't enough people interested in it.  Better than sending a huge contingent of politically connected athletes who drop out of the first round.  “They (*Indian Olympic Association*) actually asked me to get a certificate to prove that Winter Olympics is on par with Summer Olympics.”

- [Long read in NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/01/magazine/winter-olympics-luge-india.html) about Shiva Keshavan, who represented India five times at Winter Olympics. See OP, there is only one Olympics: The Summer Olympics. Winter Olympics is basically just rich white people sliding on ice. Gotta wait till winter cricket is introduced Winter Olympics is last rich white sports bastion. If you could do it without expensive gear, everyone would be on it. Is climbing Everest an olympic sport ? Why not ? Being the second most populous country in the world does not mean we have an obligation to shine in everything in this world. It's time we accept the fact that we're not gonna get good at sports that don't pay us well. We're not China where the government can keep people captive and train them from when they are 3 or 4, nor are we first world like the US where universities recruit people because they're good at a sport, and even if they fail to move upwards they can get a reasonably paying job, and the general attitude is to encourage people to take risks. We're a resource scarce country where THE ONLY way to become better is to get good grades and go to a good university where sports is not even a thing.  Poor argument as 90% of the people live away from areas which have snowfall. sorry but rest are making pakoras *Mere 2 tumhare 10 se kam hai ke?* Rest of them couldn't go because they didn't have Aadhar. [deleted] Most of the money doesn’t get to athletes. The ones that do get the money are usually kids of the people governing that body. 

Source: played a winter sport  at national level 

Edit: also by the time  the money reaches the governing body its significantly diluted  Lol I wouldn’t be surprised there India sent zero. 

Zero athletic gold medal at summer olympics so what do you expect.

Wait till someone invents ice cricket then maybe... Only if it snowed in Haryana. Sharma jee ka beta doesn't play. He studies 18 hrs a day. If you play,what will you eat in future. That's an illogical statement. Canada has 3.5cr people but tops the medal table because Canada is a snowy country.

Sports,My father ate cattle feed so I could train: Gomathi Marimuthu,391,bi00l2,http://www.espn.in/athletics/story/_/id/26616891/my-father-ate-cattle-feed-train-says-800m-gold-medallist-gomathi-marimuthu,30,,that_70_show_fan," Her dedication and her family's sacrifice have brought glory to our country. Bravo! She's a beacon of inspiration and hard work. 👏🏽 I hope she wins Olympic Gold next ... salute her dedication and courage Wow! came here thinking I'll read heartwarming comments. Instead find absolute crap. So many incredible stories we have, but hey nobody gives a shit.

Edit: Finally some good people chiming in! Her actual press conference is worth a watch if you can understand Tamil. She gives in to her tears when she starts talking about her dad!!  https://twitter.com/imranhindu/status/1122007019928444928 Stories like these make me appreciate little things in life that I take for granted. Why do the poor in this country have to go through so much to attain success man! Wow she is such an inspiration. She fought through all those struggles to make the country proud. Excellent work 😊👏🏽❤️

I didn’t understand the last paragraph of the article. From what I understood, she had to train away from the actual training camp ? Because of finances?

I was under the impression that govt would take care of training for athletes at least  at the Asian Games level.

Was it a govt failure or is there some other story ? Can someone with Tamil knowledge who watched the interview help us understand ? God bless his soul, such a great father and a human. At least his sacrifices were not in vain and he will always live on in her heart! The headlines only made me emotional let alone watching the whole press conference.

May god bless her. Such a shame, to see Sports Min only advt. & Running virtually on Twitter. Even if they work 5% many aspiring athletes would put India on top on medal tally. Her hard work & her father's sacrifices did it all.

We barely did anything much in her journey, yet we can all be proud of her ! I know it's a fad to hate on parents for trying to live vicariously through us but sometimes their sacrifices are incredible He passed away presumably from the sacrifice 😔 mill waste cannot be digested by humans any more than tree leaves Thanks to AIDMK and DMK for sponsoring the cattle feed and not giving any other resource for this many long years.

Sports,These boys in blue have had a fantastic few years too!,2564,adrcth,https://i.redd.it/u4ux5qpa55921.jpg,81,,ZombieGombie," Despite the lack of interest, compared to cricket,  their hindered funding, these men have showed an entire nation what passion for a sport can achieve. Proud of our blue army. yup hopefully in a decade we can be under 50 maybe. I wish to see India Participate in a World cup one day. I think this may have a lot to do with ISL. Which is fantastic, because that should be the purpose of such large format leagues.

ISL started the league in 2014 and this can't be just a random coincidence.

There were championships and leagues before as well, but they were just too marginal or small. It is sad that we need glitz and glam to grow sports, but hey, the good news is that it does work! Brilliant! Wish to see them in World Cup in my lifetime  Is the image copied from the TMNT template? Weird choice leaving the head bands in.  Yet they dont get the attention from media which they deserve  India plays their next game against UAE on 10th January. Do join us at /r/IndianFootball for match day festivities. Hope to see you all there! FIFA rankings are shit, but yeah India has undoubtedly improved! Thai game was the reassurance. It’s sad that they get so little from our nation. Still, sooooo proud of them 🎉 Nice  So proud to witness the rise of Indian Football ! Ordinary citizens won't like a game as long as they don't play it or connect with it themselves. Indians grow while playing cricket and hence develop a liking for the game over time. Football is mostly played in North-eastern parts and West Bengal, but it isn't as mainstream as cricket.

Now to make football a popular sport in the country we should promote the game in the grassroot level first rather than just creating ads which force people to be a fan of the game. Kinda miss Robin Singh on both football and cricket now  All we need is to stand with them as we did with our cricket team make them A STAR too like cricket players.

Only posting on Social media Is not Enough for them I think.

And sorry for the reaction but, they really need our support now

You can also contribute to the success you just did to give time to this sport that it,

that what they wanted from us 

&#x200B; Can someone tell me where can I buy a jersey outside of India? I watched the highlights of the match, one question: why is chhetri not wearing the captain's armband?  I'm so proud man, go blue tigers! I wish we'll see Indian Team in Fifa world cup soon I hope I will go to Germany someday..for photo
 All thanks to our great leader they continue to prove their mettle and the Indian govt. still doesn't support them I wish someday there is a spark of interest for motorsports too in India like football had sudden out burst of popularity Very Well Done..Keep Moving and Growing....

Sports,Indian mentality.,2,egc01b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/egc01b/indian_mentality/,0,"This is something that I wanted to get off my chest. India got its independence in 1947 but even now indirectly we are under the rule of westerners.

Let me start with education

Our curriculum is such that , innovation and creativity is killed, we are trained and educated in such a way that we can work under the huge MNC's operated by westerners. Individuality is killed and people are corrupted by the sheep mentality. Higher education is a big joke in this country, those who pursue masters and post docs are those who couldn't land a job(most cases). We still have the slave mindset within us , we want to work for someone, doesn't matter if you like the job but we will work to get paid.The syllabus was designed by the british and we are still following it.

Moving on, we have our economy,

India and Pakistan are the cheapest countries to live in this world, not africa,not venezuela but India. What this essentially means is that if you go to any other country with the same wealth you possess in India, you will become [poorer .](https://poorer.No)  No wonder Americans use Indians for cheap labour. Even after being the cheapest country to live in , we have so many living below poverty line which speaks a lot about wealth distribution in our country. All those who come up with stats regarding GDP, please lookup GDP per person because that's what essentially matters.

We call ourselves a secular country, but ram mandir dispute constantly made headlines. Let me be honest, I dont care about who wins regarding this, but was this really a priority, can't this wait until we have progressed in other important areas?, our healthcare is in such bad condition, the state of the BPL people are pathetic but they want to construct this temple now anyways? Im not asking them to build hospitals in the place instead of the temple, that's foolishness and makes no sense, why can't they spend on healthcare and education first and afterwards think about this temple.

The defense budget is 3.18 lakh crore ,great our army is powerful and is the second largest but what the government fails to realize is that the biggest war is happening inside India. We spend so much preparing for war with other countries that we fail to fight our internal problems. Why can't the budget for healthcare and education be increased by reducing the budget for defense. Now some might argue that countries like USA too spend large o defense but the difference is that they are already developed, they don't have much problems from within whereas we are still a third world country.

All those media hype surrounding how India is a rising superpower is complete bogus, they want us to believe we are making progress so that can make good use of our pathetic situation. The real rising superpower is china, just look at their technological advancements.  

Moving on, we have sports 

The most popular sport in India is cricket. Now let me remind you that cricket was introduced by the british to us and we still play the game widely while they have moved on other sports. cricket is the number one sport only in 2 countries , India and pakistan both which were ruled by british. We are indirectly still slaves, we play the same sport they gave us even after 100 years. 

Having a population of about 1.4billion, our representation in olympics wont even equal countries which have population less than 10 million. Thats how pathetic is the condition of sports in India.

People just dont care, dont watch and don't play other sports, we simply aren't told to do so and so we refrain from playing others, only if this mentality changes will we progress in other sports, we can't just blame the government for not funding, if people aren't watching how will they fund. 

Moving on, we have women safety

Women safety is a big joke in India, Indian culture teaches us to respect women but why is the situation so pathetic.

Clearly this is because of lack of education and lack of sex education.

We wrote kamasutra, but now talking about sex is taboo. Indian schools treat sex as a foreign topic and most schools just outright skips this topic. When you say sex is taboo, it increases the curiosity in the mind of people, people crave most what they don't get/understand and like adding oil to fire we have all bollywood movies objectifying women which corrupts the weak minded and thus they give in to their sexual feelings.  

Sex education is important to understand and control one's feelings. 

I created a Fake facebook id, with a woman's picture as the profile picture and I got 879 friend requests within a day, most of them being indians, and I got 100 pm's asking me for nude pics. This level of desperation will ultimately lead to them becoming rapists and [molesters. No](https://molesters.No)   wonder women dislike Indian men.

And finally I want to end with bollywood

Most of the actors are light skinned and have features similar to europeans.Almost half of the actresses are NRI who eith er lived in england or USA.

This clearly shows that we still subconsciously are being slaves, we consider light skinned more superior, we feel they deserve more respect and this mentality should be changed if we really want progress in our society.",deathandparadise,,2019-12-27 22:48:47

Sports,Why doesn’t India have more olympic medals or elite athletes,14,cfw1sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cfw1sb/why_doesnt_india_have_more_olympic_medals_or/,18,I’m just curious a question coming from an american paki whose never been back to his home country. Let’s just say for arguments sake Indians are not genetically athletic however in a sample size of 1.3 billion people you are going to have very large statistical outliers (I also don’t think Indians are not genetically inferior especially north Indians) but why haven’t they been found. China has 2 billion people and has made the most with them.They currently have track runners running 100m times in 9.8s which is enough to medal if not even win the next olympics even if Chinese are not “athletic” in a large sample size there will be elite athletes. So why haven’t they been found in India. China also wins the second most medals and have also produces players in basketball. I’m just curious why this is with the population size.,Bigguns26," Since you compare with China, I will paste my comment from an earlier thread

> Chinese government spends $46 billion on sports, while our budget allocation in sports is around $0.5 billion.

India needs massive infrastructure to train and support its athletes. Getting Olympic medals is a long term strategy, you can't just wake up one day and hope to win a medal. Just look at Mr. Bindra and the amount of time and money he invested to win his gold medal. We need world's top coaches to train our elite athletes, which needs $$$. Culture and history: Not many role models and viable career pathways hence low base  . The cliche of a billion people is just that a cliche without substance . Very few young people engage in sports, for starters need encourage kids to play but many schools don't have playgrounds .So parents are worried about kids future and discourage  them China does not have 2 billion people, its population size is close to India at 1.3-1.5 billion, some countries have more registered professional athletes of certain sports despite having much smaller population than China and India. 

It comes down to the sport culture of a country, I'm guessing there are fewer registered athletes in India than Netherlands even, also check out the availability of sport facilities in India compared to other countries, I think it is also pretty low. 

Indians are not genetically inferior but I think religion is a great factor when it comes to nutrition, there are so many food taboos around in India that are stopping ordinary Indians from having balanced diet. This topic was discussed just yesterday. [This](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/andrew.bernard/olymp60restat_finaljournalversion.pdf) famous paper found a strong association between Olympics medal tally and GDP, population size, ""host country effect"" and ""Olympics-oriented investment"" like in Soviet Union and China. China's advantage over India is its strong economy (5 times India's GDP) and an obsessive investment in sports. Apart from the many reasons listed already it's also about the cultural apathy towards any sport which we do not already dominate in. That apathy translates to exceptional athletes with medals practically begging for food after retirement. Govt does not provide enough after care to retired athletes and they are left to fend for themselves.

Would you want your child to sacrifice education for say a chance at volleyball if you know that most players have no future after the fact? Cause Indians don’t give a fuck about anything except cricket. Kyuki pesa lgta hai Like in real life democratic political system and govt has utterly failed to provide infrastructure for sports , promote it and provide facilities and support athletes . Its a combination of genetics, culture and GDP. In all these factors, India has the worst possible state.

1. Genetics: Indians on average are shorter and fatter than all races (maybe except East Asians). There is a study which shows that for the same BMI, Indians add on more fat than any other race. Needless to say, absorbing more fat for the same BMI is not a recipe for athleticism. 

2. Culture: The diet is horrible. Full of carbs (processed nowadays) and almost no protein. Nothing to do with income either, rich people also have the bad mix of macro nutrients. No culture of physical fitness. People think going to gym is only for bodybuilders.

3. GDP: $2000 per capita is 142 out of 200 countries. India is piss poor. Dont consider PPP here, top class sports equipment doesnt cost less in India. Small schools in the US have better facilities than elite sports clubs in India.

4. Olympics: Consider the types of competitions in Olympics. I would understand if there was 1 swimming event. Instead there are dozens of different combinations of swimming related events. This excludes most poor countries where swimming pools are a luxury. Equestrian events - need I explain?",2019-07-21 14:21:35

I hope the fielders don't get butterfingers now. iirc, A firm in NZ had discouraged the project of Amul's to derive milk powder from Buffalo's milk, saying that it was not possible (the NZ firm would be losing its business in India if that was achieved). Not only did Amul accomplish it.. it is now **the official sponsor of their country's cricket team!**

Well done Amul. Cricket in New Zealand needs to survive for the viewers in India [deleted] Amul dhoodh peeta h black chiriya. Quite interesting. Amul sponsoring the team of the biggest milk producer.   As of now sponsorship is only for the Champions Trophy, they did similar thing in 2011 Cricket World Cup by sponsoring he Netherlands Cricket Team. So is amul products available in New Zealand? Just don't use butter on balls Why is this even news? Amul also sponsored the Netherlands cricket team in the 2011 World Cup.

*edit: had written 2014 by mistake It's unfathomable that a country with 1.2 billion people doesn't have companies that compete in global stage. (Proportionally speaking it's non existent)

My mechanical professor misbehaved with a cute northie. Suspended.

Another mechanical professor (also hostel warden) tortured hostel students, he shit his pants when one student drank all-out mosquito repellant. He liked students who are scared easily and act like slaves. He had some kind of joy feeling powerful over these helpless kids who came to unknown city and stayed in that hostel.

My school math teacher was a hardcore christian, she gave special care to christian students. A non-christian student not scoring is dumb, but a christian student not scoring needed practice. 

Tuition teacher prefers talkative and jovial ones, he was a strict math teacher in KV but jovial and friendly guy in his tuition classes. He even teaches shortcuts and easy methods in tuition but not in school.

PT teacher was hell bent on sports and never let other teachers take PT period as substitute for their subjects. We all loved her. She liked the ones who got her medals in zonals.

My computer teacher liked the ones who are smart and answers questions first..Imagine students like Hermione from harry potter. 

Biology teacher was the best who genuinely worried about underperforming students. Never gave special attention to top students as they never needed it in first place


To answer your question, i think this is all subjective. i think it all comes down to have a student behaves with a teacher cuz even they are human and then comes all the other factors like academic performance etx [deleted] Kids who interact in class - not the ones who stare into the abyss like brain-dead zombies. Kids who question, challenge and provide alternative to what I teach. Kids who are cool and talk wittily - not the ""yes, sir"" kind of flattering dorks. I like if they are involved in extra-curricular activities, but it should not be at the cost of their primary goal - education.

P.S.: I am an Assistant Professor (Engineering) in a top government college. I teach online and one on one which makes for a very different experience than classroom teaching - the most inspiring ones are those who never give up. They may be less gifted, and scores may disappoint. But they tenaciously keep working and in the end their results have always surprised me.

Just last year one student who i taught over two years and despaired for his performance made it through to NIT Surathkal.

Another guy who I briefly taught in 10th, was pretty ordinary, but made up for that with insane amounts of work and got into IIT-B. There he stepped it up sleeping only 4 hours a day on occasion and won the Presidents Gold Medal. When he graduated, Stanford and MIT rolled out red carpets to welcome him to their campus.

I could go on, but these two really stood out. Not a full time teacher; help a few kids in my neighborhood with their studies. I try to get them to stay inquisitive, ask questions & accept it is alright to say ""I don't know"". School education discourages then from asking questions (especially if it falls outside their syllabus). [removed] Toppers Dead I like the ones who are curious about things.

Doesn't matter which subject music/sport/science/business/cooking/art whatever. They go and try to find the answers and come back with many questions. Watching that process, of them discovering things for the first time by their own effort is very inspiring and satisfying. IANAT but other half is. 

Recently she was most impressed by a student who was deported from another school after failing, came here, continued to do poorly upto preparatory exams but got things together, concentrated and worked hard and ended up in high sixties (%). Approaching the exams she used to say I will be most happy if this kid passes. And was ecstatic to see his scores finally. There were many kids in 90+ and 80+ range in the same batch.

>Screw you TRAI. ",_RandomRedditor," Hey I was paying less than 250 with most HD sports channels running on D2H, now I'm paying 300+ & no sports channels & other GEC channels cut in half!

Screw you TRAI^2 TRAI has always been a loser when it came to the public. They were not able to reduce the call drops. They totally screwed us during net neutrality until (due to immense public pressure) they decided to go with it. And now this. Its time TRAI is held accountable for its existence.  TRAI anticipates that channel prices will come down gradually.

But I'd say get a firestick , a decent broadband connection and subscription of those streaming apps. I switched and never lookd back to DTH.  I am an Indian who stays in bangalore who watches content from almost all the channels (kannada, tamil, telugu, hindi, english) and I have to pay almost around 800 ish if I want to have the same experience. So fuck me right TRAI. Real dick move by TRAI This pricing scheme is helpful only for people who watched very few channels to begin with. TRAI had put a cap on discount that operators could provide in bouquets. 15% max discount on bouquet than a-la-carte. That would have gotten the price of individual channels down. All operators went to Madras High Court against this rule where HC ruled against TRAI. With much lower prices for bouquets than a-la-carte, operators are basically forcing you to take their bouquets instead of going alacarte way. [As of now, TRAI has withdrawn 15% discount cap petition from Supreme Court] Same here.

My yearly subscription will end soon. I have already subscribed to Sony Liv and Zee5. Will subscribe to Hotstar soon and too voot when they will have live channel available (they don't have subscription model as of today). It will cost me around INR 3000  per year. I have got 150gb broadband connection which is never utilized. So I'll be getting all the channels for 250 per month and since I have multiple TV, the average will be much less. I thank TRAI for screwing up this well. I think I was way too comfortable with what I had. They made me rethink the entire cabel cost optimization. Removed sony channels. Got Sony liv yearly subscription.   I used to pay 280 for all the channels, now I have to pay 600 for the channels which me and my parents watch. Go to hell TRAI.  Mine went from 280 to 200 [deleted] I used to pay 600ish monthly. Now it's half that. Thank you TRAI, I guess? Cost reduced for them who only watched Republic TV.. Mine went down from 300 to 275.

I watch only SD and don't have any hindi GECs. I think those channels are really expensive and pack costs have gone up for those watching hindi GECs.. for rest there is definitely a decline.

Also those who watch a limited number of channels have benefited while those who watch a large set have been fucked. TRAI are absolute dickheads.. We should also blame the government for letting this happen.  Tbh the problem isn't with TRAI , it's the nature of DTH and cable market which is against any good reform in the sector. By bumping up each channel rates to such an high price they say either toe the bouquet way or opt the alacarte model at your peril. 

I hope in coming days they reform the cost of Channels to the optimum cost. I'm on the other side of the coin. 

My monthly cost came down because I barely watch TV. I just picked the packs for channels my mom watches and I was done. I just add the sports channels on the days when there are matches I want to watch and remove them the next day.

 That's it. Ridiculous.  ""Your costs will be lower when you stop watching TV"" -- xoxo, TRAI I was paying 550 + 250 for a long duration pack. Now paying 300 + 250 (multi TV) Earlier you were probably being subsidised by those users watching fewer channels paying more than what they actually needed. Time to pay your fair share.

Looking at the pricing on TRAI [website](https://channel.trai.gov.in/), most of the channels cost ₹7 or less. Of those you mentioned, Sony, Sony sports channels and Colors cost ₹19 (and even these are available in bouquets to lower costs). I don't see how you can be mad at TRAI when they're instituting a per channel pricing and making it transparent. I don't understand how can anyone enjoy all the stupid bullshit they show on Indian tv. In recent years Indian influences have destroyed the only good channels worth watching like CN, NICK, DISCOVERY, NAT GEO, HISTORY etc.. Anyone intelligent in their right mind would cut the cable and use internet to watch anything entertaining. I had to keep the connection just for my parents and they too don't watch serials and all the vomit inducing reality shows. So this new system is pretty great for me. I just chose very few channels that we actually flip through. only 300 rs. 
 Try getting packs...I only watch sports (football) and I got a pack that was cheaper than selecting one by one, use the trai website to see cheapest plan I think those who watch more channels should be given some discount . I pay  250 for cable, and have almost channels.
Except some sports channels. Because they are expensive.
Now we will have to pay shit loads. Same here. I used to pay 400 for all HD and SD channels. Now I am getting only sony sports pack and star value pack.
I am actually shocked.
I am just waiting for Giga fiber and giga tv.  Exactly!

Had to forego the HD channels in order to get my prices lower than the previous package which had HD + SD. I have 4 tata sky connections. 1 primary and 3 multi tv(you have to pay full cost for primary and 250 each for multi tv). Out of the 4 TVs, 2 are HD supporting and other 2 are old school CRT. 

I was paying 750 for my primary and another 250+250+250 for my other connections. I had all HD & SD channels tata sky offers on its platform.

Now if I subscribe to a HD channel, I don't get its corresponding SD channel with it. So i can't watch HD channels now.

FUCK YOU TRAI I think these new DTH rules will benefit us in the long run.

As people start subscribing lesser number of channels, expect broadcasters to reduce their prices. Channels will lose a great deal of advertising revenue if they continue to price their channels so high.

My opinion - Wait and watch for a couple of months. Things will become clear.  Some people here and in other similar threads claim that hotstar and Sonyliv is a viable alternative. It's simply not for sports. I've a decent net plan (around 50mbps) and yet, when India plays, the quality is pathetic (Looks like 144p even when you select full HD) . It's alright while watching on your phone but you simply can't watch it on your TV.  Ftom 250 earlier to a steep 610 this month.

Fuck you TRAI and your ""Revolutionary"" step.  Iptv is your friend There are bouquet(bundled channels from company) eg-Times now hd bouquet at 15rs includes mn+,movies now,mnx,romedy now etc.
Choose the channels wisely ,for me it has reduced from 400 to 230rs. from my understanding, this whole exercise was to make dth expensive and complicated for the normal household. so that when jiofiber comes with all inclusive plan, customers would flock to it. and dth companies would disappear the same way most of the telecom companies have disappeared. in the end, only tata sky might survive along with airtel.  Do people actually still watch TV? Mine went from 420 a month to 320 I think Go for a google certified android box or you are in luck if you have android tv :) prefer online apps maybe one day they will come up with providing the option of the individual channel pay on IPTV :) Wait for JIO cable to come, it will be cheap then. Hey, let's not blame TRAI. They are really laying foundation for the future by forcing people to cut cabke/dth and move to online services. What an idea.

Sports,Lifecycle of Indian Male,56,ce06hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce06hm/lifecycle_of_indian_male/,58,"Day 1 – You are born. Parents are celebrating that you are male and even more happier if you have fair skin.

&#x200B;

Childhood – You are expected to go with the flow. You begin to learn the ins and outs of Indian society. Everything can be bargained for in the market and wild animals are everywhere. Creativity, loners, and independent thinking are frowned upon. If you get bullied, **IT’S YOUR FAULT FOR BEING DIFFERENT**. Anything bad that happens (poor eyesight, too short, too fat, etc.) is also **YOUR FAULT**.

&#x200B;

More Childhood – Your parents educate you on your background/culture and how it is the best in the world. In public, your family act friendly with everyone but in private they may make comments ranging from politically incorrect jokes to straight up racist statements. But it’s okay **BECAUSE YOU’RE SPECIFIC CULTURE IS THE BEST**.

&#x200B;

Teenage – The only thing that matters are grades at this point. Sports? Not for you. Music? Weak hobby. Art? That’s for transgenders. Comparisons begin with sharma ji’s beta. Pretty soon, you realize school is not about learning but regurgitating information in a short amount of time. Many people get good grades but few have any curiosity and even fewer learn good civic sense. Teachers are abusive but it’s **YOUR FAULT** because **ELDERS CAN NEVER BE WRONG**.

&#x200B;

More Teenage – You somehow get into college. Only options are medicine or engineering, otherwise you are out of the family because no one will marry you. You also realize that your parents don’t really love each other and try to emotionally blackmail you because you are the only reason they are together. Girls are to be avoided because they only want sex and are a distraction. Everyone (friends, families, distant relatives, neighbors) is in your business because **NOTHING IS PRIVATE**. You are responsible for family honor.

&#x200B;

Studenthood – You go to college. You meet many indoctrinated kids but join the crowd because who are you. You (or at least me) grew up with few female interactions and fail miserably at getting a girlfriend because you are too shy. By the time you get your act together, you are 22. At least you made some good mates.

&#x200B;

Adulthood – You become an Engineer or Doctor **BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES IT**. You probably get a job. A high paying job. It doesn’t matter how much you work, what you do, or if you enjoy it because only **MONEY MATTERS**. If you don’t get a job, it is your fault because you weren’t competitive in the rat race.

&#x200B;

Now you are expected to marry a women significantly younger than you, from a (very) similar background, is fair, very educated but also a housewife. **TROPHY WIFE**. You will be expected to live with your parents who will control your adult life just like their parents did to them. Your new goal is to get to America/Canada/UK **BECAUSE INDIANS BRING THE BEST CULTURE**. Even if you don’t make it, anyone who you know does is automatically a good friend that lives abroad.

&#x200B;

Regardless of where you are in life, you might get a son and the process repeats.",Minuteman60," >Girls are to be avoided because they only want sex and are a distraction.

Damn. I must have missed that one. TL;DR : Indian males gaand marao as usual. [deleted] ???? Did I enter Quora by mistake? Pretty sure I saw this copypasta on Quora sometime ....IS REDDIT TURNING INTO QUORA??? In short.. be like Sharmaji ka beta. Umm yaha sabki fati hui kyu hoti hai. Aren't you guys capable of changing your own lives. >Lifecycle of Indian Male

Iff you are born in to a well off / middle class family.


I agree with most of the things you said. We should learn from ourselves and provide a better life to the next generation. What about the stage when Indian men are incels till they get someone to marry them. Art is for transgender’s??????????????? That’s a big F for you brother...........stay strong Sabhi depressed ho kya yahaan par? Your entire post is full of cringe. As per your post, Life of an Indian Male is full of misery. Obviously our life is not as good as an average Male in the US for example. But its far better than an average Male in Africa, Pakistan, North Korea etc.


Edit: Let me add some more points.

An average US Male in his 20's is pressurized by the society to leave his parents and look for a job and live on his own. This could be incredibly stressful. 
In India, parents will support you and you can happily live in your parent's house without the society shaming you and save on rent. If you don't want to live with parents, you are free to do so in many cases.Parents will still send you money and give emotional support.
Reality is that there are challenges in every society, not just in India. So stop blaming the society and work on solving your problems. You missed, *now give us a male child* part. I would consider rephrasing the title from ""Indian male"" to ""Upper-Caste Hindu male""

Paleness and purdah aren't generally in vogue for say, the Adivasi segment of your nation. Don't have a son and break the cycle.",2019-07-17 01:30:30

I went through a rabbit hole of random Youtube videos of all these people. More power to them :)",newchurner255," 2> No.. because emulator matches you against other emulator players. A mobile player can have emulator players in  the same match when someone in his *pre selected* team is an emulator player, never through auto matching  r/indiangaming I think Mortal won some tournament. He was in top 5 in asia in one season.  

I can’t say if pubg or fortnite os more popular but the college junta is more inclined tp pubg and the younger junta is more towards fortnite.  1. PUBG  mobile > pubg emulator > fortnite > pubg pc.
2. It's not unfair as people playing on emulator will be matched against emulator players only.
3.These players are not professional players, they are just streamers who push their rank to reach at the top of the leaderboard.

It’s common sense. Of course PV Sindhi going into Olympics finals filled out the schedules of all badminton coaches in India. 

That said, there are practical constraints why sports like football and hockey aren’t thriving in India. They both need some decent size land which is barely there in many places. You can play cricket on a deserted road in the middle of the day in countryside. It’s hard to do so with hockey or football. I feel there's a bit of a chicken and egg scenario here, with teams lacking support due to not bringing in huge results and the lack of support translating to lack of funds and training required to bring in huge results.  Calling something 'Unpopular opinion' doesn't make it an insightful thought. What you stated is common sense.  No shit sherlock ",2018-12-20 05:28:25

**BJP is not anti-Muslim since Modi sports beard, says Mohsin Raza**

LUCKNOW:

Mohsin Raza

, the only Muslim minister in the BJP government, on Tuesday said that the BJP
was not an anti-Muslim party since Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

sports a beard which is generally considered an Islamic symbol.

Raza, who is a junior minister for haj and

waqf

, was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the inauguration of the haj
training and vaccination camp at the Ali Miyan Memorial Haj House in Lucknow
on Tuesday.

""An environment has been created by people where BJP is considered an anti-
Muslim party. It is not true. Had BJP been an anti-Muslim party, PM Modi would
have not had a beard. A beard is generally considered to be a pious Islamic
and Muslim symbol,"" Raza said.

He quoting a dialogue from a Bollywood film: ""Islam mein dhaadi hai, dhaadi
mein Islam nahi"" (There is provision for a beard in Islam, but a beard does
not mean Islam.""

Raza also said it is high time that the word 'minorities' be put out of use as
they total around 20 crore in population.

He said it is a different debate whether there should be a minority status or
not, but that in his opinion, the word itself should be out of use.

Now don't say; ""kids are happy with what they get"" How do you calculate TRP? Why can't I just subscribe to just a few channels A la  carte style? I hate the package system. I just watch sports on TV and for a full sports package I need to have the basic package subscribed as well. I have shifted to just streaming online now.  I don't know if this question is relevant to a manager...

Nor do I know if you have Indian channels in your scope but anyway. Are Indian GE channels using inadequate video bandwidth for HD(1080)? I can see visible artifacts in most of them compared to say American channels. I don't know the industry terms but as someone who messes around with video encoding, it looks like inadequate bitrate artifacts. Why is that Star came up with only HD channels for EPL? Not that I am complaining personally, but wont it have impact on their reach as not many would have such televisions and the money to subscribe them.  are there any rules regarding content to advertisement ratio? Not a question really, but OP you seem like a chill dude. Stay happy man What's the status of 4k in India? 

 If I have a small production house and I want to make a pilot episode of a cartoon series for kids, to whom can I pitch this to? 

Say the series is good and I want to land a deal/contract with any minor or major player, I realize this is very difficult but what would the process of doing it would be? Do you think that the internet would replace television in the next 5 years or so? At least in the metros?

Also, would you say that regional channels are a lot better in producing quality content than Hindi GECs? Why isn't there some kind of prime membership if someone doesn't want to watch ads?  There are some news channels that are likely to have very small audience . Are they running profitably or are some just arms of political propoganda.
Also, why can't cable TV give options to users to delete some free channels  How much do the infomercial programs (Telebrands et al) pay for their hour-long programs?  Why do Indian TV channels have massive and opaque logos that take up a huge chunk of the corner?

Most channels in the US have  transparent logos that don't block content. I have seen that some groups like Sony have 2-3 channels( SONY MAX HD, SONY MAX HD + 1) showing the same content at the same time. How is this profitable to them? How much does it cost  them to set up a channel? Also what is the process to set up a channel? Hi, thanks for doing this. 

Question: What's up with Star Sports ka Select HD? They've scheduled F1, The PL, Bundesliga on the same channels! I don't follow the PL, but F1 race weekends pey we miss out on some stuff! 

On the other hand, Sony is doing a good job with the Liga. I like how they're scheduling stuff.  Why do Indian news channels still broadcast at 4:3 ratio that looks stretched on a widescreen TV? Other channels like RT, Al Jazeera, even Rajya Sabha are at 16:9 (they look squashed on a 4:3 TV though).

Are 16:9 displays not common enough yet? How much do you think has Internet (NetFlix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar, etc included) affected the cable/ digital TV industry? According to you, has there been a decline in TV viewership in the last few years (in India)? I have noticed it 100% of time that all major news channel runs ad at the same time. Do they sync their ad slot or its just a sick coincidence? When do you think UHD channels will be introduced in India?

Edit: Can you pitch a dedicated anime tv channel to your seniors?  What happened to HBO Hits and Defined? I am guessing it didn't find too many takers at 100 rupee pm for 2 channels? Why are ad-breaks on hindi movie channels so much longer compared to English movie channels? You can sit through Ad breaks on english movie channels, watch the ads & then resume watching movies. But it just isnt possible to sit though a movie break on hindi movie channels. They are too long; causing people to change channels to watch something else. So they don't actually help anyone. taking a break. Will resume at night if there are further queries.  Has Selected HD affected star sports ratings? Does a lot of analytics go into which advertisements to braodcast and when? What should be the ideal duration, target segments etc. If yes what are some companies that do that? why are there no more fapworthy programmes on any channels? is the censorship that strict?

edit: otoh if you know of any please do let us know do you think your job will die in next 5 years because of growing internet traffic?
 Not a rant, but apart from real-time sports content, I don't find a need to watch cable TV anymore. All the good contents are available on Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar (which even streams live cricket & EPL) & the mighty Youtube. What's your say on this? Will Internet video streaming take over cable TV in India? Why doesn't anyone provide 60fps HD?   a) How different are the four main players in GEC market - Star, Zee, MSM, TV18?

b) How involved is 21st Century Fox in functioning of Star?

c) Which Entertainment firm in India is getting digital right? How big of a threat to traditional TV channels are international services like Netflix and Amazon Prime? Not sure if the question is relevant, but how can I legally buy/acquire a copy of discontinued TV shows which cannot be found on the internet or shops? How easy is it to manipulate TRP ratings? Are there any headwinds (using some of the jargon managers use) to tackle the Internet based entertainment industry.  How much do ad costs vary across the networks? And also throughout the day?  [deleted] Why is the content different on SD and HD versions of the same channel?  Not sure if this is related to your profession - Why do I have to suffer the pathetic ad channel when the settop box comes on ? Why cannot the box have some cache facility to show the programme information ?

 How does one become a manager at a major broadcast company?  what did you study in college? Asking since I'd also like to get into the same field. Can you elaborate a bit on the ad pricing, general business model and average price to the paying company for a random ad. (Coming from a guy who knows absolutely nothing..) Why doesn't India have content ratings for TV programs? - does krishna abhishek's shit really have higher TRPs than kapil's show? (both are shit imo)

- what do you think of amazon prime's market strategy w.r.t. other online players and amid reports that it is hemorrhaging money? Sir, how can I watch the full BARC ratings of shows on their site?

Tata Sky has a SD offering that broadcasts Madrasi movies dubbed into Hindi in all prime time slots. The native Hindi movies are only available on HD. I don't want to watch Indra the Tiger for the 3rd time this week.

Why you do this?? why has M Tunes HD been unavailable on DishTV for last week? 

Screen says ""We will be back soon "" and has a M tunes logo. But what can possibly take a week?  Also, what's with the stupid masala southern movies being shown on hindi movies all the time ? Why not show movies from other languages too which may actually have better content ? How are you going to compete with Chromecast ? (Isn't TV dead ?) Hey man. How you doing.",2017-02-15 14:18:37
Sports,People would have laughed if someone in 90s had predicted that one day Indian cricket will produce a trio of pacers breaking all time record of the legends like Holding/Marshall/Garner! Tomorrow might be that day :-),844,aaaozr,https://i.redd.it/5njv25kp21721.jpg,87,,nolanfan2," This was posted before start of Day 3's play, after Aus 1st innings total stands at 129 wickets, only 2 away from the record.

*  Bumrah **45** 

* Shami **45**

* Ishant **39**

No. of matches played for each record - 



Trio | Year | Wickets | Matches
---|---|----|----
Garner/holding/marshall| 1984| 130| 15
Bumrah/Shami/Ishant| 2018 | 129| 14
Morkel/Ntini/Steyn| 2008| 123| 15
Ambrose/marshall/Walsh| 1988| 118| 11
Morkel/Philander/Steyn| 2012| 108| 10


#EDIT
As some have pointed out, and I agree, that this is in no way proof or indicator that these three are better than the greats mentioned in the list. There are too many variables like home/away split, no. of matches they played together, quality of opposition etc. The thing to emphasize here is that they are 'among the best' and it was something unprecedented from Indian team. I remember the time when Venkatesh Prasad's fast deliveries were slower than Kumble's slow ones.

The current crop have been brilliant. If only our batting line up were a little more consistent overseas, we'd have won more than one Test in each of those series outside of India. If our batting was consistent, we could have won the series in England and Australia.  Is this for when the three of them played together? Or if in one match Umesh was in instead of Shami, for example, would the other two's wickets still add up to the total? Misleading stat. For every other trio they are showing the stats for games all played together, whereas for Indian bowlers their grand totals for the year are taken into account. Bumrah missed first 2 tests in Eng which Shami and Ishant played. For Grand totals Steyn,Ntini,Morkel have 171 in 2008 but they show only 123


Edit: looks it’s only away for away tests but it’s not doing justice to other bowlers as their away test matches include not so pacer friendly pitches of subcontinent. 

with Bumrah’s introduction Indian bowling has definitely improved in tests TBH I'm surprised Jimmy+Broad+Woakes/Stokes/Bresnan/Misc don't feature in the top 5. What about the number of matches played? I hope SENA keeps preparing bowler friendly like they have this season.  Some people are laughing that cricket is followed with such a Zeal in a former colonial state... 

I mean it's one thing to beat them on their own turf, and another abandoning all reason and sports.  Awesome.. but no terror in the heart .. which Holding and company invoked. Bumrah has really shown immense talent n balled on spot Interestingly enough this stat isn’t showing how many matches they played for those wickets I’m sure India plays 3 times more test in a year than those guys ever did  Wonderful stat...Bumrah has certainly the potential to become the greatest Indian pace bowler of all time And this is excluding bhuvi's contribution Fuck cricket. [deleted] Wow..  surprisingly there are no Australians  Yeah but back then there was no match fixing. Today all matches are more or less fixed, so can't say that the information or statistics are accurate. Doesn't cricket get enough media attention already? Rather bland content considering this is reddit.
Just my opinion that's all. I don't particularly like or dislike cricket,but I am rather tired of reading about it everywhere.
For instance, recently, we partook in a Hockey world cup and were consequently eliminated in the quarter-finals. All the newspapers I have access to either relegated this news to the last page favouring the test match against Australia over it, or didn't mention it at all. I get that they're trying to sell their papers, albeit I think a full fledged world-cup takes precedence over a run-off-the-mill test match.
We are hasteful to be delighted about our athletes performing well in various sports, albeit when it comes to supporting those very athletes, we turn our backs and cast them a blind eye.
India needs to learn to comprehend and be privy to all of its talent, not just a select few. I find it rather sad, or moreover callous that Sunil Chhetri had to do what he did just to get people to come and watch the national team play ON HOME SOIL. Very very sad indeed.

EDIT: Grammar  r/cricket Proud to be an INDIAN Cricket is overrated

Sports,"Can we appreciate the fact that Aamir khan has covered movies on all aspects of life. Education, Friendship, Patriotism, Mental Issues, Terrorism, Sports, Religion.",232,5kpnbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5kpnbm/can_we_appreciate_the_fact_that_aamir_khan_has/,243,"in Bollywood where 90% of the movies are BS (yes we have some sensible filmmakers like kashyap etc) aamir khan has more or less been a fresh air.

Yes the intolerance stuff and some of his other initiatives, people are polarized but you have to accept he has setup a quality benchmark in bollywood in main stream movies.

Thoughts ?",MRCGuy," So what? SRK has covered different personalities of a guy called Raj. He started this thing of doing 1 or 2 movies a year when he was around 27 years old in 1992. I think it takes a lot of courage to not believe in acceptable common wisdom at his time and stick to what he believed in. At that age, it sounds even crazier.  People would have told him that he's missing the chance to mint money at his peak and he didn't listen to them.  ITT: Edgy randians who think they have great taste in cinema. Well said.....making entertaining while being inspiring movies, he has consistently set the benchmark. While dangal might have not worked for me to that 'Amir khan' extent, I still loved it though. Also Satyamev Jayate making people think about causes which affects us as a society added extra points for him.I love him as an actor and a dedicated professional.
Hope we get more of these golden thought provoking movies than endless mind-numbing ""entertainers"".
 Aamir has done lot of shit movies before Lagaan . But post Lagaan he has been quite successful at working with good scripts and maintaining stardom.

Currently no other mainstream actor  can match

* Dil Chahta hai
* Lagaan
* Rang De Basanti
* TZP
* 3 Idiots
* PK
* Talaash
* Dangal
 100% agree! I love his movies from Dil Chata Hai to 3 Idiots to Fanaa to Mangal Pandey, and everything else I've seen of his.  but he is an anti-national agent of pakistan for merely voicing his opinion that India is becoming intolerant... I like Aamir Khan and admire the fact that he hasnt gone the way of the other Khans, but best Aamir was the Aamir of Sarfarosh and Ghulam

Lagaan was his peak and the epitome of the current Aamir we see today. But that also started the trend of Aamir the SJW, which is sad because the Aamir of Sarfarosh and Ghulam was doing the same without the preachiness

Fuck man, I'm gonna watch Ghulam again today May be you are a teenager so not exposed to good work SRK has done. .

You should watch

Deewana,,baazigar, Darr, Anjaam, kabhi ha kabhi na, chak de, swades, hey ram.  And he doesnt have a national award ..somebody should just give him for this one But where's the sax? He is good, except in Dhoom 3. Him and SRK. Off the top of my head:
1. Swades (patriotism)
2. Chak De India (sports)
3. Dear Zindagi (health issues)
... PK was a melodramatic holier than thou pile of shit,3 idiots also to a lesser degree.

 > Yes the intolerance stuff and some of his other initiatives, people are polarized

I find that quite funny. The general right-wing narrative about Bollywood is that the whole industry is a Muslim conspiracy to undermine and subvert Hinduism, with possible connections to radical extremism.

Aamir Khan, to their surprise, doesn't quite fit the criteria. He opposed regressive Indian practices focussed around Hinduism, sure, but he is also not well-liked within conservative Muslim communities. He is openly Feminist, pro-LGBT rights, and pro-freethinker/anti-organized-religion. He also contributes to a lot of charities, and never said anything explicitly against Hinduism, and often promoted religious harmony, without using divisive tactics. He also made many movies promoting Indian Freedom Movement and they were explicitly anti-Colonial and anti-British. 

So there is a huge anger against Amir Khan, but most of it comes out as ""He is over-rated and one day he will be exposed"" in a very shaking angry voice. There is absolutely nothing major which his political opponents can accuse him of. They cannot call him Anti-National, Colonial-McalayPutra, Pro-Muslim or anything. So it's just clattering teeth and shaking fists. I think Dangal was a pretty good movie. Nice job by Aamir Khan there.  Sarfarosh, Raja Hindustani, Ghulam, Andaz apna apna, Ghajini, Mann, Akele hum Akele tum


So many better movies to mention, AK is quality. loved Dangal. A true Indian National!  I find all his movies same. Central character trying to change things around or sending some message. To the point that they seem too preachy and cringy. And it's not that people are going to really change because of his movies. Bollywood doesn't need movies with messages, it needs well made movies. Personally I think lot of this depends on director and writers. Raju k Hirani, VVC, Farhan Akhtar, Rakesh Om Prakash etc are all good directors/writers. Even TZP had Amol Gupte who basically wrote the whole thing. I highly doubt if any other good actor cannot act in his shoes. Compare this with SRK who I think has done much more varied roles and is quite upfront about his entertainment value. Basically question comes down to two thing: has Aamir Khan added value to Bollywood and Indian film industry? Yes he has and he should be appreciated for that. Is he a great actor? No, I don't think so. No, why we have to appreciate some dude doing things for money. Don't we have better things to do? Stop sucking media people dick. Amir khan is over rated. He makes tatti movies but presents them like swiss chocolate and gullible people like you ,who are not exposed to quality cinema , relish it.

Amir khan worked in Fanaa. Enough said.  On all aspects of life? ..let's see with SRK


1- Deewana : widow marriage

2 - Darr : Mental Issues ( Psycho he was )

3 : Koyala :  Disability ( he was mute )

4 : chak De : Sports

5 :  kabhi Albida na kehna : extra marital affair 

6 :  Mohabbatain : Education ( he was a teacher )

7 : Dil se : Terrorism

8 : kal ho na ho : Death ( He died in the end )

I could go on and on but I think you get the hint what I am trying to say.SRK has done almost all aspects of life. Aamir has touched only few. Nope. Hes just a great marketer who knows what Indian pseudo-intellectual junta wants. Zero film-making talent and guts to do anything real. 3 Idiots is hot garbage. And so is PK. [removed] He is a good actor, yes, but many topics of his own films are contradictory to each other. So, for now, I will just appreciate him for being a good actor. I don't know.. I kind of feel Aamir is a bit pretentious. I still don't understand why he is categorically against Indian awards.  ITT a lot of folks confused between great actor and ability to choose quality/different scripts. 

In Telugu movies, I can see sharwanand and Nani making good movies because they choose scripts different from usual masala stuff. Sharwanand has same  expressions (like Aamir and SRK) in every movie but I still watch his movies.  people who think 3 idiots is a great movie .. i bet that half of the jokes you see were in tinkle comics ages back.

Having said that , the movie had an amazing message which was really inspiring.",2016-12-28 18:38:37

**Current Medal Tally**

India's medal tally as of now: 15 Gold, 24 Silver, 30 Bronze.

India is currently at the 8th position in [the medal table](https://m.sportskeeda.com/sports/asian-games-medals-table).

**Note**: Regular updates and schedule in the comments. 

**The Games have ended!**",snicker33," Update - Hockey: India wins Men's Hockey Pool A Prelims, beating Hong Kong by 26-0. WTF?! Update - Gymnastics: Dipa Karmakar qualifies for the final of the beam event. Apparently, Iranian women's Kabaddi coach is from India and wanted to coach the Indian team but never got the opportunity. She then decided to accept the Iranian offer to prove her mettle. Hi all,

To those not aware one of the reasons for India's better showings at Asian Games,CWG and Olympics is due to several previous sportsmen like Geet Sethi, Prakash Padukone, Pulella Gopichand and Rahul Dravid and their foundations [Olympic Gold Quest](https://www.olympicgoldquest.in/) and [GoSports](http://www.gosportsfoundation.in/) who support several players like Duttee Chand, Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, Swapna Barman and many more. You can check their websites for more information.

If you would like to donate to any of these you can do at [Gosports](http://www.gosportsfoundation.in/donate_now.php) and [Olympic Gold Quest](https://www.olympicgoldquest.in/donate-now.php) Not relevant but India got a bronze in eSports! Hima Das is absolute beast.  Neeraj Chopra has won the gold !!!! What an athlete.  Four valid throws and all well above 80m. The fact that his least throw was better than silver medalist's best is a testimony of how good the guy is.  8 gold medals denied to India by Bahrain+Qatar. 1 Gold denied to China.
If there were no Bahrain+Qatar.
India would have 15 Golds to China's 13 and be number 1 in athletics in Asia. Quite a feat by our athletics team. Holy fack!! 88.06m at the age of 20. Neeraj Chopra, what a guy. So that concludes the athletics events at 2018 Asian Games. What a superb performance by Indian athletics contingent winning 19 medals(7 gold, 10 silver amd 2 bronze). Update - Swimming: Virdhawal Khade finishes 4th in Men's 50m Freestyle Final clocking 22.47s. 

Missed Bronze by 0.01 seconds! Update: India's women Kabaddi team finishes on top of table, qualifies for semi-finals.  Update - Tennis: Rohan Bopanna and Sharan Divij enter semis, assure another medal for India

 Deepika kumari has been disappointing on every big ticket event. She goes into tournaments as world number 1 and  does really bad. The federation really needs to get her a mental conditioning coach asap. Sindhu is in the final !! I feel Bahain/Qatar's poaching of athletes only action will be taken when it starts to affect the US/UK and Jamaica in the Olympics. Update - Shooting: Rahi Sarnobat bags **Gold** in WOmen's 25m Pistol Final.  Men and women both lose to Iran in kabadi.
Great rivalry coming up for years to come.  Tajinderpal Singh Toor has won the gold medal in men's shot put. His best throw was of 20.75 m , which is also a new Asian Games record. Great work by him. Hopefully we will get more medal from athletics in the coming days. 3 gold medals in running denied because of Bahrain/Qatar buying off athletes. Out of a total of 7 medal events in Athletics in which Indian athletes were participating today, they won medals in four events (1 gold and 3 silver). Quite an impressing performance indeed. Damn Neeraj Chopra's score is good enough for an Olympic medal Update: Indian Men's Kabaddi Team beats Thailand with a score of 49-30, make their way into semi-finals.  Events in which India can win medal on Day 5 (23/08/2018):

1. Artistic Gymnastics - Women's Vault
2. Bowling - Men's Trios
3. Canoe - Single Women
4. Rowing - Men's Single Sculls

16. Swimming - Men's 200m Backstroke
17. Tennis - Women's Singles
18. Weightlifting - Men's 77kg [removed] Rohan Bopanna and Divij Sharan wins gold in Tennis Men's Doubles. I feel that if we consider the ""original"" Asians, the Indian athletes clearly dominate a lot of events.  The men's table tennis team have qualified for the semi-finals beating Japan by 3-1, also ensuring a medal in the process Pakistan has some grandpa playing against Achanta in TT Hima Das, you absolute beauty. 30m lead was way too much for the Africans to cover. Hockey and kabaddi both have been massively disappointing. Neeraj chopra taught himself the art of throwing a javelin by watching YouTube , reason why his throwing looks unconventional.  Later he had become world class under great coaches   Sindhu's biopic should be called Silver. Is Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore the first sports minister who is a former sportsperson ? Bc Asian record kyo keh rahe ho, call it African records. Events in which India can win medal on Day 13(31/08/2018):

A bronze at last. Yet India wasn't at full potential. Pakistan was breathing down our neck! Not a comprehensive win and lots to improve before world cup. But man, Harmanpreet is proving to be a great great player!  Narendar Grewal wins bronze in men's sanda 65kg. [Asian Games 2018: Indian rowers claim gold in quadruple sculls](https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/asian-games-2018-indian-rowers-claim-gold-in-quadruple-sculls/article24767931.ece?homepage=true) Compound Men Archery's team now in the finals. \^\_\^   


Except the last shot, Rajat Chauhan scored all 10's. We needed a 7 in the last one, he scored a comfortable 9. Great going, will surely catch the finals! We've got 4 medals in Athetics till now with 1 gold and 3 silver. That's an amazing achievement. There's still Neeraj Chopra. Hopefully he'll be able to get a gold for us.  88.06 Damn! Neeraj Chopra is the answer for decades long old wait for Olympic gold in athletics. We have lost the men's table tennis team semifinal to Korea. One more bronze for India. Good performance by Indian team to reach till the semis.  India are currently third in the medals tally for athletics. Only behind Bahrain and China. And already got more golds than in 2014. And maybe more medals to come. Very impressive. Gold in Heptathlon. Wow. Hopefully the women's hockey team will win the gold, thus helping us to reach 7th position in the medal tally.  Boria majumdar is hyperactive guy... zyada hi excited rehta hai... India women team win squash semis against fav malaysia... Now on to finals...good job deepika/chinappa... win a Gold Fck! Another gold in Bridge!! I'm dreaming? Best tally ever in all respects 🤙🏾🤙🏾 We can best hope for a bronze now from Ind vs Pak field hockey match. So we finally end our Asian Games campaign at 69 medals(highest ever) with 15 gold(equal to our highest ever), 24 silver(highest ever) and 30 bronze medals. Update - Tennis: Rohan Bopanna and Ankita Raina beat South Korea's Kim Nari and Jeamoon Lee in Mixed Doubles, make their way to quarter-finals.  Update - Wrestling: Divya Kakran has won the **Bronze Medal** in Women's Freestyle 96kg, beating Taipei's Chen Wenling by 10-0! 

 u/snicker33 good job with the updates.
Thanks  Update - Tennis: Medal confirmed for India as Ankita Raina wins quarterfinals in straight sets, clinches match 6-4 6-1. Heena Sidhu wins bronze in Women's 10m air pistol. Piss-poor performance by India's archery team and the weightlifting contingent. Also very disappointed by India's top male badminton players not being able to put up a decent performance. 

It's easier to win at Commonwealth Games where the competition isn't so severe but if you harbour dreams of winning a medal at the Olympics then you ought to win at the Asian Games at the least!

 Nirmla has also qualified alongside Hima Das for the final of Women's 400m. India: Korea :: 4:1.
Really good performance by our girls! Last quarter was a delight!  Hima Das wins silver. Gold lady was just too good. :/ Archery should have more points other than 10,9,8 system. Points in decimal as well for more accuracy.  As noone else seems to be doing it congrats to Sindhu for the silver, best ever achievement by an Indian badminton player at Asian games. Hima Das disqualified for False Start. Wtf, it's a nightmare!!  India has been truly robbed of 3 gold medals from the Bahrain brought athletes. 1st the 100m gold, then 400m and the 4x400m mixed relay. They aren't even indigenous Asians.  11 medals in athletics so far and none of them is a bronze. This says a lot about the performance of Indian athletics contingent. The have been very confident and have given their 100 percent in every event.  The gold and silver in men's 800m was miraculous and so was the silver in mixed relay.

Archery also ended on a positive note for India as we managed 2 silver medals.

Sindhu's silver was a historic moment. Waiting for her to bring gold very soon.

History was also created in Table Tennis as the bronze in men's team event was India's FIRST EVER medal of any kind in table tennis.

Kurash came as the surprise package of the day with India winning a silver and bronze in it. Getting a medal in an event dominated heavily by Uzbeks is no mean feat. Hopefully these medals will help in popularising this sport in the country.

​ Man manjit singh! What a champ!! Did anyone see that heat? Expecting a gold from Seema Punia. Hopefully she repeats her performance from the last edition.  Is it just me or scoring in boxing seems way too suspicious and shady? Jinson Johnson wins gold, to go with his silver in 800m. Manjit ends fourth, started sprinting thoda late. India have overtaken their 2014 medal tally, both in terms of gold and no. of medals (:  Commentators constantly calling the Bahrain athletes as Ethiopian and Kenyan athletes 😂 Damn what a run,Bahrain I think had 3 gold medallists,Hima Das's greatest moment so far at senior level. If we get 2 more gold medals then we will equal our record of maximum gold medals which was set in the first ever Asian Games in Delhi, 1951. Bros, sorry for this interjection. Seeing the number of sports fans here, can we please have a separate indian subreddit for sports?

I fear it may be flooded with Cricket. Assuming a few fans here would be interested, how to go about it? Our current tally of 23 silver medals is the most number of silver medals we have ever got in Asian Games. The second best is 19 silver medals in 1982 Delhi Asian Games. We  have reached 1000 comments  in this thread  one more record today So that's it? We end on 69? Bahrain and Qatar are participating in the wrong continental games.

Should be in the African one. Though find it amusing their athletes don't even murmur the national anthem 😂 Update - Swimming: Indian team qualifies for men’s 4x100m freestyle relay Final.  Update - Wrestling: India’s Harpreet Singh wins his bout against Heageun Park of Korea 4-1. He now enters the quarters.

 PV Sindhu enters quarterfinal by beating Indonesia's Tunjung GM by two games to nil. A huge upset in Squash as Goshal, the top seed is defeated. Very disappointing. 

Not much hope in Athetics other than Mohammed Anas, Dutee Chand and Neeraj Chopra.

I think we will fall woefully shot of gold medals this time and even overall medal when compared to 2014. Hima Das has qualified for women's 400m final. Indian team has won silver in Equestrian Eventing Team. The Indian team consisted of  Rakesh Kumar, Ashish Malik, Jitender Singh and Fouaad Mirza. Saina Nehwal is into the semifinal of women's singles after defeating Ratchanok Intanon. Sony needs to get better commentators (the analysts are ok I guess)  ,these seem of the old Doordarshan quality,not expecting them to have in depth knowledge but should know at least the basic rules  /nuances of games India are good in,during archery the commentator thought games was over after 21 out of 24 shots,despite Korea clearly keeping on shooting,a few days back he was screaming how an Indian wrestler was amazing in his defence in last few minutes as he won the last point only for the referee to raise the opponents hand(didn’t stop him screaming though),another one assured us of a medal for reaching the sf (he went on to lose the repechage),boxing guy has no confidence to say who is winning though I guess he honestly doesn’t make an attempt . We won two Silver medals in Equestrian - one for a team event and another an individual one.

Not too many people follow the sport but it's a great a achievement nonetheless. India vs S.Korea in both Men's & Women's compound archery team final Dutee Chand silver ,lost by 0.02s Goving Lakshmanan who earlier won the bronze in 10000 m race has been disqualified because his foot touched inside the race track. Gonna be a very tough fight for both Saina and Sindhu. Sania has to gave the world number 1 and Sindhu has to play the world number 2. It's not gonna be easy! 

If the two end up beating their opponent, then it's richly deserving.

I have a feeling that Saina may do better than Sindhu. But let's hope both these wonderful women win.  A lot of athletics action is coming up from 5:10 PM. Also the quarterfinals of men's and women' team in table tennis. Dharun Ayyasamy has won the silver in men's 400m hurdles. Excellent run by him, especially in the last 50m to rob the Japanese of the silver. Sudha Singh has won the silver in women's 3000m steeplechase. She won the gold in the same event in 2014 Asian Games.  Neeraj Chopra, my man. Silver for India in women's compound archery team event after losing to South Korea in the final. 

Final score : Korea: 231 India: 228

Muskan Kirar and Madhumita Kumari failed to get their best shots as the match progressed. Although excellent shooting by Jyothi Surekha Vennam. Archery: Most bizarre rules I've ever seen. But they tried their best.  So so many Bahrain-Qatar wins in tracks. Asia doesn't even have that 5 year IOA rule. Fuck them. There was a guy who has his brother playing for Nigeria. Just read about Tejinder Pal Singh shot put gold winner . He switched from cricket to shot put. Cannot imagine that dude playing cricket now with that physique. Hima Das almost caused another disqualification with that obstruction. At this point might just call them Afro-Asian Games. The Chinese boxer was all over Vikas. But Vikas won the bout. Dutee Chand, another Silver. Damn, she is a superstar. Almost beat the ""imported"" Bahrain girl. I was severely depressed at Indian loss. I am an ardent hockey follower, and I knew Malaysia is a though but to crack. But it turned out to be reinforced concrete. It's so so disappointing.  5th straight gold in womens 4x400m. We have been winning this since 2002. Amazing! 3 medals in sailing for India today. 1 silver and 2 bronze. We have 62 medals now, 3 away from equalling our record of total medals of 65, made in 2010 Asian Games. Gcttirth gets demo bronze in hearthstone. I think we are in for another disappointment in hockey.  As squash doesn't seem to be covered I guess boxing final  is the last thing we have left to watch.(other than e sports). GOLD!  Anyone watched the hockey finals?!! What an absolute cracker of a match!! Update- Wrestling: Harpreet wins his bout against Sumi Masato 8-0, enters semis. Another medal assured for India. 

 Santosh Kumar wins bronze in Men's Sanda 56kg.

&#x200B; 15 year old Shardul Vihan wins silver in double trap shooting!  Indian hockey team defeats Japan by 8-0. Disappointing performance by India in Kabaddi and Badminton. India's future in shooting looks so good, lots of young stars are coming up. No one wants to play squash, I don't see any more stars coming up in squash after these four.

Hima Das(3), Md. Anas Yahiya(3), Jinson Johnson(2), Dutee Chand(2), Arokiarajiv(2), Dharin Ayyasamy(2), Fouaad Mirza(2), Sharath Achanta Kamal(2). Gnanasekaran though to Men's Table tennis round of 16. Had a good game against Indonesian. Today is going to be a historic day for India in its Asian Games history. Today we will surpass our previous best of a total of 65 medals at 2010 Asian Games. We can also equal our record of 15 gold medals of 1951 Asian Games today as we need only two more gold. Boxing and Sqaush is our best bet to get those two golds. And if we get three gold, then it will be our best ever Asian Games in terms of gold and total medals won. Great games for India. Thank you all for showing interest.  It was a great journey! 69, oh holy number! We have improved vastly and it would have been (it is technically) our best performance, if not for damned Bahrain and Qatar.  This was Sindhu's 5th final loss of the year...must be so frustrating to lose so many finals. I feel like she's been number 2 number 3 for the longest time and in that time a bunch of people have occupied the number 1 position and won something significant (Marin was number 1 for a while, Ratchanok was 1, Li Xuerui was 1 and now Asiad finals). I do hope she starts winning. 

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, I'm just an armchair critic who's sad at her loss and only hope that she goes up from here.  Update - Wushu: India’s Roshibina Devi Naorem has beaten Pakistan’s Mubashra in the Women’s Sanda 60kg quarter-finals.

The Iranian opponent also showed some great sportsman spirit. Gunneshwaran Prabhakaran gets bronze in Tennis men's singles. Update - Badminton: Saina Nehwal reaches quarter finals, defeating Indonesia's Fitriani.  Dipika Pallikal Karthik gets the bronze medal in Women's Squash after losing to Malaysia's Nicol Ann David. Fouaad Mirza has won the silver in Equestrian Eventing Individual. Women's compound archery team has reached the final after defeating Chinese Taipei. Finally some good new in archery for India. PV Sindhu is in the semi-final of badminton women's singles. Now 2 medals are assured in badminton for India. India need to win its tie against Iran, DPRK has already upset Japan in Group B, so if we finish 2nd behind China we would face DPRK in QFs. Update: Dutee Chand wins **silver medal** for India. Gold and Bronze medalists have difference of 0.03 seconds. What a race! Sudha singh on her way to Silver in Steeplechase.

Edit: Nope.

Double Edit: Yup. Neena Varakil is giving her everything in women's long jump to get the gold  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWfyPrlQrEo

Check out this video from 5 min onwards to know how hyperandrogenism is treated unfairly by Americans loaded IAAF. Dutee Chand fought her suspension in CAS and then came back to win like Caster Semenya. Am I mistaken in thinking CWG Delhi had good crowds than here in Indonesia especially the marquee sports of athletics arena being almost empty.

They were shooting superbly and totally deserved the gold medal.

 In the mixed relays, Hima ran her lap in the second lane for half the race, until she realized that there was no lane at all, and then switched to the first lane.

Dont think we would have got the gold anyway but would have been a much closer finish. Boxing: Amit Panghal is through to the semi-final and India are assured of a BRONZE medal. I have to say amateur boxing is not exciting to watch. You think this guy is winning even the commentators get it wrong , but the judges choose the other opponent. No live scoring till the end of the match. Gold for Arpinder Singh. Gold for Arpindar. Bravo! Finally we are in double digit golds Events in which India can win a medal at Day 12 (30/08/2018) :

6:30 p.m.:- Athletics [Finals - Men's 4*400 m. Relay Team and Women's 4*400 m. Relay Team] Women's 4 X 400m , Gold. Silver in men's 4 x 400m relay. A good race by the Indian athletes. Losing to those imported athletes is not a true loss in my opinion. The third lap was crucial in surpassing Japan. Also nice trigger in the last stretch. Neither any of the channels nor sonyliv are broadcasting the squash semis. Any place else? 

Edit : Women’s team are through to the final. Will either face Hong Kong or Japan Amit into finals of Boxing !  I am so pissed man. No television broadcast of squash final. Finally India's winning tons of medals in sports somewhere. Why do we do so well in the Asian games but struggle in the Olympics? Fuck those oil rich middle Eastern countries buying their way to the Athletics medals. BC...this is turning out to be choking day. We have lost almost all games today... archery 2 final losses, badminton final loss, TT semi loss, volleyball qf loss against pak...boxing started with loss in quarters for sonia... All hopes now for athletics it seems... Why wasn't the football team sent to the games? I read that it was because they were considered unlikely to win a medal. However, Vietnam, a team much behind India in the FIFA rankings, are in contention for bronze tomorrow. Even Pakistan and Bangladesh sent their teams. I don't really understand this decision, especially with the rapid traction football has been gaining lately.   Update - Gymnastics: Indian women team qualifies for the final, finishing 7th on the table. Update - Tennis: Prajnesh Gunneswaran beats South Korea's Kwon Soon-woo. A medal assured for India in Men's Singles.  Update - Squash: Dipika Pallikal beats Indonesia's Rohmah Yeni Siti 3-0 in women’s singles Round of 16.

​ Compound Men's team reaches the semis! Man these games are all so nerve-wrecking. Seemed like an easy win, but two shots of 8 and they needed a 10 to win...and he did it. So exciting. Indian men's compound archery team is also in the semi-finals. Great display of marksmanship. The ending was a bit nervous for India after they lost their comfortable 3 points lead due to two 8 point shots. But the final shot of 10 points ensured India's win with the score of 227 against Philippines' 226.  India wins brone in Bridge men's team and mixed team events. Md. Anas Ahiya wins silver in Men's 400m Santosh Kumar Tamilrasan has qualified for final of 400m hurdles. Govindan L has lost his bronze as he has been disqualified. Vey sad incident.

 Saina Nehwal gets the bronze after losing to Tai Tzuying in the semi final. She played good till 14-15 points in both the games but lost her momentum after it. WHere can i watch mens table tennis? 

Ten sports, Sony, etc is all actively discussing Dutee Chands 100m in the studio for the 100th time today. SHow us the events, goddamit! PV Sindhu has lost the gold medal by playing probably her worst final ever. Loose shots and low confidence. She needs to come out of the mental block she faces while playing in the finals. Don't know why she starts looking quite ordinary in finals compared to the earlier matches in a tournament. We got a bad beating today. No gold. Guess hockey and athletics are the only hope.  Pincky Balhara gets the silver in Kurash !! Very good performance by her to reach till the final and get the silver Fck man! I hate bahrain ..importing atheletes from africa( powerhouse in running/atheletics) ..even in women's 5000m now .
Feel like they robbed india of so many golds :-/ Fck! Another imported gold for bahrain :-/ Mixed team track event looks fun. And yet again ...robbed of a gold by Bah-fc-rain! Volleyball me I think they have bought firangis from Europe or America. Manika Batra is hot! First Indian female medallist in the history of TT So are we winning any medals today apart from Athletics? We scored 76 goals in the tournament and still not in final ffs  We beat Bahrain in track. WOMEN WIN GOLD IN 4x400m. WHAT A RACE!  All throw events in women China won gold. 4 straight golds. These throw events we have a better chance than beating African imports who even the world's best cannot beat. What is India's best rank ever in Asian Games and when? Vikas out with an injury. Lots of news reporting that he won't play his semi final and will settle for the bronze. The cut he received above his eye in the previous match is impairing his vision.

She was very fast right from the beginning.  Jinson Johnson has qualified for the 800m final after winning the heat 1. Table Tennis Women's Team is Out in QF, they lost to Hong Kong 3-1. Hoping Men's Team can win their match. Singles will be even tougher. Indian women's TT team has lost in the quarterfinal to Hong Kong. Sindu lost first set. Fingers crossed. Hope it gets to third set. Wtf is up with sindhu? Sindhu settles for silver. She wasn't in rhythm today. Tai Tzu played phenomenal. Hats off. Badminton women's final: Happened what everyone on Reddit expected. Sindhu needs to work on her final-phobia. Boxing womens featherweight (57kg) quarterfinals 

  Sonia Lather(IND) vs jo son hwa(PKR) start ho gaya bhailog Boxing womens featherweight (57kg) quarterfinals 

Sonia Lather(IND) vs jo son hwa(PRK) 

  We lost PRK dominated all three bouts
 So looks like this is it..only hockey is gold prospect now? Or do we have more gold opportunities(Wrestling maybe?) Jinson Johnson comes in with the best time from the semis. Hope he runs the race of his life. I dont think an Indian guy won the Asiad gold in 800m since Charles Borromeo in 1982. Pinky Balhara and MY Jadhav has reached the semi finals in Kurash women's -52kg ensuring 2 bronze medals for India. Okay guys Women's heptathlon has resumed with shot put event. We are currently at number 1 and number 3 position. Dutee Chand has qualified for 200m final by winning the semifinal 1. Hopefully Hima Das will too. Hima Das has been disqualified. Wtf is happening in this race. Don't they give warning or anything? I don't know much about Kurash but one thing is sure that Uzbeks are too good in it. Pincky Balhara has reached the final in Kurash !! She has ensured a silver for the country. Great performance by the 19yo. Just came to know from the commentary that Kurash originated in Uzbekistan. Explain why the Uzbeks are so good in it. any idea why the athletics stadium is 75% empty? I thought the Asian Games is a premier event which would attract lotsa crowds.  most of the top asian athletes are competing. probably low level of interest in a country like Indonesia.  India wins silver in mixed 4x400m relay. Fuckin' African-Baharainins Is dutee chand's race left today? What events does India have a chance to win tomorrow?  Barman is first with only the 800 meters left and the second place athlete and her have identical personal bests in the 800 meters. Hembram is in 4th and probably more difficult for her to medal. Why can we let those Bahraini athletes participate? So we can buy medals now; then where's the sport I reckon. Where's the patriotism and sportsmanship?  Achanta/Manika - India's best ever in TT are up against North Korea in Mixed doubles QF. Win here will assure another historic medal in TT.  Watched yesterday's highlights.
What did happen in men compound archery team? We were almost at cusp of winning gold medal.

Neeraj Chopra is surely my star. Hoping for Olympic medal tbh. 

 Second table tennis medal confirmed in mixed doubles for the first time ever. This has been India's best games. At least a bronze for TT mixed team! Man it was a bp rising game.  TT SF : Achanta,Manika against two boys 10 golds bhai ..update the thread 😁 The direct feed commentators are so much better than the Sony ones. They don't even bother to do basic research about scoring system of the events they are covering. India lose relay appeal and squash women's team are in the semis. This Salwa Naseer from Bahrain just ran 4x100m relay and boy she was lethal. Feel for the Chinese for losing their gold to them though.

It surprising that she runs 100m, 200m and 400m  Seema Punia settles for Bronze in Discuss Throw When did the Malaysian team get so good? I'm not a regular hockey follower, but I remember so many games of India mauling Malaysia. What a gold in Women's 4X400m relay for India. Simply superb. Mens relay is more difficult..fuck... JApan ka lambu is kickass runner... and bahrain aur qatar imports toh hai hi Where is the best place to watch all the highlights? Like the womens 4x400m relay? 2 more medals in sailing - one silver and one bronze Esports semifinals is on. Glad to see india in there. Any more Golds up for grabs? One more strong gold medal prospect remaining for India today : Sqaush How come there's 3 Korea on the medal table? Anybody?  [China's humble brag not enough space in newspapers for all medal winners](http://www.espn.in/espn/story/_/id/24489130/china-asian-games-where-gold-always-good-enough) Anyone else thinks that PV Sindhu loses her nerve in any tournament final? Silver in men's .Beaten By Africa. Qatar(Africa) wins the men's 4X400. India settles for silver. Ayaz taking a dig at Boria for not knowing about Sailing,Boria with his usual overconfidence (mis)calculated all medal prospects the other day and didn't even mention sailing. Love some good banter xD Roshibina Devi wins bronze in Women's Sanda 60kg. We've come a long way from the first Olympic gold. The next olympics will definitely be the best so far Bridge mens pair gold.   

edit. so we match 15 golds. Armchair critics doing their work here it seems.
We did well this Asian games,last time was really disappointing, winning or losing is just a part of it. I don't see anyone complaining when we beat the Africans in women's 4x400 relay,which was a huge upset. Why complain now? Our women's hockey team in particular had a great game, we should appreciate it not demean them.
Only disappointment for me was men's badminton and our kabaddi performance,even there , people who had seen the last Asiad final between india and iran men's, should know that it was on the cards.

Tl;dr : a great Asian Games for india and we should be proud of our athletes.

 That shooting match in which Rajput won the silver, it was intense  [deleted] [deleted] Did India not qualify for the football event. Are they so bad in Asia too? Ankita Raina wins bronze in Tennis Women's Singles. 4 point lead for iran. 14 minutes remain. will be a massive shock if we lose. ajay thakur is all bloody and not likely to play anymore  5 point lead, 5 minutes to go. come on guys!! Olympics mein to hai hee nahi ab our one confirmed gold in the asian games is being taken away :( Update - Squash: Joshna Chinappa settles for **Bronze** after losing in the women’s semi-finals to Malaysia's Sivasangari Subramaniam.

 Update - Handball: The Indian women’s handball team defeat Malaysia 54-19 in their Classification 9th-10th Place match. Dutee Chand match link? Anyone. Please. Is there a 100m sprint? Wanna see who the fastest in Asia is. What is the progress in Womens Decathalon...last i saw barman was leading...this was after the high jump...any more updates...can't watch... India vs Pakistan in Volleyball. India is leading by 1 set to nil. It is a quarterfinal for 7-12. Men's archery team is playing at God Level. 6 out of 6 perfect 10s. Indian Archers are killing it!!

may defeat the world champions korea! Haha it's tied again.  Looks like players from other sports have left it to athletics to bring the gold medals in the seond half of this Asian Games. Swapna Barman is such a fighter. Giving her PB in shot put with a facial injury.  Tf is happwning!! Yaqoob Yaqoob. The name so nice you say it twice. A bronze and an assured silver in Kurash. Very proud moment for the athletes and the country. Mallaprabha Jadhav has won the bronze medal in Kurash. Why do Qatar and Bahrain care about medals anyway? Indian athletes in 20km walk disqualified ? Anyone know the reason ? swapna barman just threw her lifetime best over 50 meters in the javelin. She is back in the lead in the heptathlon. Crucial boxing QFs have begun... 4 Indians are in fray. Boxing has been most disappointing so far with zero medals. Why were male boxers bout without head protection but female is with ? Right, so athletic events of the day has begun... medal hopefuls - Arpindar in Triple Jump, Swapna Barman in Heptathlon, Dutee in 200m and qualifications of Manjit, Johnson in 1500 finals and Indian team in 4x400 relay...
There is also Womens hockey semi and boxer Dheeraj in QF coming up... more medal hopefuls Wasnt indian women's hockey at 4:30 today?
 Dutee Chand another silver(200m). Another silver in womens 200m thanks to Bahrain Thankfully we won 2 medals in boxing today in last leg. Hopefully they will turn it into Gold to save some face. Like Kabaddi, another disappointment this year. 
2014 - 5,
2010 - 9 Arpinder Singh is leading in men's triple jump. Uhh what? No manjit and johnson both are there 1 medal away from equaling 2014 medal tally Any events remaining for the day for India besides hockey ? Bronze in Women’s 1500m Lost to Malaysia in semi final during shoot out 6-7, Hockey men's. India lose the hockey semi-final similar story against Australia they are terrible in these shootouts. Lost to Malaysia in Men's Hockey. I was hoping for the India Pakistan final. :( Malaysia deserved to win they kept their heads throughout,going down to 9 men while ahead was utter nonsense,having said this  I don’t understand how was our first penalty even close to an obstruction. Any hope for any more gold medals? Boxing or Womens Squash? And yeah women's hockey! Bahrain won a gold + silver in 2016 olympics. Next games definitely they can get 7+ medals. Manika not able to pick the back spin of the boy. We are trailing 0 -1 in squash women's team final. Anyone know when is the final football match? I love how a lot of medals have come from athletics off late! Do you think it's because of improvement in training facilities over the last 2-3 years?  I don't know why Indian women's team is so dumb. This was a simple dumb play. Either we are dumb, or Japanese are very smart. Wasting 6 minutes allowing Japan to dribble the puck as much as they like when you are 1 goal down in the final quarter. Wow! Come on! What do you have to lose by attacking when you are 1 goal down! Yet India defended like crazy. Japan outplayed us. I am disappointed cause present Indian team has more potential. Both guys and girls. 

So no gold from hockey, yet again. I expected 2 golds considering their form and skill.  Just saw the compound women archery QF(?). What a game! They were trailing by 3 points and just before the last round it was all tied somehow. Three shots left and India got 10 on each shot! Really fun to watch.

Edit : It was the SF! They are into the finals!

That is quite a leap even for home games. What do you think is the reason ? There is clearly a gulf between Tai and other current women players. Sindhu has got more power in her smashes because of her larger stature but she isn't swift off her feet. She couldn't pick many of the drop shots she should have India out of boxing without a medal. But seriously man empty stadiums are so disappointing..can only imagine what thr atheletes must feel like :-( Op, now we are 8th. Update it please. our Table Tennis campaign ends with 2 bronze,great improvement in a world class field,Men's team and specifically Achantha did very well,room for little improvement in women's section.
All in all ,a great outing. One more gold and this will become our best ever Asian Games in terms of gold as well as overall medals. North Korea has more medals than INDIA. FTW. Man i cant get over the fact that if bahrain hadnt cheated us of golds we'd be number 5 ahead of iran at like 20 golds Gold done and dusted for the archery team  Do you need different body types for discus/hammer/shotput throw ? Never see athletes competing in both events. In swimming and track so many athletes do multiple events. Does anybody know how strong are Bahrain in women's 4x400 relay. If not for them, that's a strong gold prospect for us tomorrow. [deleted] when is manu bhaker's final?  Congratulations Anyway to watch the India v Iran Semi-Final Kabaddi match online?

Lmao that chutiya from philipine didnt even know how to do the eye celebration. How many more events in hepthathalon? We are 1 medal away from 50 medals. What's the next even for India? China has won 6 gold medals in throw and jump events. 4 in women's events which is much easier. When is the men's final for 1500? WTF...women hepthatlon 800m is divided into 2 heats? this is confusing...our players are in 2nd race Why is Vikas Gowda not competing?  [deleted] Girls are not really playing well in hockey semi. We gotta win this, cmon yaar. Need 2 golds in hockey. 
 Hockey semi in the shootouts, 1-1. Other than 5000m any event left for India? Anyone knows where can I watch Sharath Kamal’s round of 16? 

Edit : He lost the round of 16.  How's india men's squash semis looking? Now I know why people were pissed after France won the FIFA World Cup We need to target field events in high jump,long jump,triple jump,pole vault and throwing events to win gold medals. Difficult to beat powerhouses \s like Bahrain and Qatar in track  Hoping Manika Batra defeats all the boys to a medal. Why the fuck is this thread not stickied?

Edit: Someone stickied it now. Thankfully. And with kazak gold india gets pushed down further :-/ ALL EXCITED FOR 11:40AM GAME. Come on Sindhuuuuuuuu!!❤️ Damn! That bahrainian chic was HOT!! no 4 x 100 teams for India?

also nobody in 100, 200m for men? [deleted] [deleted] [Hong Kong Goalie](https://en.asiangames2018.id/athletes/athlete/CHAN-Hou-Fung-3027041/)

Sports,This is massive! India wins 368 medals at Special Olympics Summer Games! Kudos!,2005,b57vwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b57vwb/this_is_massive_india_wins_368_medals_at_special/,79,"In one of the best sports performances in Indian history, Indian team of 284 athletes have clinched 368 medals at the prestigious Special Olympics World Summer Games held at Abu Dhabi between Mar 14 to 21.

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I've seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)

These are the smiles that deserved extensive coverage in the media. They deserved interviews. Their stories deserved to be told. They have the potential to inspire and change lives. But, alas, hardly did we even realize that such an incredible feat was even accomplished in India. 

",askquestionsdude," My cousin won a silver and a bronze. Extremely proud moment for our family. Special athletes : wins 368 medals at special Olympics 

Media : sleeps 

Any popular ultra rich cricketer : *breaths*

Media : क्यों लेते है क्रिकेटर्स सांस , जानने के लिए देखिये यह स्पेशल एपिसोड  * calls experts like Kapil Dev  or gautum gambhir *  Superb !!

Why is mainstream media refusing to cover this on telly ?

Fuck you TRP whores 85 Gold Medals?  Wow!
 Sadly our mainstream media is too busy choking on the dicks of irrelevant news topics like mandir yahi banaayenge and bollywood gossips..... These people are the true gems of our nation and deserve all the respect and honour. Congratulations to the team!  still no coverage in our media. 

Each victory count. We always taje normal well being as granted. These people struggled hard for very basic stuff that we think is normal. 
To overcome a natural disability, to contest and emerge as champion takes helluva of courage and dedication.

This put a smile on my face.

Go Team India. Congratulations to the ""INDIVIDUALS"" who won the medals with their hard work and dedication, proud of them! Wow. Great news. Congrats to all of them!!! You make us feel proud in the true sense.

 [deleted] Congratulations to all the participants! You made us proud! Wow those pictures are beautiful. Goes on to show that India's grit in the face of hardship is unmatched.  I recently worked with a team of specially abled Indian cultural team of dancers and singers in USA. 

One visually impaired singer has burned every information about movies, Kannada, Hindi, Tamil & Telugu in his head. You give him a movie, he spits out the music composer, actors, date of movie release, etc.

Another visually impaired singer plays the tabla, harmonium, keyboard and uses finger snaps to navigate a house he is new to, echo location that is.

Another visually impaired dancer, 100% blind, dances bharatanatyam so beautifully, you wont believe it.

2 other deaf and mute dancers are technologically so advanced they know every feature in the smartphone, I myself did not know these things existed in our smartphones.

The things they can achieve is incredible. Proud for you boys and girls. Well done!  In b4 mudi takes all credit There’s not even 1 mention of this in my fb feed. What the fuck is with people.  Those pictures are amazing. Immensely proud of every member of the team. These guys are the heroes of the country. Very impressive. Cheers to all the participants. Keep inspiring!! I'm an American living in India for work, and I had several of these athletes seated on a flight with me recently.  Little did I know I was in the presence of literal greatness.  Hats off to them, and congrats to OP for helping to shine a light on a news story that deserves way more coverage! Good job by the winners! Congrats!

I had posted a few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket, might hamper talented individuals pursue their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

So you mean that the private board BCCI - Board of Control for Cricket in India should invest in others sports? Yeah.. And the worst part is that other than a few blogs most of the big websites are busy in promoting and advertising ipl than this massive achievement This is amazing! We need more good news like this in this shitty political climate. I just screenshoted this news and shared it to all social media platform I am part of. 

I hope at least some of them gain awareness because of this.  Meh. India does really bad at real olympics, so they satisfy themselves with these little competitions. It’s a shame really that India performs so poorly on olympics. Anyway, congrats to the athletes that got gold, and hope they work harder to get real Olympic gold! I'm all for being proud of participation in the Special Olympics, but the nature of the event suggests that being proud of medal counts is a bit inappropriate.  It's not intended to be a serious competition, it's a serious attempt to include people.  Be proud of being inclusive, and leave out counting medals guys.  :-)

ParaOlympics are more serious competition, but Special Olympics creates a category for every class of disability, to create a level playing field.  The result is a vast number of medals awarded in a large number of yearly events.  Don't get into counting, it is a no-win behavior that demeans the whole enterprise. The question is why don't we have the same kind of performance in the other Olympics Couldn't find any link of medal count of different countries and what's India position ? India is such a bizzare outlier....

Regular olympics (every nation cares except india) - shit show, near zero medals

“special” Olympics (nobody else really cares) : good show, plenty medals

Boggles the mind I wish Modi would speak about this achievement on television and highlight our nation’s victory, but likely to busy figuring out a way to bomb Pakistan so he can stay elected.

Hopefully Nathhulal was from upper caste.

I've been telling people that we've been one of the most casteist states in India. It just that most vocal group of us are rich so our shortcomings aren't surfaced yet. 
 Kuch din to guzariye Gujarat mein. Caste is never going to vanish from India. I suggest we stop putting our last names from our school certificates onwards till later in life. Let them keep guessing what caste,creed or family you were born in.  Arey bc! Gujarat me Gu kar diya.  Fuck Gujarat. The fuck is wrong with a fucking moustache? This caste bullshit needs to stop. How primitive can you get? Gujarat Dalits need to learn from the Dalits of Punjab. Be assertive, be ready to fight. Don't expect justice from people who live to oppress you.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**Dalit youth beaten up for sporting a moustache - Times of India** 

 ______ 
AHMEDABAD: Merely 15km from the state capital, Gandhinagar , a dalit youth was beaten up by some upper caste people allegedly for sporting a moustache!Three persons from the darbar community allegedly abused and assaulted Piyush Parmar (24), the youth from Limbodara village in Kalol taluka of Gandhinagar district, on September 25 because the members from the dominant community did not like the idea of a dalit youth sporting a moustache.Police lodged a complaint under the atrocities act against the trio from the same village, identified as Mayursinh Vaghela, Rahul Vikramsinh Serathia and Ajitsinh Vaghela, on September 26. The case is being probed by a DySP level officer.According to the FIR, Parmar, who works with a private firm in Gandhinagar, and his cousin Digant Maheria were returning to their home after enjoying garba at their village when some people started hurling casteist abuses at them.""As it was dark, we could not see them. When we went near the place from where the voice was coming, we found three members of the darbar community there. Just to avoid any scuffle, we ignored them. As we reached our house, the darbars came to our house and started abusing us again. They first assaulted my cousin Digant and then started beating me, repeatedly asking me how can you sport a moustache despite coming from a lower caste community,"" Parmar told TOI.An FIR has been registered in this connection by the Kalol police under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with an intent to provoke breach of peace), and 114 (abetment), besides the atrocities act.The FIR reads, ""The accused in the case have committed the offence of abusing, beating and asking the complainant how can he sport a moustache.""

With modernisation and globalisation the dynamics of caste should have been reduced, rather what we see is it's overt expressions. Like why the fuck many need to show shitty rajput insignia on their cars.  Question from UK Indian/Guju - how do you find out if your caste is high or low?  

This is totally fucked up.  On another level.  How the fuck can you even tell by looking at someone what caste they are?

Is Gujarat more backward than other states?  

The gujus I meet tend to have entrenched ideas when it comes to culture. Caste has not gone. If anyone criticizes caste system, they will say caste will go away naturally. I never thought anyone will beat up someone for a mustache !! Wtf is wrong with us man *Yeh kya bakchodi hai?* And this is what unemployed kids do with all their free time. Beat up a Dalit kid for a fucking moustache. Fuck. Fascism This surely looks like Poll Gimmick (Incident is real but it seems motivated to stir the Dalit agenda) ...ofcourse we are one of the casteist... but nobody gives fuck about your  moustache... FYI i am from town and living in Ahmedabad  I would give up moustache for virtually guaranteed IIT+IIM seat He doesn't particularly look like a ""dalit"". Or atleast how some Indians think of ""dalits"". All I see is another Indian. Not sure why the courts don't give the option for dalits to change their name so as to not have to identify as one.

Living in the U.S. I forget how easy it is for someone to just change their name and start a new identity in another part of the country. You can't change everything of course but there was a time in America's history where even that was possible. Probably was one of the reasons why it was so appealing to early settlers.

India really needs to look into how dalits in one region of the country can succeed as normal caste members in another region/state.",2017-09-29 14:35:22
Sports,"WATCH: ""Leave India if you like foreign batsmen more than Indians,"" Virat Kohli replies to a fan",298,9uxxl1,https://circleofcricket.com/category/social_scoop/29171/watch-leave-india-if-you-like-foreign-batsmen-more-than-indians-virat-kohli-replies-to-a-fan,270,,rahulthewall," Anyone playing cricket should be asked to leave India as it was invented by the colonial masters Kohli: ""Honey, dinner's ready."" 

Anushka: ""mm, its nice but next time I wanna go to my favorite Italian restaurant.""

Kohli: ""I don't think you should live in India. Go and live in Italy. Why are you living in our country and loving other countries? I don't mind you not liking my food but I don't think you should live in our country and like other's thing. Get your priorities sorted.""   His inner bhakt surfaces. Khud shaadi baahar ja kar ki thi, wahi reh jaaye.

Not that I think like that, but I am applying his argument to him. This leave if you don't like something argument is pure retarted. Why is this argument so popular? I don't like foreign batsmen nor Indian ones, but if you are paying for my tickets and visa then I'll say that I like foreign batsmen more than Indians. Get me moving now! BTW I like New Zealand batsmen better just so you know where to send me. Fortunately that fan didn't say that he likes to see Pakistani batsmen in action. Otherwise he would have celebrated this Diwali in Pakistan. Nice political play there kohli. Polarize first! Address the issue later. How I wish this was fake. Is bhenchod ke liye jo zaraa sa  respect tha, woh bhi nahi rahega bahut jald. At least sehwag showed his colours *after* his career over, yeh to abhi shuru ho gaya.  This is a statement of inadequacy from a batsman who has it all to become a legend of the game  Sir but i have a Aadhaar card. [deleted] By his logic he should - Sponsor only indian brands, leave India if you sponsor uber, nike, nestle, puma. Set your priorities right Virat. Ponting was my favourite batsman, Sachin was third most favourite, Dada being second.  kek! help me with visa, travel and settling in the new land. Although I like indian batsmen but I am ready to settle abroad. This comment section, twitter outrage shows why India will never have any show like Colbert, Bill Maher, John Oliver or any political comedy show. It you read the article it says he was responding to mean comments, like ""mean tweets"". If you think he would risk millions of $s of contracts, you need to think again. His response was really bad, the response should be 5-6 words max and shouldn't need to be explained. I feel like that comment might be fake, it sounds very condescending, ""these Indians"" I mean WTF. Also don't think anyone would describe Kohli as ""overrated batsman. Nothing seems special in his batting."" Kohli is the one of the few batsmen that is succeeding at all format.  Seemed kinda like those Jimmy kimmel mean tweet  thing people really need to loosen up these days.kohli isn’t known for his wit seemed like a poor joke nothing more nothing less. Top meme material right here. Cricketers shouldn't even joke these days because people will find some reason to get offended. This too with Kohli whose favorite batsman is probably ABD. Looks like most ppl didn't even watch the video to get the context. No wonder media can polarise people with their headlines. Its deeply upsetting.This is why we can't have nice things. Have hordes of ultra regressive conservative people in the country is bad enough. Just wake up and understand the context before you get all hyper and start hating the guy who is most likely more liberal than you. Idiots.. Comment taken out of context. 

Could have handled it better, yes. But it is not that big a deal it is made out to be. I hate it when people who have never watched sports in their lives start talking shit about players because of a random misinformed bias. He said in mockering way. He is kind of person who replies with BC to his bully while hugs to his friend. The questioner asked cringy question and the inner Delhi boi of kohli activated. That's it. Nothing else to discuss. This is ridiculously poor by Kohli. I thought Kohli of 2018 had matured in to a sensible stand up guy.  Any sport transcends nationalities and it's perfectly alright to have idols from other nationalities. How many kids growing up had their idols as Gilchrist, ABD, Sachin, Shane Warne, Mcgrath etc. That has nothing to do with nationality. Just shows is Kohli's mentality in a very poor light. This guy is such a dumb snobby arrogant bhakt! He thought Demonetization was the greatest political move ever.

Now he is asking people to leave India. This guy will be the CM of UP after fake Yogi becomes PM.


> ""For me, it's the greatest move that I've seen in the history of Indian politics, by far. I've been so impressed by it, it's unbelievable what has happened,"" Kohli said at the pre-match press conference. Source: https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/virat-kohli-demonetisation-india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-352256-2016-11-16 This despite the fact that he knows that there are so many AB fans in India and he has acknowledged this fact himself so many times.
I think this was his brainfade moment. Unsure about the authenticity of the video. If it's real though, I find it hilarious he said that, especially since he didn't get married in India. Same logic hold true, no? Kohli's chaddi is showing. First deploying [Gautam Gambhir and MS Dhoni as the face of BJP](https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/ms-dhoni-gautam-gambhir-likely-to-contest-on-bjp-ticket-in-2019-lok-sabha-elections-report/302547). Next, [removing high protein food like beef from the cricketer's menu](https://newsd.in/bcci-asks-cricket-australia-to-remove-beef-from-indias-menu/).

And now naming non-supporters as anti-Indians.

RSS wants to use the soft power of cricket to influence millions of Indians to abhor people who eat beef or non-supporters as anti-Indians, further creating divisive lines in our country and to push their own communal agenda.

I won't be surprised if in future Muslim players like Shami and Khaleel Ahmed get dropped from the Indian Cricket Team all Indians should leave India The beauty of any sports is the fact it transcends all barriers and binds people together in a common thread. Jingoism should have no place in it. I am a Virat Kohli fan because of his hard work and attitude but this shit is ridiculous.  I don't like any batsman,  i just hate virat koli. Does this mean i can stay?  I remember him using a stool to stand next to a tall female sportsperson. While undoubtedly a brilliant cricketer, not the brightest of bulbs otherwise.

We’d do better as a race if we follow people who are actually serving society than being insanely good at hitting a ball. I wonder what he has to say about the thousands of desi expat fans who come to see him and the Indian team play in the UK/Australia/other countries. Haha... Kohli should watch mean tweets. The Vedas say that all true Indians should believe India is the best at everything. Those who don't should go to Pakistan. I like lara more than anyone , I like Denis lily as bowler than anyone else.
 [Very relevant.](http://imgur.com/gallery/uwMGKtk) Lol reactions here are over the top to something taken out of context. I always wonder with guys like this if they believe that Indians still cheering for Indian sportsmen/women while living in America should come back to India? I am shocked and mind-blown that a progressive intellectual like Kohli has said this. Pfft. Fucking wanker. Intellect inversely proportional to batting skills....Indians have the habit of making gods of celebs, and to an extent then some will even try to justify their stupid remarks. Lol. Kiddo got offended  Why all of sudden he sounds like a BJP person ? He recently tweeted about his partnership with Tissot and he is their brand ambassador. Someone should tell him that if he prefers a foreign brand over Ajanta watches then he should leave India The country's been bhakt-up.  What else did you all expect from a modi fan. First, see the video and listen to the way he's speaking and then post such stuff. Don't make it look out more than what it is. Blowing things out of proportion. Are gusse me boldiya Kohli paaji ne. Har cheese Dil pe lene ki zarurat nahi. Ab dilli ke punjabi chokre apne logic ke like thodi jaane jaate Hain. Happy Cake Day a-manyavar. So if there is a match in India between 2 foreign countries, whom do we support? Flashback, it's 1942 all over again :p The BC intervention seems to have worked though Now I get it why we need Dhoni behind the stumps when he is captaining the side... So after Sehwag and Dhoni, Kohli preparing for a BJP ticket too? This man still doesn't have 'control over his mouth' at the big age of 30 sadly. The Australian media had a lovely time due to this during their test series here in 2017. Typical TDC. This arrogant prick is Indian cricket's Modi. OP’s user name makes sense.

Virat Kohli, you Sir are an idiot. He is becoming too arrogant ,if this is his statement Taken out of context, the 'Fan' pretty much called the Greatest Batsman at the moment overrated and then said that he'd rather watch Australians or English than 'these' Indians. Lol, definitely deserved what he got as a reply.  Kohli only says this because he knows Smith is the true test chad Ok. Deal. Give me money to emigrate and i'm off to Australia for life. Tere baap ka hai kya india? chutiye His tone sounds very different in text and in video, but nevertheless that's a very stupid thing to say. Thought his PR team would have told him to handle it better and say the right things. Where cricket is the definition of patriotism.  One thing we need to learn is that good actors/artists/authors/sportsmen can be absolute rubbish humam beings. And it's fine. They don't owe anyone anything. They should be known for their craft and that's that.  I really live him as a cricketer, he has actually worked very hard and used his natural talent to be at zenith of the cricket. But this is an absolute rubbish reaction, you should only like Indian things otherwise you should leave the country!! Really who choose a foreign country for his marriage celebration, has sponsorship deals with multiple foreign brands like Puma, Audi, Tissot, Col-Pal more. 😶 Never liked him and his smugface. And, I love Cricket. The most shameful disgustingly highest run scorer who has shitty personality in India as a sportsman. Infact he is no sportsman at all.  Virat Kohli for all his glories as a batsman is a short tampered goon.

I don't like him at all. He is by far the worst person to be a captain of any team. It is clearly evedent that how he is a proper failure WITH RCB when he doesn't get the same guidance on how to run a team.  Waah. Those who endorse foreign brands like puma and oppo should leave also Replace"" batsmen"" with ""pornstars"" and read again.  Ah, I was wondering when the ""Delhi"" in him would start to show. About time.  What an utterly douchenozzley response from Kohli. Don't know what the guy he responded to meant by 'these Indians' though.  Virat Kohli : [*""Demonetisation is greatest move in history of Indian politics, says Virat Kohli""*](https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/demonetisation-is-greatest-ever-move-in-history-of-indian-politics-virat-kohli-4378322/) Batsmen outside, chutiya inside.  I don't think he meant that as is. Even I was slightly irked by that person's choice of words - as if he was trying to irritate Kohli deliberately. Notice that the person used words like English, Australian, rather than pointing out what actually they found in them other country players that ""Indian"" players were lacking,rather than them being Indian. 

Although Virat could've answered more clearly, I don't think it's his fault that he replied in such a manner.  Cricket is a pathetic, boring colonial game and such cringe does not help its case.

Someone needs to stop this overhyped crap sport from discrediting potential for other sports in this country already. He can go fuck himself.  Again this retard with his verbal diarrhea.  I think this is just a knee jerk reaction to criticism from a sportsman who has dedicated his life to the game. No one expects a leader of the sport to say something like this, but maybe just Kohli's immaturity in handling unexpected statements. Hopefully, he can work on it and improve. I liked this guy though i dont follow cricket anymore. Didnt know Kohli was a first grade cunt. Dilli ka chhora hai. Mean comments ko pyaar se reply nahi karega. Responding sledging with sledging. Videshi cricketers know it very well, now indian critics too.

Proud of you Kohli! Feels like most people don't get sarcasm nor do they have a sense of humour. Cricketers who have a political opinion like Kolhi, Sehwag, Gambhir should be arrested.  What does ""these Indians"" mean  Get a batting average like Don Bradman. Then tell other Indians to leave India I don't even like cricket. I think it's stupid. What should I do?

I love how he reads a comment on the internet and thinks that he should now weigh in as to what the person should do with his life. 

It wasn't even that bad a comment. Looks like we have a snowflake here. 

&#x200B;

Edit: Afterthought So, it comes to pass: After the politicians, babas and VCs, an entertainer is educating Indians about this 'art of nationalism'. I don't even watch or have slight interest in cricket. Where should I go 🤔 Anushke "" Leave me if you jerk off to Sunny Leone"" Shaadi kahe India me  ahi ki fir? [deleted] Never ever feed a troll. Only a troll would call Kohli overrated. And ""these Indians”, what's that supposed to mean. He is a passionate Indian cricketer, 
 who got pissed and reacted in anger, so what? So narrow this guy is, Indians should like him but his fans can't kiss him.

Saava sou karod between the edges...
Thoda aadjeyst karlo bhai! Fuck this guy....why can't you admire and like another batsman even if you live and are an Indian.   It's a game you chutia not a war your a sports person not a soldier, you my man have issues.   

Ja Anushka ka loda chuss to shayad koi buddi ayegi.... fuckwad. Bharat Ratna for Kohli is now confirmed Any other source on this? Next time if any organisation thinks to make kohli an ambassador of a noble cause it should think hundreds of time. Sports are always considered containing some force of unity or togetherness. It follows that representative of a sport should never be unmindful of his duties. By advocating popular and rabid form of nationalism kohli has done huge disservice.
P.S. Now we should not expect from cricket to heal our relationship with a certain neighbour. ""He is overated"" This statement is enough to prove that his comment is worth ignoring. No need to respond",2018-11-07 17:12:28

whats going on ?",xenomorph2010," Haryana does well. Participates in every sport other than Cricket. Money. Money. Money.

For the media. For the manufacturer. For the advertisement agencies. Well we have been doing pretty decent in Badminton.

Kidambi Srikanth, PV sindu, Saina Nehwal are all highly ranked badminton players  Cricket is a glamorous affair which has pan-india appeal. Part of it is due to media's insistent glamorous tone of their personal lives.                  
Just like Bollywood, cricket also enjoys that masala bling factor, so it has a much greater appeal. Which in turn makes cricket a lucrative business model just like Bollywood. No matter how much you hate Bollywood or cricket, TOI's boobs and virushka will pull you right into it. Other sports don't enjoy that kind of media attention, that's why different sports have their popularity enclosed in different states.           
 Virat Kohli has spent around 34 crores(**?**) for his wedding in Italy. Make other sports as lucrative as cricket, you'll get more attention for sure. That billion number is misleading. You need to count people who really have time and access to the sport.             
But once you have access and good enough to be identified as a talent there are avenues to refine your skill.  For example I met a guy who is an assistant coach for baseball team for MP. He seemed to be doing well for himself money wise from the salary and was pursuing a post grad course in sports science. And That’s for a fairly obscure 
sports in India.               
At least now India is in top tier in several sports other than Cricket.  Which is a good progress.  this is where i say betting should be legalised for all non-cricketing sports.

yes, have safeguards (max bet limit 3k, bet only after KYC sign-off, etc.) - but give the public something to be interested in.

that's the first step. the more people are interested, the higher the ad revenues go up for the sport. this leads to better training facilities, better skills and player health, and ultimately a reason to watch the sport without betting on it.

of course, this will be difficult to implement for individual sports without the F-word rearing its head. Other sports aren't as successful because of lack of following. There is another thread that talks about football having support but that is not true at all. Sports will gain support only when people see success. Take the rise of cricket for example. Before 1983, people barely followed cricket. From 1983 and 1985, India saw huge success in the sport and that captivated people's attention. Then Sachin came into the scene and his gameplay was praised by everyone making people more interested in the game. Even badminton today is following in the same footsteps. Continuous success of Indians in the sport is getting more people interested in the sport. The only way any of the other sports will develop is in the same way. People want to see success. You should have been at Bhubaneswar during the Asian Athletics Championship and the recently concluded Hockey World League > 1.3 B people yet the number of medals are ridiculously low whats going on ?

And that is a problem because? You think?

There is no money to be made in other sports like there is in cricket. The govt neither supports the players before they win medals or trophies in other sports and casts them aside and leaves them to fend for themselves after. Most of these sportsmen end up destitute. Being an international level sportsperson isn't a hooby on the side. It is a career choice and a commitment for life. With no chances of actually being able to sustain even 3 time meals in the career of other sports, why would anyone want to take it?

All the investment is by the athlete. They have to risk everything on their own terms to get to an international platform and they don't get much in return. You have to provide training options and good career prospects - like a steady reasonably paying job coaching more people - after they achieve something.  I don't participate in any sport so that's that. You think? The other games are not lucrative enough. If the people are not watching you won't get advertisements. If we want medals, the population should start watching other sports. Yeah I don't enjoy other sports so I don't play/watch them. Most of the other sports are not good options for career & cricket has done well to maintain its popularity. No shit, Sherlock Just compare the medals with china they are doing much better than us :

Sports,My ex-company(a giant MNC) wants me to pay notice period recovery amount even when I didn't propose the last working day.,68,c7njxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c7njxm/my_excompanya_giant_mnc_wants_me_to_pay_notice/,44,"TLDR/I quit my desk job, since I want to pursue adventure sport of paragliding as a living.I resigned, Manager accepted & he proposed a relieving date - all on email.The company wants me to pay notice period shortfall.

I absolutely do NOT want to pay the notice period shortfall.

**How do I go about this?**

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is indeed long, but please read through for details-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sequence of events in summary:

1. I resigned (official email date 1st January 2019), requested a relieving date from my Manager.
2. My Manager confirmed resignation acceptance & **he proposed the last working day as 28th February 2019**, on email (HR in copy).
3. Per discussion with the Manager, I completed my handover of projects/documentation. I complete last work day formalities & wait for full and final settlement.
4. On March 25th, HR tells me I have to pay a notice period shortfall waiver of 1 month. (citing notice period in contract being 3 months & I have served 2 months )
5. I try to explain, that the date was NOT proposed by me. I followed notice period as advised by the manager & as discussed between me & the manager.
6. They say - Whatever is written in contract takes precedence. Moreover HR cites that the Manager did not explicitly mention in email that the notice period is waived off. I have to pay if I have to clear the dues for the retirals to be processed.
7. Furthermore, HR says this matter is upto discretion of the management ( Management = Centre head of the premises I worked at)
8. My manager is spineless, but I have brought in level-up manager (American) in the communication chain & I would be meeting the centre head in about 9-10 days. (he is out of India right now)

\---

&#x200B;

I have worked for the company for past 6 years. (Out of total 11 years of my total work experience)The company is an Indian division of a giant European MNC.

About a decade ago, the Indian division was mostly a manufacturing facility in Gujarat.

Our centre head is someone who is a veteran from that setup & mostly runs the centre basis same factory-driven-mindset, with loads of hierarchy & ""well set"" grooves and ""network"" of managers.  
That is not how the MNC functions outside India, but the P&L centre shows profit every year, so I guess the counterparts don't interfere.

Since I received the ""Notice period shortfall recovery email"" from HR in March 2019, I have been escalating the issue & seeking a waiver on it, since it was not my suggestion to have a 2 month notice period.

&#x200B;

HR Manager's manager had this overall input ""It is a *small* amount.. You should part ways on good note..""

The HR manager's manager borderline threatened me for the escalation with

""Do you want us to tell **this** when we get a call for background check anytime in the future?""

&#x200B;

He also mentioned, that this is the process they follow & ultimate discretion lies with management now.

So, I figured, it is pointless talking to him.*I did some digging and there was this IT/Systems in charge fellow who resigned recently. He served the notice period & for whatever reason, his manager let him go 2 days earlier, that too with a record on email.Still, he was asked to pay 2 days worth of notice period recovery amount, before his dues were cleared!!He paid it up since he was supposed to leave abroad for his next job & it was a small amount which he didn't want to hold up the larger settlement dues over that.*

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It simply blows my mind, that a company like such is actually hell bent on making money off notice period shortfalls, especially where the parting is mutual & hasn't even caused any business harm/loss or lack of transfer of work.

I absolutely do **NOT** want to pay the notice period shortfall.**How do I go about this?**

I was thinking about:

1. Writing to the ombudsperson (reporting helpline for intercompany disputes) - to get some global heat in this.
2. Writing about this to as many functional head & Global HR email addresses I can gather to just get this escalated so much, that it cannot be just pressed down.
3. Getting lawyer's opinion on this. (I would really like to avoid any legal proceeding, since that would call for a lot of work, time, money!)

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More details about communication/ Company structure/history/ in 1st comment.",do_mech," 1. I don’t believe you’re liable to pay anything to the company, because your reporting manager was the one who provided the date for the termination of the contract.

2. If the HR manager is threatening to ‘reveal’ this in a background check, please inform him/her that doing so would be seen as an offence under IPC sections 499 and 500. Additionally, IPC 383 may also be applicable. Please check with a lawyer.

IMO, this is just a scare tactic to get you to pay

3. The company mentioned that it is a small amount. In that case they should be able to waive it.

4. Write an anonymous review of the company on Glassdoor. That should be sufficient warning for all current and future employees. [deleted] spam the management with polite complaints, someone in the ladder who has important things to do will waive this to make the 'insignificant' problem go away so that he can focus on his real job. idiotic HR just needs a word from top until then they will think they are the boss. > I want to pursue adventure sport of paragliding as a living.

I have been discussing about a 1 year sabbatical since last March. That was not possible for my role, according to the Manager & the level-up Manager.

I also tried to check work-from-home / away possibility which was not pushed enough by my Manager either.

I then did inform them, last November about my intent to resign.

  
**Company structure/history/current**

I worked with a US based MNC (for 3 years). That was taken-over / merged with the European MNC giant.

The HR structure, the centre head (for Gujarat factory) we are talking about is the US-based-MNC structure.

Even through past 3 years, we have not yet completely gone on board of the Europe based company structure. So, it's kinda complex.

I still have the option to write to the Europe-based-structure HR chain / counterparts, but I doubt if they will have any say here.

  
**The Notice period recovery flag**  
The email communication shows my resignation & Manager-proposed date - being 2 months apart. No notice period was mentioned on the email by me or Manager, or the HRs in copy.  
The clearance process form does have a HR field which needs their input on Notice period/dues/others.  
The HR was not available the day of my relieving. The fields were not filled in earlier, either by them.

So, it turns out, this notice period is not flagged until, it is actually time for the Employee to pay it.  


**Rationale?** 

I tried my best to reason out, that the handover etc was done in order. My leaving 1 month sooner than the contract has not resulted in any business harm/loss, no process disruption. So, what is the ratinale for the recovery amount?  
Obviously, there was no answer to that. IANAL, but here is my view.

&#x200B;

1. If your manager proposed a LWD and you accepted it, it is binding. He does not have to explicitly say 'notice period is waived off'. The LWD means you are not supposed to be working after that date, and it can clearly be construed as the notice period being waived off. Please check your contract - I am sure there is a provision for the notice period getting shortened on mutual agreement between the employee and the company.
2. A bad reference is an empty threat. It opens up the company to a lot of legal problems. Unless the HR is crazy, they will not give you a bad reference.

3.    Any company worth its salt can write this off as a cost of doing business. 

&#x200B;

As long as you have the mail with the LWD, you should be good. It seems like the company is covering up for your manager's spinelessness.

&#x200B;

Please name and shame this company. Op I'm a lawyer. Have dealt with these kind of cases before. Send them a legal notice through a lawyer. You are absolutely correct in your assessment that you're not liable to pay anything. However, despite your stance being correct, pursuing a legal option will be rather long drawn and expensive for you. Rather I would suggest escalating the matter to your superiors and also the main head office (globally, not India). Take a strong stance and don't back down. Do loop in senior members/directors/managers who you have worked with in the past. They usually have the power to influence HR decisions. 

If nothing works, within 1-2 months, you can send them a legal notice. (This should be used as a scare tactic rather than as a predecessor to actual litigation, which you should try to avoid). Whether it is American or European company they had to still abide by the local laws (American or European working laws).

Just saying France passed a law that Manager cannot contact employee during weekend. 
There is mandatory labour working hours 37.5 hours / week. Your hours increases more than that then the company should have gotten a pre consent or part of contract.

My point is you can find number of times the company breached the contract terms . Both local and international.labour laws. You can state since company breached it's contract you are no longer bound to honour the contract The same thing happened to me when I left Accenture. I was relieved earlier and had to pay nothing extra. Go through the contract and see all the details. You got the final settlement / relieving paperwork that shows you have no dues.

Get most of the communication in emails.

If required ask the HR to involve the legal department. This makes the HR act cocky and realize that it can harm their reputation more than the employee’s. I don't have much idea about this, but I might end up in your situation soon so please keep us posted with all details.

But whatever don't pay them. There should be a ban on demanding money from employees for quitting. I mean, WTF, if there is a 3 month notice period then the company should be responsible for making sure you work 3 months and there should be an entitlement to withhold severance pay until the full notice period is served. Someone in HR screwed up and they are trying to pin it on you. I don't think you are liable to pay anything but I trust whoever is cheap enough to pull this stunt (looks like it is the HR manager) will also be cheap enough to hold a grudge. What happens if you say, I'll stay for the full 3 months ?
Does that impact you in any way? I was in the same boat a year ago when I stopped attending my MNC job and company asked me to pay money for my notice period.
I never went to them asking for anything. don't care about them See the company would try to scare you with these kinds of consequences, but since you are changing your profession entirely it doesn't matter.

The company would refrain from legally enforcing the payment ( probably 1 day's lawyers charges might be more than your pending amount).

The only way for the company to enforce is that they will not issue exp letter unless all dues are cleared. If you don't want exp letter you can say bye-bye without worries. Afaik, these threats doesn't stand chance in legal course. If it is IT, majority of laws are as per US norms. You can leave without thinking much. Contracts can be modified afterwards as well. You can point out the instances of working hours and how you stayed back to work, for instance.

&#x200B;

Most importantly, just walk away man. The lawyers' fees is more expensive for the company.",2019-07-01 11:30:36
Sports,People of R/India. Let’s talk about Narcissistic personality disorder and abusive relationships. I have put my experience here. Would like know other people experiences and how things went and how they recovered.,67,c3otkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c3otkm/people_of_rindia_lets_talk_about_narcissistic/,57,"  

A few months back I had posted a question on r/India to seek people’s opinions on their experience with broken engagement if they had any. In the post, I had mentioned my experiences of what happened in vague. 

Putting things in perspective, my engagement ended simply because I shared my past struggles and future career ambitions with my ‘to be wife’/fiancée.  Struggles were in general related to a sports injury, past relationship, career decisions. My sole motivation to let her know about few from past was, first that I was being honest and wanted my ‘to be’ to know me in and out before marriage. Practically speaking, if we can’t discuss our weaknesses, struggles, insecurities with our SO then there is definitely something wrong with the relationship.

Anyway, on my previous post, many people had replied. Most said that I had dodged a bullet while few held me responsible for whatever happened.

Now coming to present, I do have my closure. Moved on to better things in life. But the days and months post the breaking of engagement were really really horrible. A nightmare that I wish no one should go through.

What I realized after almost 5 months that I went through was Narcissistic Abuse. All the time I was suffering thinking that something is wrong with me and I am responsible for all the events. But it was the girl, my fiancée, she was a covert narcissist. They are the worst kind of human to ever stay in this world. This inference is not by me but by psychologists. Almost 4-5 months after the ending of engagement one day when I was simply browsing over the internet about abusive relationship, a word popped up, narcissism. It just struck me like a big slap on my face. The realisation came that what I went through were ditto 100 % match to what someone endures in a narcissistic relationship.  

A brief account of what happened pre and post engagement. 

It was simple case of arranged Indian marriage. Girl’s family were too keen for marriage. Initially girl presented her as very charming and was very acceptable with our match. Only issue with her was to take things slowly. I asked her why she is marrying me, she said I am honest mature etc etc and I have everything she wants in a prospective partner. Also, she wants to continue job, can’t cook, want to go office party and booze, support her parents financially, etc. I was cool with everything. I will even support your parents since now they are my parent too. 

But suddenly, after 2-3 weeks, slowly things changed. She slowly started avoiding any communication, started telling lies, blatant manipulation, showed controlling behaviour, became very passive aggressive. She would just give silent treatment out of nowhere. We were supposed to go together from our work city to our home town, get engaged next day and be back. During the whole journey, 6-7 hrs one side, she just did not talked to me. Just acted as if I have committed some crime. When I asked what’s wrong, she said everything is fine, I am just over reacting. She acted totally normal in front of other.

In the end, I knew something is wrong. I asked parents from both side to meet to sort our issue. Here is what she said or did. She said, I worry a lot, I take too much tension, I am a mamma’s boy, I work in a govt sector but she want someone in IT, I am 4 years older than her and wants someone of her age, I am immature, I am not fun, I am a nerd etc etc. She used my past experiences to spin it around as real issues. She blamed me of still having affair with my ex and blamed me of having physical relationship in past, she said I have very low confidence. Her father questioned my confidence and how am I able to do a job with responsibility. Her mother told that her daughter will love me after marriage if I make her feel safe. In the end, she compared me to a Karela (a very bitter vegetable which mostly no one likes) and said how can a karela be compared to mango.  She put a statement as her WA dp pointing towards me, “why so mean, coz I thought If I look unapproachable then you will not approach me”.

How I realised she was a narcissist. 

She herself has said she feels no emotions. Her twins bio, clearly mentions her as narcissistic. She was a master manipulator, pathological liar (I caught herself many number of times), had extreme abusive personality. Blamed my mother for scolding her but my mother never did. The classic stages of any narc relationship was there in my case too. Initial charm, then slow manipulation, torture for no reason at all and then final discard in which everything is blamed on you. I have undergone therapy after wards with couple of psychologist and psychiatrist. All of them pointed to issues with her mental state. Nothing was wrong with me, expect she had damaged me till the brinks of destruction. She said in the beginning that she has temper issues. People perceive her as having excessive attitude. She was extremely jealous of people. She never said anything good about her friends. She made sure, I don’t meet any one of her friend or colleague. She never shared anything deep about her although she asked everything from me. When I asked she would immediately change topics. There were many mind fukkary with her.  

Anyway I have moved on. The scars will always haunt me but the whole experience has actually changed me for the better. As for me, I know, I am pretty chill guy, quiet fun to be with, actually a real traveller, achieved a lot in my life, and also works as a “Gazetted Officer with GOI”. She works as some associate in some American bank in biryani city.  After her I went on a dating spree, met almost 5-6 girls. Many of them said one thing for sure, I have a very good heart, and I need to preserve it. 

Would like to know, if anyone had experienced narcissism (NPD) first-hand, what their experiences are. For all it is, a proper mental disorder and people having NPD are the epitome of soul destroying b@t@h.

TLDR: A first-hand experience about extreme abusive relationship in which the perpetrator was a covert narcissistic person.",tez_launda," I hear all these stories and I look at my wife and I just realize how fortunate I am I was best friends with people who had a distorted view about reality. Since I lived in hostel same as them it was impossible to steer off their radar. Those were the kind of people who never understood my own past struggles (abusive childhood, non existent friends, failed friendships), and it was to the point that I couldn't share anything without them interrupting and starting their own story. There were a lot of instances where I felt like why am I even in their company. I know it's not like being in a companionship with. But you know, where friendship is given importance in this era, I used to feel that they are not the kind of people I should be friends with. 

Their personalities started to grow on me. For them, being an introvert was a disease. Never got time for myself. I had stopped interacting with others. Plus their constant complaining was a big headache. They considered that the world works according to their mindset. And would still complain about how other people are idiots. Never once I saw them praising someone for their personality. It was either looks or marks. 

I love learning new languages, reading philosophical texts, debating about random af shit. They would stop me from expressing my thoughts about any topic. I felt at conflict a lot of times. 

It wasn't easy to get out of their company. What I ate, where I went, what I did were monitored. It was strange getting calls from them and not from my own parents. Staying in their company made impossible for me to even observe that I'm becoming emotionally weaker day by day. My physical health was going down. And the fact that they started blaming me about my 'anger' issues when in reality I was only exhibiting anger where a normal person would do. Friends should help you grow, help you get out of a bad phase. You reciprocate it too. It is not a one-way street where I helped them in their crisis and I couldn't feel satisfied from their 'help'. My mind was chaotic around them. One year of their fuckery was enough.

Initial charm, slow manipulation yada yada was all there. I had to fake a fight to get out of their company. Felt terrible after leaving them. Felt like I was the bad person for breaking their group (later on they got back together). Thought that I did something really bad to them. I went for counseling. I started to make new friends. Kept my distance from the new friends. Learnt about narc behavior online. I don't remember crying that much over an online article. Every single thing written there was a spot on. The fact that outsiders perceived them likable on the basis of how they acted outside. 

OP, did you start copying her behavior, or maybe start legitimizing her actions as normal without considering that in real world, it's toxic as hell? Because I did that. Kitna time laga ye sab likhne mei u/tez_landa ? Honestly u were lucky. Imagine having to live with a person like that gosh

U should thank your lucky stars Its difficult to see that some people in comment section dont even acknowledge that NPD maybe a problem . And it's not their fault. Maybe they have not come in contact with someone having narcissistic personality. 
My very own brother has this type of personality. I have seen some bad shit in my childhood and growing up with him. No one is spared my friend. I agree with every point of yours. She was a narcissist. Maybe if you would have spent more time with her,she would turn out to be a sociopath. You never know. But narcissist people do exist and they hurt people around them and they are master manipulators.
You just have to realize that its not your fault >I work in a govt sector but she want someone in IT

What the fuck lmao

How and why is this a preferance [deleted] Not denying that she was a narcissist, NPD should probably be the national mental illness of India, but I fail to understand what kind of relationship were you trying to build with a stranger? Because your parents and her parents put their stamp of approval on it? That's it? How do you expect that to work? If not NPD your personalities could be completely opposite. This is the problem with the culture of arranged marriage, narcissistic elders arranging and facilitating a relationship for their narcissistic children (don't mean you) ... 

In my view you're wrong in expecting a ready made relationship with a stranger because your parents said so. Relatable. It was 4 years for me. Got outvery painfully. Life went in a downward spiral after the break up. 6 years on, could bring myself to let anybody in again. Only one thing I want to say is some people do like karela ;) r/foundthemobileuser ?? Thank you for taking the time to write this. So I wanted to know that if these people are hard to identify straight away is there a feasible defense mechanism. Would taking your time before forming your opinion on people work and to always be cautious to not trust some fully until you know them very very well. OP this was a brave move from you, opening up about this in Indian subreddit. Mental health and personality disorders are not given importance in our country. There is a lot of taboo around the concept of taking therapy. I can never understand as to why people think it is ok to be dysfunctional and cause harm to others and at the same time feel the need to laugh at those who try to better themselves by seeking help. This is probably gonna get buried but anyway, I think my mom might be narcissistic.

Anytime I would get ill, she would get very frustrated, felt like she was annoyed at how much more work it would take for her. She would get very angry and disappointed at me, if I ever got less than 38.5/40 marks because that meant my cousin might get I rank in that crappy school. She just constantly talks about how much work we kids are on her, how much work she has to do for us. Arranging birthdays was big chore for her and she would remind us anytime she did something for me about how much of a favor it was. She wouldn't care about anything I do other than my marks. 

She would arbitrarily not let me buy cheap stuff and would say ""earn your own money"". She used to hit me a lot when I was younger, when dad would ask why am I crying. she would tell completely downplayed version of her side. She would just say ""don't cry like a girl. Look how stupid you look while crying.""  

She constantly tells about how good she is at managing her work, home chores. She would tell almost everytime someone would recognize her when she went outside. She would tell how all those people in town are her enemies cuz they are jealous of her/our family/money. She would use me in her fights with dad saying ""if you talk to him, I ll go jump in the well"". Whenever she is wrong, she would tell straight up lies and blame others for her mistakes and never budge.

I got very heavily depressed and my studies went to hell. She would daily remind me how useless I am, how much better other kids are doing. That kind of made my condition worse and worse. She used to say, Me and you should both drink posion because you are useless anyway, started making jokes like ""watchout I might have put something in your juice"". I was overweight and started intermittent fasting and was losing ~4 kgs a month, I told her about my weight loss which was big mistake thinking back on it. She started saying you 'll get weak and thin. She started mixing butter in my food and forced me to eat tonic pills which would cause hunger. She wouldnt leave until I ate them and then wait for a minute or so more so i would be forced to swallow them. Thankfully, she forgot about that in 4-5 days. 

I am still recovering from it. Been suicidal, depressed, have ptsd while still living almost on her mercy. Sorry for the word salad. [deleted] Well written OP. I found about narcissist personality disorder the same way, after i ended a relationship. My ex narc's lack of empathy and sense of entitlement was astonishing. I pulled the plug first time she had a rage, fearing mental imbalance. And later realized almost ALL of her qualities matched what internet talks about NPD. The stare, subtle putdowns, princess syndrome, unapologetic, moving relationship very fast, blatant lies to the point of joke and the charming personality initially.

You dodged a major bullet. Arey bc bolna tha na aam nahi watermelon pasand hai mujhe. Aam to chuse hue nikle🤣 You should never reveal weakness and vulnerability in front of girls . They are natural manipulators and know exactly how to hurt you . In any case it seems like she didn’t wanted to get married to you and was forced by her family .",2019-06-22 19:52:47

Sports,Is it only me or many of you have lost interest in IPL?,67,b4m3qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4m3qf/is_it_only_me_or_many_of_you_have_lost_interest/,55,"I followed the IPL for the first 3 editions and then my interest got reduced to the Semi Finals and the Finals in the later editions. 

Maybe, cricket fatigue is a thing. ",_RandomRedditor," Cricket fatigue is definitely a thing, especially if your favourite team performs bad year after year.

I stopped watching Cricket after the loss in 2015 WC and the ban of CSK in 2015. I remember being too bored and tired of it.

I started watching Cricket again from last year's IPL and found myself enjoying it again. Last year's IPL was amazing. Its made all the more fun by participating in the live threads on r/Cricket. i am in with you. IPL is too much hype and the teams dont give a shit I hope it doesn’t tire them out before the World Cup. All Indian team players should take it easy and use the matches as practice. I agree, idk wtf happened to rcb.  Like everything in life. Bro I stopped watching cricket after 12 std. Got too bored. You have grown older, now you shoulder more responsibilities. IPL has started already? I'm not kidding. I seriously wasn't aware.  Yep. I miss the olden days of cricket. It's hard to stay interested if a month-and-half(?) long event that happens every year. The players keep hopping teams. BCCI adds and removes teams as it pleases. Nothing about the format inspires loyalty towards any team. The whole tournament is designed to squeeze out maximum number of matches.

But in general I stopped caring about cricket a while ago so that's definitely the biggest reason.  I lost interest after 2011.

It all started looking fake (for me) and all sugar coated stuff. Plus all the money that goes into it. Not sport but manufactured entertainment. Slowly losing interest cause my team keeps losing.  Not just you. I only watched the first edition of IPL out of novelty. Then I used to fake interest in order to fit in. Now I don't care. >I followed the IPL for the first 3 editions. 

Same here. I lost interest after 2011.

It all started looking fake (for me) and all sugar coated stuff. Plus all the money that goes into it. My interest has actually grown more than ever. :) so many matches. I can't even recall the name of team now. yep for first 2-3 seasons was good. 

But too many matches. I have stopped watching test n one day also. 

Only 20-20 n all world cups. I lost interest in IPL 2 itself I've lost interest in cricket. I don't even recognize some players in our current national team.

IPL is one of the reasons I lost interest.

Just too much cricket.  Give it a time. Its just first match. Few interesting matches and you'll be discussing/checking score every minute.  Stopped watching cricket after the college. Stopped following after Dravid retired. I lost interest after major players moved to different teams, so this was several years ato. The team's didn't mean anything to me anymore. Lost interest.  I watched the motobhai team documentary (I have a daily data quota and I intend to use  it to the full). Pretty boring but I was in suspense since I didn't know the result and was pleasantly surprised when the team was booted before the knock-off stages started. 

I'm just tangentially aware but it seems like either Dhoni's or Chowkidar Gambhirs team wins every year. I think even the more avid fans will be giving it a miss this time. The World Cup is just around the corner for Gods sake! Who the eff gives a flying eff for T20s right now! dream11 will bring back that ""interest""? :P They already play 370 days a year and now this IPL , one series ends n they leave for another . I am really bored to be honest. I don't watch cricket, never did. No interest in cricket. Sitting in front of the TV was not an option in school days and college life was too hectic. After college finished there's no time for tv. I like fishing, it is what me and Dad did in free time back in the day.  People who gave up Cricket after their team lost something were never fans of the game.  Yea. Like today's KKR match, and here I am, browsing reddit. Even two years ago, I would've been hooked to the screen. I havent watched cricket since dhoni won us the world cup I don't even know why Indians like cricket so much. There are other sports as well.  It's not just the IPL. It's cricket as a sport which has become dull and boring for me. As an Indian, I already feel the pride of knowing that my team is (arguably) the best in the world. But can we now move on and set bigger targets more appropriate for the second most populous nation? 

I can't seem to understand why everyone continues to ignore the fact that we are horrible at football, hockey, basketball, tennis and pretty much all major sports that have global participation. Isn't it extremely myopic to ignore our failure in producing world class athletes despite having a population of 1.3 billion, and continuously engage in this 6 nation circle-jerk that contemporary cricket has become?  Hello unkills You watched it for 1 season more then me.  I've lost interest in cricket itself. The last time i watched cricket was the 2011 world cup. Now I think cricket is just a waste of time. Cricket nowadays specially IPL has become like WWE nowadays, totally scripted. Sports is boring,same bullshit getting repeated again and again. Ipl is fixed PSL is the new IPL.

Is cricket locally as popular in any other country? Except India or the subcontinent? I mean there are teams from plenty countries, but is cricket actually popular in the streets or base level there?",mylackey," TLDR - No. 

Real answer - ICC isn’t really interesting in growing the game unless it can find $$$ there, which is why it’ll try to grow the game in the US but do jack shit for UAE despite being HQ’d in it 🤦‍♂️ I've been wondering the same thing. Currently in the US and there are a lot of British expats at work and none seem to be following cricket. I'm beginning to think that ever since the 2010s after India won the world cup, the game has become ""more South Asian"" for lack of a better phrase. Growing up in the 90s, it wasn't like this. British and Aussie cricketers were not just sports stars but we're also page 3 personalities. I don't think it is like that anymore. Does anyone remember Shane Warne and Liz Hurley? I believe there is a change in the demographic. As someone else mentioned in this thread, the Brits at work are actually more interested in the Women's soccer world cup than icc. I guess the grapes are sour? I would say outside the subcontinent cricket is a very 'niche' sport - it does have followers and some kids playing it, but not really big among the general pubic. Who gives a shit . Americans themselves don’t bother if their sports are popular elsewhere neither should we . Sub continent where a quarter of the world population follows it generates decent revenues for the ICC. Australia has proper cricket fans who aren't seasonal followers of the game #No I can tell that in the nordic regions, Cricket is pretty much a niche sport. There are a few clubs who play cricket but thats about it, the general public do not care about it. In the UK more people are following the Women's World Cup (soccer) than they are the cricket world cup.  Wimbeldon has started and so the CCWC is probably down to number 3 in terms of viewing figures.  In terms of general interest...it's niche. Nope, even Australia and England has stopped caring for it that much. Its become a niche sport outside of India.

And i believe the BCCI and ICC are responsible for it. Hasan Minhaj summaries it quite well in his [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5DWJv1hiwM)",2019-06-25 17:41:06
Sports,"TIL Polo in the modern form originated in Manipur, from where the British discovered and popularized the sport and now has spread as far as Europe, Canada, the United States, Latin America, and Australia.",15,9mdh9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9mdh9m/til_polo_in_the_modern_form_originated_in_manipur/,6,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo

>The modern game of polo is derived from Manipur, India, where the game was known as 'Sagol Kangjei', 'Kanjai-bazee', or 'Pulu'.[16][17] It was the anglicised form of the last, referring to the wooden ball that was used, which was adopted by the sport in its slow spread to the west. The first polo club was established in the town of Silchar in Assam, India, in 1833.

>The Mapal Kangjeibung, one of the oldest polo grounds of the world, in the heart of Imphal, Manipur

>Manipur believes it is the place from where polo originated. And so do Iran, Mongolia and China. Traditional records mention Sagol Kangjei, a Manipuri game which gave birth to modern polo. It was the Britishers who first took interest in the local game, played by the ethnic majority Meiteis. English officers who were stationed in the region formalised the game and took it to other countries. The popularity of the game is credited to one Lt. Joseph Ford Sherer, also called the 'father of modern polo'.",SirThighPiece," Being from Manipur, I'm pretty proud of this :)

Also, there's Sangai which is found only in Manipur and so is Siroi Lily. Look it up. I'm sure lots of people figured out the idea of hitting things around whilst on horseback but polo was being played in Iran *long long* before the British came along to India so they didn't spread it there",2018-10-08 17:48:18

Sports,"Swapna Burman, 6 toes in both legs, no money for special shoes. Father a rickshaw puller, mother working in a tea garden, running for her country in the final event of the Heptathlon with a bandaged jaw. And winning it for India This country certainly has no shortage of heroines",3537,9bfq9y,https://i.redd.it/rllf8nsa65j11.jpg,155,,boredmonk," Can't wait for Bollywood to make her biopic with Sonam Kapoor in the lead and fucking it up completely.  Source: Joy Bhattacharya on twitter. I was also born with twelve toes. This is where our similarities end.  Dayyyyum. Her arms are better than mine.  I am glad that non cricket sports are getting more and more female role models. One of india's biggest core problem is the gender gap in employment and this would encourage closing it.  I can't handle this. This is amazing... I saw a picture of a text book in West Bengal depicting Milkha Singh as Farhan Akhtar from Bhaag Milkha.
Times are changing in India. But they are too ducking slow. Time to honour the real heroes and patriots.
And stop helping Bollywood in creating utterly crap movies. For Ex: Sultan

Sultan doesn't show any training. Just that he falls in love and those athletes who are busting their ass since they were probably 5 yrs old are all defeated in 6 months? Dafuk?  Now I feel shitty for complaining about waking up and still being tired.. Truly inspiring.  [deleted] [This dude too](https://youtu.be/XaEGDS_curQ?t=3m5s). I was laughing at his rather unconventional throwing stances but he ended up demolishing his competition and won gold for India. Dude is like the Hulk.  Perfect example for ""what's your excuse?"" Might be mistaken but I think her name is Swapna Barman not Burman. 

Apparently the tape was used to help with a toothache in and infected tooth that flared up at the start of the competition. It was decided to try antibiotics rather than removing the tooth mid competition.  Look at that face. Look at that body language.

Iron clad determination!  How I see it is that India does not deserve such heroines when it cannot feed them or at least provide them with the infrastructure. It is ironic to say the least and very sad that to achieve basic standard of living is a quest for the common man in India. A hero the country needs right now, but not the one it deserves I think that is not inspiring but opposite of it. Telling everyone how our country doesn't care about any sports person no matter how badly they need help or caring intervention.. Our country sux. We all should be ashamed of ourselves.. This and many such truths just points to sorry conditions and diminishes all hopes for youth aspiring to excel in sports. OP , Hero should be gender neutral.
She is my Hero. India can't afford spl shoes for her? Poor country? But can afford to send her to Jakarta ? How? Congrats Swapna Burman for her great achievement even in a time when she was in great pain  first thing I see on reddit today - immediate goose bumps. well done. Very well done. No offence, but i legit thought that bandage was some sort of  Flag. Am i the only person who read the last word as heroine? I know this isn't the point and I am happy for her achievement and what it means for our nation, but she is really hot. Those arms! * swoon * Now that's a role model girls should be looking up to. Not fucking Karina Kaif and shit. India has enough money to feed an army of incompetent bureaucrats and politician-cronies to plum sports offices with first class international travel etc., but ACTUAL sportspeople and their families will live in poverty. The Sports Ministry expects impoverished people to win medals on their own grit, claims credit for when they actually do, and then goes back to its sarkari routine of incompetence, apathy, and neglect of actual sport.  If only we could treat our sportsman/ woman as we treat our cows, we could we winning Olympic medals by boatloads but knowing our government and its cronies hey would rather apply to make COW Safety a Olympics game rather. Daughters of India are making us proud big time. Hope they get good recognition and awards for their sacrifice None of the other nations are that surprised that women from India can run really fast. Hail mother india !! ⛹️🤼🏊🚴🤾️ This is the story of the entire Indian economy.  The Indian Government fucking people in the ass till they can barely walk, and then the people persevering and triumphing somehow, and then the Minister arrives and places a garland on them and puts articles in the paper so the country looks good.  


If you want to know how full of behanchods the government is, just see how the sports bureaucrats travel and their baggage allowance, and then see how the athletes travel and their allowance.  


Or if you want to feel your gut wrench at the limits of disgust, examine how the sports budget is spent in terms of funds and facilities for athletes versus salaries, benefits, offices, and allowances for the bureaucrats.  


Every time an injured veteran is working some menial job to make ends meet or an athlete is begging around town for sponsors just to get fresh fruits and meat for their diet, Indians should protest.  Because, believe me, Indian Government has allocated enough funds to develop sportsmen and sportswomen in India ... but those funds are being used to employ and benefit behanchods in the bureaucracy instead. Sometimes I feel the country doesn't deserve her. Talents like her are nurtured and groomed in other countries. I know I shouldn't be complaining and working towards it. I normally do. Today is not that kind of day. Pardon me. Proud of her. Feminism aside... Why is her face held together by tape?  Big deal! Hritihk Roshan has 2 thumbs in one hand and still managed to do that dance step! She's an Inspiration for future athletes. My girl!❤️ you go gurl Amazing ! She is real heroine of India.she inspire all people of India for her work. Wish if I could give you a gold for title No shortage of heroin  
FIFY Watching her mom's reaction to seeing her win, I cried.

I hope Swapna gets some brand endorsements, her story is incredible.  We don't deserve her.  Fuck yeah, this woman probably works harder than any of us can begin to comprehend Where can I see her actual performance? I can’t believe the amount of spam videos with slideshows when i google her name!  India doesn't deserve such relentless sportspersons. Sad but true. This should be before she got to Indian team. Typical of Bollywood, let some unknown win some shit and then the Bollywood vultures circle around to make monies and ride to fame Correct me if I am wrong but I've noticed that all of Indian sportspersons are either from quite wealthy families or from very poor families like in this case. The salaried middle class never produces top class athletes. What can be the reason behind this? Jai hind  And I still wonder why Indian women are demanding equality when they are so much better than us Whats the difference in havigg six toes? Damn straight there’s no shortage heroine She was designated runner of India  This. Is what true feminism is. She sure must have the dignity of her country in her head but she is fighting for herself. For a better future and recognition. 
Edit: i forgot to add country. And i still stand by what i wrote.  Lots of heroin in India now [deleted] what a story.....WHAT a story (Y) I love heroin it does not take much to make heroines nowadays....bandage jaw hahahaha Nor heroine Hero* >6 toes in both legs

How did they end up in there That cringy title  [removed] Madarchod.....I feel ashamed now.  Completely off topic thought , we infians need to stop with these made up gender variations of gender neutral words, Especially heroine. You do know what that is right?  All that is fine. However, in your mind it rings Sachinnn....Sachinnnn....that is where Swapna looses the race.",2018-08-30 10:29:33
Sports,Need Home Gym Purchase Advice,15,cedsau,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cedsau/need_home_gym_purchase_advice/,8,"I'm looking to buy a home gym set (weights primarily) online. 

Would appreciate any recommendations for the same.

My budget is around 6k.",Sharchomp," If you are in Delhi, there is a place in Chandni Chowk near Daryaganj and if you are in Mumbai, there are a few shops near Andheri station where you can get dumbbells and other weights for cheap. 

Alternately, if you are friends with some trainer, ask them if they know of some gym owner who is in the process of selling weights - either because they are old or his gym closed down (I got 10kg dumbbells like this for 1.5k) With such a budget you can only make one for yourself. A parallel bar and a dip bar is all what you need. Once you get adjusted to dumbbells those would be useless. But you can vary your workouts on parallel and dip bars. r/bodyweightfitness Sex is a good home exercise.",2019-07-17 22:44:57
