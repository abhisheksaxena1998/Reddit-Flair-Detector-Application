ambassador of india takes back my newly issued oci card suggests pay for and fill out new application please advise  www reddit com india comments bdfid ambassador of india takes back my newly issued hello askindia first time poster long time lurker here xb brief background my wife is indian and am canadian and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in india this summer applied for the oci months ago per her request to make it happen the application never went smooth but that was never expected as goes this story for most oci applicants we properly submitted all our documents and each month like clockwork we receive additional requests from the indian embassy for extra documents that weren requisites on the oci application checklist we happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality no questions just documents months go by since we submitted everything and finally we get notified that my oci card was ready for pick up at the indian embassy just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to india we drive hours to the embassy getting pumped up to an audiobook set in india yes we re nerds when we finally get to the embassy we sit down with our consulur who strangely didn greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting she hands me my oci card its receipt and asks my wife to sign document declaring that she agrees to forfeit my oci card to the government of india in case of my death or divorce however things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn open up specifically for my oci file she stands up picks up my passport and brand new oci card leaves her office to meet with the embassy ambassador and only returns with my canadian passport not my oci she said the ambassador is in bad mood and suggests that fill out and pay for new application excuse me what ve never seen or met the ambassador what is happening she explains that my oci file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in and because it currently there were crossed wires thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my oci my wife and make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and bringing them back to the embassy so they can have hard copy she said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn in good mood would be to fill out and pay for new application back to square one months down the drain we are confused just drove hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can have it and we need to start again we politely try to press her for more information and the best option she has for us was for her to email request to her oci contacts in india to try to resolve this by issuing new file number and new card but not to be optimistic what is going on here any advice would be much appreciated should also add that am canadian living in europe qualified professional in interaction design educated and don have criminal record  honestly she and her supervisor behaved exactly how most of our government officers behave with residents of india inside india they typically do such things to extract bribe can say for sure if she has the same expectation xb one option you have if oci matters so much to you is to tweet your problem directly to india foreign minister sushma swaraj she is supposed to be proactive about such things especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project good but false image of our government and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you also pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the indian way and since you wish to become quasi citizen of india you might as well start learning our bad habits xb personally am not big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials wouldn have gone for an oci to begin with and if absolutely had to for some reason d try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard you have already sunk enough costs for card that is of little benefit suggest dropping the idea entirely as canadian don think you ll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits this lady sounds full of shit why would an ambassador concern himself herself with oci affairs even if she isn lying it worth emailing the consulate embassy politely explaining the situation and cc ing the ambassador if you can find their email if there are multiple consular missions in the country try emailing them as well tweet summary with some details to sushma swaraj she has helped ppl in similar situations hi m sorry to hear that you had to go through this you think these people would adapt to the local work culture ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals which shouldn be the case xb please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs twitter com sushmaswaraj ref src twsrc egoogle ctwcamp eserp ctwgr eauthor twitter com sushmaswaraj ref src twsrc egoogle ctwcamp eserp ctwgr eauthor xb make sure it public and that her twitter is tagged in your post she is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty do keep us posted about things you did for this issue if it is just for visit apply for regular visa you can always visit india as tourist as regards your oci card application tweet or send message to the external affairs minister sushma swaraj with your experience probably you are lying in fine details or it is shitpost or karma whoring as an official one can certainly say that an ambassador is too busy to deal with we drive hours to the embassy getting pumped up to an audiobook set in india yes we re nerds iamverysmart individuals moreover if any of the official encounters technical problems it is impossible for them to say cannot be done because of bad mood an embassy is not your regular post office branches the productivity level despite being in perpetual shortage of stuff is inspiring for all other government branches if you have any kind of proof about your claims of misbehaviour get out of anonymity go for appropriate mechanism if you don know the mechanism pm me your proof will provide you

what steps women can take for their safety askindia  www reddit com india comments eond what steps women can take for their safety time and again we have so many incidents of crime against women india we can have policemen or guardians accompanying women all the time what all steps women can take in case of emergency few things that comes to my mind carry pepper spray also please do an emergency drill for using it learn self defense martial arts carry taser always notify someone while traveling alone in cab auto share registration number of vehicle loudly on call so that driver knows someone is aware of your whereabouts in case you are stranded somewhere if traveling in car do lock all the windows and call the police in case of wheeler just ditch it or ride with punctured tire to nearest petrol pump toll shop never travel alone in an inebriate state please add your suggestions edit stranded not strangled this illusion of control is just that an illusion even guy wouldn be able to defend himself against group intent on overpowering him don know about safety but if you need to pass critical information in case of emergencies you can use automate app it an automation app you can do things with minimal interaction you can also add shortcuts to your home screen so with one tap you can automate hell lot of things use it daily and it a huge time saver for me so during emergencies where every second is crucial you can use that time to send as much as information to your friends and family members there are countless ideas on how you can use this app you play with this app for sometime and you will get it it a powerful app so use it with caution check the child lock before getting into cab also protest demand action hold the authorities accountable educate men speak out against lewd behavior in person and whenever it portrayed in media avoid traveling alone in the night especially in insecure areas request colleague to accompany you if it unavoidable learn self defense or carry weapons but most important of all do not give up your liberty most sexual violence is also intended to subjugate women and lower than standing in society fight for equality and your rightful place in society it sad to see the focus on totally different things in the moment of tragedy no way girl can overcome more than two guys unless she is champion boxer or mixed martial artist instead of asking for police and judicial reforms and like helpline number our focus is on how to make women learn self defense as far as pepper spray is concerned here are some tips make sure there is no wind blowing towards you use it on the face of the suspect and flee immediately practice on dummy in your balcony keep it in keychain or somewhere easily accessible if security person asks what it is you can say it is pocket deodorant etc xb if you are concerned citizen and know of dark scary hostile regions in your neighhborhood don wait for rape to happen to make that space safe it is immensely rewarding to fix lights and increase patrol before something bad happens personal experience if you know of any assaulters rapists in your friend group ensure that everyone you know knows about them and they know they will always be watched don bother with public opinion and women ruin lives with lies bs keeping friends safe is key if you find out that your friends have been harassed or assaulted ensure that anyone who victim blames them or tries to discuss things they could have done to prevent shit is shown the door women spend hours anxious about their safety anyway next steps are more important than what ifs keep names of legal advisors and therapists handy if your friend relative was assaulted as child by some who is still favoured relative family friend it is never to late for them to speak their truth support your person thought their journey ensure that such predators don ever prey on young people ever again keep an eye on them publicly if you are at wedding which serves alcohol and notice rowdy behaviour call it out yes it someone else joyful occasion but drunken assaulters use alcohol crowds and people hesitation to strike alert few sober people and create subtle surveillance system around people who aren in control people who survive assault rape may have ptsd ensure that your responses to news on sexual harassment rape and abuse doesn make them feel like shit it will make you part of their support system be the kind of human whose vulnerable friends would be comfortable and trusting enough to stay over with it saves lives this is what have to do and have had to do carry small concealable surgical blade make perpendicular slits carry small knife and learn how to use it learn how to use it and run away as quickly as you can youtu be ewkjqcyapgs youtu be dvgcrhbzk youtu be cbocizfnagc youtu be bxoscsokccs people have many good suggestions did not see this so adding one here of course if under threat you need to reach out support family friends or assuming you have notified and are waiting for help to arrive and the bad folks have still not gotten to stage where you are overpowered start facebook live or live streaming at least what happened or parts of it will be available to people to get some clues and you can also use it to tell the bad guys that your picture is now on internet while trying to capture either video or photos make sure they are direct to internet will need to set up your settings before hand and you take picture of the area as well as people to the extent you can whenever my wife is alone in cab late nights she always calls me and keeps talking to me loudly throughout the ride she gives driver hints like am man and will meet her at drop point also she shares live location on whatsapp and keep looking at it from time to time if you are ever thrown into the trunk of car kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy the driver won see you but everybody else will this has saved lives carry swiss army knife which my brother taught me to use still don feel confident but hey its there on my phone through google maps have set up location sharing with people when taking an uber have set up sharing of location make it point to inform my family the minute start from and towards my home always make it point to call someone or even fake call the minute am in an auto or car and day how much time roughly it will take me and that they can track me when on my bike am with other bikers so not alone and we travel long distance but not after sundown understand the post positive intention but it is heart breaking that one has to do so much to just to stay safe and to carry on with their life pursue their dreams and to live normal existence in society learn how you could use ball pen always keep metal ball pen target his eyes in times of puncture do not ever worry about it damaging your bike it will cause very minute damage but that is totally worth than putting your life in danger you can go miles with your both tires punctured not sure if you can go faster myself have driven my bike on road trip after getting front tire punctured and the nearest village was km away nothing all those precautions you have listed have time and again be used by different women throughout this country it is already stifling atmosphere for women here and will not blame them for migrating to other countries if they get the chance as man have always loved my independence and the ability to just backpack and go somewhere on my own have seldom thought what it is from the point of view of woman and these recent sexual assault incidents just show side of india which have not personally experienced am of the belief that death sentence and castration should be given to rapists especially for gang rape type incidents have heard many times that death sentences don act as deterrent especially from law enforcement and human rights morons in this country but they are wrong death really does act as deterrent especially with regard to the typical indian male to be frank the average indian man is timid he doesn have the courage to stand up for himself and doesn have the courage to fight for his rights when such an individual is interacting with the opposite sex he feels somewhat of an unknown power because in his mind women are of the weaker sex and come what may he will have power over her when such men group together it can lead to disastrous consequences that is why gang rape is mostly phenomenon of south asian countries and few war torn african countries these same indian men go to foreign countries such as the middle east and europe but they avoid doing the same there why because they have fear of the law our judicial system is overseen by old men and women who can be called dinosaurs in this day and age it all nice for the liberal elite to copy the practices of foreign countries debating whether death penalty is ethical or not while forgetting the demographic differences between the people of our country and foreigners especially with regarding to race iq and upbringing let face it most indians are uncivilized and therefore for uncivilized people stringent laws are applicable barring instances of being innocently charged we could do with some culling of the population especially some men emigrate love how the conversation after catastrophic incident is always about how not to get raped how to defend yourself against rapists instead ya know the initiators of the horrific acts best they can do is fuck off from this awful country and settle to some other where they aint seen as consumable asking women to take safety precautions is fine but the real way to stop rapes is to well stop men from raping xb unpopular opinion but we need to make an example out of the perpetrators of these vicious crimes you can say this is my outrage but these perpetrators do not deserve human rights since they have proved by their acts that they do not deserve to be called human am not suggesting mob lynching here but the law must be extremely strict for rape in this country people need to know that if they commit rape they will be found out and they will be reprimanded severely further all the netas who have rape cases against them need to be brought to book we need to set the example that no matter how high and mighty you are rape in india is serious offence and of course mental health being exposed to pornography and item songs in society where conversations about sex are taboo is another reason why there are so many rapes in india we need sex education and mental health programmme that has better outreach the outraged me says chauk pe khada kar saalo ko baaki sab hum dekh lenge honest question are tasers legal in india migrate from india one most important thing to always remember is as the minister said call the police the moment you feel unsafe don worry about false alarms better thousand false alarms than tragedy similarly if you are the woman relative call the police immediately if her phone is switched off don go by the bad reputation of the police the corrupt judgemental assholes in the police are lot better than the soulless demons on the streets practice running sprint as well as long runs they can do much if they can catch you never travel alone in an inebriate state there are lot more common sense tips like this one could mention the flip side of pointing out the obvious is to attract trolls gave my wife pocket alarm sorta thing no larger than your car key this thing makes very loud annoying noise when active and it is pretty difficult to find the off switch by design for someone who is not familiar with it hope she never have to use it think self defence should be made mandatory in all schools colleges please consider getting trained professionally if you can afford or practice at home if it not affordable our body tends to freeze if we are not trained we need to build bit of muscle memory and mental alertness we rarely have the time to think in such situations am sorry you have to go through this really am well didn mention upper cut because it kind of takes time to learn it essentially doing really quick squat but yeah if you can learn the upper cut in the right way you can certainly ko someone few months ago while sparring my partner mistakenly landed an upper cut to my family jewels had cup but holy shit it still hurt so yeah d say upper cut to the chin or groin will also be great am in manila philippines at the moment and the women are free to roam everywhere anytime of the day or night wearing what they like india is definitely few light years behind in this context adding one please check your phone for sos features most of the current ones do have one where in case of emergency you press the power button certain number of times to immediately alert your preset contacts of your whereabouts and that you need help in xiaomi phones the setting is there under password and security also avoid the outskirts of your towns and cities if possible as those areas are primarily occupied by people who don have future and aren afraid of any consequences to their action matlab bencho apni protection ke liye bhi unko hi mehnat karni padegi ye sikho ye rakho kya zindagi hai ye think you meant stranded instead of strangled should probably add getting concealed carry permit learning how to use said weapon m not advocating vigilante justice or random shootings by scared civilians but d much rather hear about instances of rapists getting their faces shot off in one day than horrific abominable instances of rape seriously ve been in such shitty mood after reading about the poor girl in hyd the police finding another body in similar circumstances literally couple of hours later just absolutely sickened for once due process should take back seat scum should be treated as such leave the country if they can some self defense can help in on situation but it better to avoid potential situation altogether even single vulnerable male cannot prevent robbery or assault the only force equalizer is gun which can take few of the attackers out of the reckoning but that is different discussion until then stay in populated areas and have someone pick you up or call for help not many people know this but on your ola app there an option which can automatically send all your rider information and your cab real time location to your friends family when you ve booked one upto people can be selected think and they ll get an sms as soon as you book ride which also has things like the cab number driver name and number etc edit think uber has the same feature but you have to do it manually after every booking someone please correct me if there an automatic option realise wanting safe streets is not women safety issue it a public safety issue realize our society and injustice system is misogynistic and patriarchal and will not help us become active in an org that works to keep our streets safe like blank noise get fit lift weights learn one martial art carry pepper spray stun gun taser rape whistle learn to use them get angry not scared educate men around you as many as you can the onus shouldn be on women to go out and learn martial arts it should be on society to not have rapists at large think you have pretty much covered we need to make all the six points you have mentioned as practice it terrible how we just skip the part of tackling evil in men when we are talking about this women shouldn be forced to take extra steps for safety men need to be better than unempathetic animals it a sad thing to see to that we just accept evil in men as given it not the women fault it the men here is the only rule that matters be better at bringing up men be better yourself when you hear friends casually catcalling someone speak up tell them that what potential rapists do sure you might be firm in your conviction that you could never do something like that but by not saying anything you are complicit you are the reason why toxic masculinity continues to exist it isn because of the evil men it because of men who aren evil not saying anything be better thought tasers weren legal might have missed something can you buy taser in india always nightmare thank god honestly don like it but guns are the only solution quick and easy carry lighter and deodorant trust your guts if you feel unsafe leave the place with good friend or family member if available if nobody is there then simply sent your current location to family members and do live call video with anybody and speak out loud and tell them where you are in it also go to public place as fast as possible if you think you are in danger where exactly do you get off telling me how to behave delete this post now if you have single brain cell smash patriarchy trying to raise better sons would be really good place to start but of course we re now going to teach women how to become superhuman see few videos on pressure points for self defence leave the country put curfew on men after day light im tired of seeing posts on preventive measures women should take after every heinous incident like this every fucking time we find shortcoming in how the woman in question could have protected herself but the onus is on men to learn how to not reduce women to mere objects and respect their autonomy just taking precautions does not help rapes happen even at home the responsibility is on parents schools and higher education institutions to inculcate manners yes manners to learn how not to behave we have been very good as society to teach girls how to be good wife daughter student or career woman etc but clearly large population of men has an iota of brains on how to treat others especially woman with dignity hope it doesn get lost but there is an app called life it sends very accurate location and has sos and will update your family haven tried the second idea but if you end up in really dire situation call the police they may or may not pick up hope it never comes to it but just try self defence is really chance thing you can ninja through men who are really tough hope it never comes to that individual solution is not an answer to problems which impacts mass for example people are installing water and air purifier for individual needs but it doesn solve the problem at aggregate level and you will always have carry filtered water bottle purchase package bottle at price in which you get x litres and wear masks all the time it goes same in women safety answer is mass protest by women and more women in public safety force india has most strignent law regarding women safety still we hear rape incidents every week why because womens are not raising voice which can shake the country to its core india has female popluation still lacks all majority women party no men majority political party will hear your needs like present government thinks sanitary pads are luxury and they taxed them enough of rant always carry pepper spray emergency alert app learn jiu jitsu and strength training lastly you should able run fast if group tries to attack you peace don be woman lift weights and learn to fight the quran has lot of tips for women safety wear veil have male relative as an escort while going out or travelling do not interact with men who are not family convert to islam

 askindia is it just me or are most of the gym trainers across our nation unqualified  www reddit com india comments bxsezi askindia is it just me or are most of the gym what your experience here are the things ve heard gym trainers say in couple of cities in india translated you won gain weight now it summer you will sweat too much to gain weight you don need to do warm ups dude just lift this guy came three weeks later with his shoulder in sling kya hua dislocate ho gaya you have to do reps everything else is wrong sets of how will the muscle get stimulated compound exercises are for fitness isolation exercises are for muscle building optimum nutrition on koi local brand hoga don listen to doctors doctors themselves come to my gym said by the same guy who said don warm up edit bonus deadlifts one palm grips front one grips reverse haan jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho edit yes the bonus actually isn bad there an argument for it but ll leave it here as testament to my own fallibility and because phaavda leke sounds badass  ve trained for years in ncr hopping gyms every months ve been to some cheap gyms inr month and been to some relatively expensive chains bomiso anytime fitness and one thing is pretty common the trainers all suck in fact in my experience the most knowledgeable gym trainer ve met was at the cheapest gym he owned the gym and was running it in the basement of an actual residence here how ve learnt to deal with the pseudo trainers make them know their place they re there to help you if and only if you ask for help you ve paid for the membership which means you can use the equipment you re under no obligation to listen to trainers be courteous but distant with them say have my routine m doing this many trainers will just leave you alone thinking you already have another plan or know more than them which is actually very probable follow your routine to t so you can impress the same guys with your results in silence best of luck ve been going gym since and have trained quite lot of people for free can confirm that majority of trainers don even know the names and proper form of exercise let alone talking about compound and isolation exercises gyms don have degree requirement so every gym bro or even newbie can apply to become trainer and then keep fucking up everyone else body that just exercise most of the people don even know about nutrition and stuff they will just point you to the nearest supplement counter the deadlift one is actually correct it called mixed grip it improves stability and prevents the barbell from slipping you need to alternate your underhand and overhand when using mixed grip so that you don develop muscle imbalance it damn hot can you turn on the ac it good if it hot you ll sweat more so become thinner wtf png got lucky when started going to gym where there was trainer in his s who knew almost everything there is about fitness that was in and now in bangalore these trainers literally doesn even know to teach pushups in correct form be careful when you choose to join gym any should or knee joint issues will affect you throughout your life dude have been lifting for years and have even helped my friends in transformation till now have not seen single trainer or even competitor who knows his shit have even trained with mr up and he doesn know shit about training these people are complete jackass most of these guys use peds told to them by some trainer and then suffer you can check tarun gill channel on youtube and not even competitor knew his shit of them was telling to stop bathing before competition deleted ve been to gyms in bangalore including cult fitness and yes the trainers don know shit would have got tendinitis if continues with the cult fitness class to be honest most of our workforce except the creamy layer need to be trained and retrained this is the pain which comes with growing nation for instance try looking for handyman who is competent it really hard or they are already working for big company the money they get from the jobs is also not so high so they don put their heart and soul into this so they can make things better hopefully with growth of economy our country workforce skills also grow up used to go to gym for while and one of the trainers straight up told me to take some steroids cause m too skinny optimum nutrition true that lot of trainers focus on unnecessary things or sound phony asf from what ve seen cult seems to carry some good trainers with good certifications most of all all the trainers that ve visited or seen are self made they built good body and then became trainer because of the money so they don exactly know the scientific way but the way that worked for them either way see most indians go through lot of youtube channels and blogs and pick what suits them best my buffy buddies are all from the same method have gone to some form of gym for the past years for years when went to the normal gym was doing squats wrong and no one told me about this dont know if it is because they didnt know or because of not giving fuck since they are underpaid and many of them focus on isolation exercises and not compound or functional exercises which is huge problem went to functional fitness not crossfit but similar gym years ago and that is where came to know about squats deadlift etc but here too the main trainer knows his stuff well while others do not these trainers are also trying to sell either protein powder or dietician none of which wanted this is because they are earning about k per month which is quite less for the amount of hours they put in tbh these trainers make their money from personal training and hence maybe the lack of interest that you see around another important thing that all gyms across the country lack is their ignorance of cooldown most gyms do not focus on cooldown while those that do do not spend more than mins learnt it the hard way by going to the physiotherapist and spending k for rehabilitation currently go to the gym in my building itself the trainer there is good but doesnt know enough compound exercises imo if you are looking at only fitness and have no huge goals you can workout at home itself because there are lot of online channels posting workout videos all you need is pair of dumbells and mat have been lifting for over years this should come as no surprise to you there no regulation unfortunately you re going to have to do your own homework on the internet and use your head to navigate the bro science while lived in bombay used to go to nitrro the membership was quite steep but the trainers knew their stuff there but for the most part elsewhere for sure clueless certified trainers anywhere in the world will cost fortune have been working out for long time without trainer using my own routine and have had fairly good results recommend sites such as scoobys workshop funny name but totally worth it and the forums of bodybuilding dot com the thing to keep in mind is that it takes time to build muscle and get sustainable results there is no quick solution and any person giving quick results is either liar or will end up hurting you yes as with all fields in india which are technical if any of you want to learn to lift or whatever just go to startingstrength com startingstrength com welcome bro use jim wendlers routine which you can find online or buy his book and use my trainer mostly as spotter so that don go bad form and break my back think that the best way to use indian trainers and yes creating routine and dieting wise they all suck according to me this really depends on the franchise gym you go to xb background used to go to gold gym in chennai think it was the first branch they opened in the country and the trainers were all top notch even in maverick flux now think the trainers knew what they were talking about and good proportion of them were looking to get further certifications in the fitness industry xb suppose it a pretty banal case of you get what you pay for the fitness industry like host of other industries that have arrived in india needs some time to mature suppose the bonus isn that bad pros usually deadlift with mixed grip it prevents the bar from slipping too much when compared to double overhand grip that because when the bar starts to roll out of one hand it rolls into the other here are things the trainer at my gym said don pay him he the owner too heavy weights build size and no strength do light weights with reps for fat loss lat exercises reduce love handles side bends reduce love handles people know have had it worse than me their trainer made them do all machine workouts the first day and full body workout every day for month or so and they went to posh gyms so yes indian trainers are pretty bad mainly because we don have the level of education here which is possessed or required to be possessed by someone of that nature most here follow broscience of shock the muscle the trainer at my gym doesn even know what starting strength and are warming up has lot of different connotations warming up with lighter weights to practice form before the lifts that good warming up by running on the treadmill for minutes then practicing judo kicks for the next before you actually pick up weights not productive how to detect bad trainer ask his opinion on leg curls and upright rows if he approves of either of these he a bad trainer depends have been going to gold gym for last years and the one train under is great but it sucks for the wallet the body shape of most gym trainers in india says everything it has to about untrained gym trainers in india gym trainers in india are basically people who have spent shit load of time in or around gyms have seen quite few trainers who don know much but have somehow built good physique but there are also others have met who really know their shit as well as the science behind building muscles something like the athlean guy m never gonna forget the way one of them described chest exercises to me the way they re supposed to be done what people do wrong etc unfortunately that person rarely offers personal training and owns the gym lol does anyone here know how good the cult fit classes are especially the boxing classes deadlifts one palm grips front one grips reverse haan jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho have seen guys do that what the logic of doing that have foudn vice versa also many people are not even willing to listen to sound advice since sound advice requires working on form and technique people in my gym do half squats without wanting to put in effort to master below parallel depth some do close grip bench with very close grip fuck wrists lift arms all the up top in dumbbell rows and despite my reasoning some of these are friends most just stay on since they can lift heavier weights this way with poor form people however flock to model trainer in my gym who looks better than me dont know where you live but live in vasai and in my local gym there are certified trainers have been training for more than years most of the trainers who are certified are always looking for clients because they earn more throught clients than spending more amount of time being employed inthe gym my advice is do your research if you are willing to invest time and money in the gym you should invest some time in picking up routine and progressively overload most trainers suck they offer diet advice even when they know they are not supposed to they don understand that rep range depends upon fitness and advice reps to everyone the good thing is ve met some good trainers they don try to force their methods on everyone lucked out way back in the day and ended up with high level powerlifter as trainer he was into heavy lifts low reps and lot of rest in between sets lucked out in joining the gym it was cheap great equipment empty most of the time so the trainer had nothing else to do but chat with me and give fitness tips wow lot going on here have been trying to get fit and get regular at gym but don know what should do am not experienced with the equipment and gym instructors only help out in the initial few days of joining gym any ideas where can learn the movements and how to do them safely d like to avoid injury at all costs have tried watching tutorials on youtube but it there is too much noise there to make senseful plan gymming veterans please help guide me bonus deadlifts one palm grips front one grips reverse haan jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho this one is correct advice but you don need to do this for lower weights as you stack more weights the chance of slipping goes up also when you lift the plates can spin little because both your wrists are facing the same direction the momentum can be enough to cause the barbell to spin out from your hand tbh ve seen lot of bro sciency stuff even in the west trainers who keep updating their knowledge are the best ones ones who haven will tell you it ok to do lat pull downs behind your neck like they used to years ago anytime fitness here pays general trainers like k for hours shifts good occasionally competing trainer eats k month senior trainers are also some months certified ones with years of lifting experience xb but this thing is fading with the ecoms and these new indian youtubers like jeet salal gaurav taneja mybollywood body guru mann sangram chougule sahil khan etc so these trainers nowadays are mainly just for spotting weights or running an illegal steroid cycle what gyms have you heard these from supporter nhi phnega toh chhota ho jayega paani bhar jayega have learned the proper forms techniques and workouts from youtube yup they are they also practice the worst bro science and will just take juice to get their body if you wanna join fitness and health discord server to discuss gym supplements diet share your progress etc discord gg ucgerhw deleted ur right thats the case with percent of the trainers these guys are filled with bro science and have at some point in their life and or currently taken steroids to get their body where it is now these idiots also peddle steroids growth hormones growth hormone releasing peptides to young naive gym goers to help reach the ideal instagrammable physique off late these dumb fuck trainers have discovered muscle building content on youtube via fake natties and sellouts further fuelled with social media and popular forums and are again peddling misinformation and bad plans to people there seems to be no end to this chutiyapa people need to have thier eyes opened to the right information yes deleted deleted darebee com for routines and freeweight exercises this is very true one guy who used to train in our gym for few years off and on has now become trainer for reputed gym brand won say the name as don want him to get in trouble apart from the fact that he weighs barely more than feather we know that he doesn know thing about exercises let alone nutrition and stuff so yeah that bound to happen also most of them force you to increase the weight without asking you to do so progressively infact they don even care about form which is really important ratio of gym patrons with fit bodies to unfit bodies is surprisingly high at my gym d think the trainers do good job here why would you call yourself bad trainer started training in and have been training for the better part of last years in hyderabad have been to multiple gyms from cheap to the expensive ones core fitness in my experience most of the gym trainers that have met and conversed with don know anything about training and bodybuilding most of trainers that have encountered are just bunch of guys who trained for few years using ped and steroids being completely clueless about basics of training supplementation and nutrition infact most of them are just there to sell you products like protein powders bcaa creatine and that too fake ones even most of the youtubers present in indian bodybuilding community like rohit khatri tarun gill etc do not provide science based empirical studies and evidence behind their exercises and videos and is just bro science personally find youtubers like seth feroce youtube www youtube com channel uckzucxxdeougdebetcjhpw and jeff nipard youtube www youtube com user icecreamprs the best in the industry when it comes to sharing knowledge relating to supplements exercises importance of warmups gear amongst other things have learnt the most from their youtube channels amongst all the youtubers that used to follow xb xb few of my personal favourite seth videos shoulder workout youtu be htdet youtu be htdet xb steroids www youtube com watch pvp hnqnmq www youtube com watch pvp hnqnmq damm have been working out since and all the knowledge have is from the internet cause the trainer i have met don know shit it good to see educated gym goers like you guys who actually give shit about things like form compound movements proper warmup etc hope can meet some of you in real life someday and share the love for working out beginner m here with kg weight anybody can help suggest me something guys agree with mostly all of you but koi mujhe yeh batao ki original supplements aur sahi rates mai kaha milenge flipkart aur amazon pe mai chutiya katwa chuka hu on completely different note have you tried training with kettlebells the stuff will turn you into beast m never going back to isolation workouts you re not alone with this kind of experience this is an example of job that can pay better in india than outside of india knew an american who made excellent money gym training in mumbai better than he would have back in the us tl dr version of my answer is yes my trainer is completely aversive to suggest supplements but gives some bs advices at times the most ridiculous being his diet charts follow the fitness wiki and the website exrx net as someone who is deciding to make career in fitness starting as personal trainer which institute do you guys suggest so far ve heard of k ace acsm ifsi gold i ve failed th std so can do ace or acsm their sites say that th is required as qualification any certified trainers here that can guide me once saw guy doing bent over rows on smith machine no shit sherlock

and she is and we have two kids girl and boy am very upset the marriage is broken irreparably want out have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over the wait of next two days sees unbearably long knowing my wife know it going to be big drama which want to avoid at all costs just want to put evidence of her activities before her and part our ways silently what kind of technology can use to monitor her email phone voice and text social media communications fb for few days will also hire pi the first thing the next week d like to have full custody of our children does anyone know under what conditions will be able to get that edit thanks for all your responses few were helpful few disturbing and few others distasteful anyway am just normal at home as if nothing happened have strictly predictably routine and intend to keep it that way am off to drop my daughter at her friend place who is celebrating her birthday today am very methodical and ll deal with this issue just like that am going to write down everything plan to do rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer he responded plug holes and build solid case there are many suggesting that don monitor her activities as it illegal can appreciate that but am anyway going to do it what important to me primarily is the evidence the truth and the full picture what do with it is totally different matter altogether may not tell her may just poke and see the response may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings and that up to lawyer anyway or may just burn it all the world doesn need to know employed an investigator to collect evidence legal or not  deleted hey am fighting domestic violence case filed against me by my wife there are few things want to share first things first custody mostly goes to mothers and the fathers get visitation rights on weekends festivals etc the legal system in india is highly biased in favor of women not to discourage you but adultery in india is very difficult to prove in one case man produced pictures of his wife in compromised positions with another man and in turn his wife filed new case of outraging her modesty it is not impossible but difficult now main issue money everything will come down to money how much are you willing to give to her so that she says yes for divorce they call it settlement which in easy words is extortion everybody in the system right from clerk to judge will ask you to settle lumpsum money or else monthly maintenance for her if you file divorce chances are you will get a dv package in return this are some of the problems now some solutions main gather all the evidences that you can each everything document everything and she shouldn know about it gather her job records salary slips if she is working and education records if she isn working list down all your assets and liabilities document stuff that shows she has been careless mother if you are able to prove adultery beyond reasonable doubt you have cracked it sc said that wife committing adultery is not entitled to get any maintenance or other monetary benefits most importantly keep cool head don lose heart happens with many of us and you are not the only one who is wronged be motivated and never lose your focus on your job work your value is just because of your job work document everything meticulously chat msgs from years back your paper documents the money you both spent everything as detailed as you can you never know what can come useful don confront until you have solid evidence custody is something that usually isn affected by adultery as in you aren going to get full custody simply because of the fact that your wife cheated economics and stable environment are the key factors there the simplest way to get access to fb or phone lock is to stand behind the person when they re unlocking and sneak look then ask to make call or something and use it there no magic hacking apps or something like that so try not to download virus in the enthusiasm stay calm go take walk or long shower as in chess when you re position is disadvantaged it time to slow down consolidate your position and think about the next move carefully not throw the game in anger good luck and keep us posted op removed d recommend you in any emergency case of a dv connect to shonee kapoor this guy literally nailed his own case with victory adultery and post that false a court had quashed his case and he didn have to give any kind of maintenance hope you are fine brother please collect as much evidence as you can phone call recordings pictures chats smses every goddamn thing you have against her very high probability that the opposition lawyer will suggest your wife to file all those a dv bullshit charges for sure so that they could harass you more hell these things literally deter me from getting married in the future removed women tend to have an upper hand in these situations my question is the person married or not sorry to hear that buddy can only wish you good luck and offer you beer keep your chin up take paternity test sincerely dude consult family lawyer he would be able to give you far better advice than any user out here marriage and divorce are huge thing in india so there is no escaping the family drama lesson learnt never gonna get married first up remove the personal details you have supplied in the first post can easily be passed on to your spouse if somebody connected adept at reddit goes through it adultery is grounds for divorce regarding custody it is generally true that it is awarded to the mother however in this case her behaviour would be strong consideration to award it to you disclaimer nothing in this comment should be construed as legal advice please contact lawyer from now on you may want to screenshot all chats with her and also record phone conversations what kind of technology can use to monitor her email phone voice and text social media communications fb for few days do not go down this path you ll come out worse off than before how did you find out is the evidence fool proof who is the guy she is cheating with hey m little late to the thread but thought d chime in bit being lawyer you re being remarkably level headed about this which is huge plus that being said understand your motivation to gather evidence but make sure you do nothing illegal you don want to have criminal case against you and as others have said our judicial system is quite biased towards women competent lawyer could easily allege stalking outraging the modesty of woman indecency etc another thing is to make sure you go to the right lawyer you mentioned you re going to the best lawyer in the city make sure he she also practices in the district courts where your case will be filed the best lawyers usually tend to practice in high courts and the supreme court and lose touch with trial court practice if you have anything you need to ask feel free to message me hope everything works out for you hit the lawyer delete gym facebook up if you have multiple devices lying around like an extra tablet ipad and by any chance if she logged into fb on those device you could use that to read her fb chat logs and take screenshots don confront her without evidence plan with your lawyer have no experience but have read and seen movies and m speaking from those stories pretty sure you are taking the right decision get off that cheating piece of shit erm pretty sure it illegal to monitor her email phone look dude don have any idea about this stuff but most of the people here are saying to gather enough evidence so will suggest try to hire private investigator who will help you with that stuff also contact your lawyer about this if you don have any evidence then play it cool or else she will figure out something is up and guess you know in which case she might file fake domestic violence charges against you to make your future claims look unreliable also would recommend you delete this post too just in case she or her lover frequents this sub firstly freeze your bank accounts and other valuables so that wife does not have access then collect as many evidences as possible video and audio recordings work best after all this confront your wife and ask your divorce tell her that you have strong evidences if she resists hey op firstly m really sorry to know you re in such situation it sucks however you seem to have level headed plan for the future don listen to folks who are suggesting you to stay married just for the sake of kids family blah blah blah cheating is dealbreaker and nothing can amend that the toughest part is the legal battle ahead of you and you making sure that you don end up with bad deal by the court therefore don confront gather evidence pretend to act normal until you have it all and are confident that your case is strong only then proceed with filing case etc best of luck op more power to you whether you want divorce or not is entirely your decision don listen to any of the toxic advice on here regarding that the best thing you can do now is think of her purely as the mother of your children and not your wife try and be as mature as you possibly can for the sake of your children asking for full custody of your children hence depriving them of mother because she cheated on you is unfair on you her and most importantly your children it will also make you look vengeful and petty more than that it will really affect your relationship with your kids in the future her cheating on you is no indication of her being bad mother lastly for god sake do not try to track her communication stalk her or snoop around as you know it illegal and if the court she find out it will make you look really really bad you say you are not planning to do that to gather evidence for the court why else are you doing this then how on earth will doing this help you deal with the situation you say she is dramatic but if you do this then you are fighting fire with fire go to good lawyer and listen to them reddit is not the place to get advice for this stuff this place is full of immature teens and young adults who have no idea what you are going through and they ve probably never been in relationship before they are self admittedly giving you advice based on movies you don need this right now go to lawyer and stop listening to reddit m sorry for what you are going through hope you are able to deal with this well and be there for your children this is going to be really difficult for them so try and make it as easy as possible for them don make them choose between you and her they need both parents good luck op fucking hoes man and the damage is almost unrepairable been so long still can trust anyone good luck mate how old are your kids it very difficult for the father to get custody of his teenage children you should take advice from the pi only regarding snooping her is that even legal and why don you confront her it will be messy but might really prevent some miscommunication on your part you can monitor her phone and social media that illegal don break the law as part of collecting evidence any sensible lawyer she hires will have that shit thrown out and hurt your case irreparably d say it lucky that she doesn know you know keep it that way and follow the advice of your lawyer hello op sorry to read about the pain you are experiencing know that extra marital affairs have become extremely common in india and most people including the cheating spouse are not aware of the problems and pains it causes which can be extreme many people have given you advice in this thread so won try to offer you that but request something from you from reading your replies it is clear that you have experienced great psychological trauma want you to please share your thoughts and feelings about this major incident of your life what went through your mind did you feel disgusted insulted outraged what kind of topics did you think lot upon etc think this will help many people who are reading this thread and it may also help you release some built up pressure by explaining in detail your pain and suffering ll be very obliged in cases of adultery the married one most of the times isn willing to give up the marriage for the lover sake the lover is dropped like hot potato when the marriage is at stake if you are open for reconciliation you can go through therapy to fix things obviously it hard to place faith in someone involved in infidelity but it your choice you have kids if you don want your kids to grow up without their mother you can consider this option technical info like call logs location history etc is tracked by google activity by default unless turned off but you need access to her gmail id to avail that it could be add on to whatever you gather from pi wish you the courage and strength to face this difficult times deleted welcome to the club enjoy your future days deleted when you finally decide to talk this over make sure you are ready with all sorts of trail and evidence ok know you re upset and you have every right to be but you re asking for full custody because she cheated you re going to take your anger which you justifiably have towards your wife on your children by depriving them of their mother m not sure how the law works where you are but where am emails and all that begotten without consent of the other person do not count in court of law hire pi and also do what best for your kids she may be shit wife but she has right also to her children this is not the right forum consult relationships relationship advice specifically mention that you are in india hi its upsetting to read this but from my experience of being standing and seeings frnds irreparable marriage would like to suggest something is it the first instance this this is happening mean had your alwaays marriage been in problems how did this all start the the distance between of you increasing after any particular event what want to say is the the cheating only reason had she never loved you the cheating is more of need for love or togetherness or just cheating also one more thing has your daily life with her gone worse like daily fights or and things or just act cool and she does too just pretend we all are cool and lovely may sound wrong but we all know when things start to go wrong the distance between people starts increasing if you really love her and you can find human reason for what she is doing can that can be repaired would suggest you take higher stand than her know its hard but at the end you would know are better gave her chance maybe there might be some mistakes must have made on the way that she wanted to distance from you and find love somewhere else but you know we are humans and we need love the only thing would to suggest you is if feel this is not cause of the distance that had been growing since time keep gathering your evidence and keep it safe look it at perspective of why would she do that find reason in those evidences and history have together sometimes people drift away in search of love donno who to blame in these cases but as person with understanding the human nature can we give try to give human instinct some chance think we can from my experience would suggest gather evidences with mere goal of knowing whats wrong if this looks more like cheating than just person trying to go away will know if its sexual escapade or find for love will be able to see those in chats or anything while at it would suggest try to talk to her not openly maybe ask her whats wrong why has your relationship detoriated over time if it has maybe she wont open up it will take time make sure you dont sound like are accusing her of cheating coz that thing is going to make her feel guilty as hell and she wont let know anything further if your goal is to just leave her then dont think about what have said above but is you plan it know things and what has gone wrong coz all this pain you and cant bliv this has happened can try to talk and know whats wrong no need to present evidences maybe she comes back if she starts to realise the distance has increased and she has done grave mistake all best op we humans are the capable of mistake as well as forgiveness dont forget this dont need to continue may have already tried all those things have said above maybe are at the brink on no way out so can understand need to have ur freedom too ur peace of mind too have great day op deleted can give you the exact value of pi don monitor her personal stuff it doesn look good on your part questions you need answer to yourself how is she as mother would the kids be okay with you getting sole custody it seems like you have not confronted with her yet may be you have not been available much to her she is human after all this is perfectly repairable you need to be more understanding and accepting don take this step ignore other guys advising about divorce collecting proof etc it depends try to hint to her and warn see if it can improve the situation if you really love her or she loves you there is still hope if you believe in virginity and all those stuff by all means try to fix it and live with her else life of kids will be mess if mother has affair that can hurt kids badly if father has affair not that much think well and decide all the best man try to amend this relationship you are breaking your home you are looking into years of litigation including dowry maintainance child custody and possibly defamation rape more if your wife is clever your whole life will become mess children divided do yourself favor don get involved in this mess am facing such mess and it not worth it give her one last warning and discuss the problems frankly with her maybe you are not giving her enough time she is human after all 
 askindia can dawood ibrahim be free man as per current state of indian judiciary  www reddit com india comments dicm askindia can dawood ibrahim be a free man as per  before anybody comments shit instead of discussion i a th generation maharashtrian that know of and rd generation mumbaikar aged so obviously m not muslim or pakistani posting here its sad that it has come down to this that one has to prove his nationalism for any freeminded discussion we all let it happen it our fault not of bhakts not dalit but chitpavan brahmanvad so can claim my hinduism to any hindutva turd and tell them to back the fuck off in real world ll show my clout and power to those if and when need arises because that not relevant here and m just clearing this for stupid and ignorant bhakts now since that part is cleared definitely am not supporter or fan of dawood or his chain of gangsters ever dawood was just name whom every gangster wannabe wanted to have that kind of power that he had in his time of late s and s everyone as kid used to mock himself as bhai or dawood gang leader just for fun that was the kind of cult dawood had in his prime the mumbai underworld king look at any big international gangsters stories and dawood was no different from actors to politicians businessmen and builders gold and diamond merchants and every small or big scale citizens of india was affiliated with dawood once directly or indirectly during that period only the law enforcement and cops gave actual shit to pin his empire down and common citizens never gave fuck about it like how the common people are doing now but it is pointless since he is overseas or pakistan or wherever he can easily travel m positive that he had hands on mumbai serial blasts everybody thinks that because some cops were sure of it based on tips and infos but that that finito no hard evidence to back up the cops theory cuz it obvious he didn plant those bombs himself his minions did and those minions of his used some rd party to do the dirty work similar to lower class poor needy should shitbag so one cannot even prove that it links to dawood based on hard evidence there is none it only feeling that we think dawood did it no matter how much we as citizens believe that he did it our judiciary will still not be convinced and will let him go scott free because it happened years ago ofcourse dawood will not come down and will confess not will his supporters or even his enemies will do it too because even his enemies hates cops and law and order common ground between every rival gangster is that to keep cops at bay so nobody will ever come out and will be witness chotta rajan hahaha he was once part of dawood gang so whatever he will claim will come down to him as well to be honest he is no good use to the courts as he himself is criminal with so many cases against him ofcourse he has knowledge of dawood whereabouts but how much really does he know since years have passed and dawood is still nowhere to be traced even if he is located how will anybody bring him to india and even if he is nabbed what will be the charges how will he be put behind bars cuz so far not single chargesheet has been made against him criminal or otherwise he is still well protected by his old friends who are old politicians actors and businessmen who are much too afraid that whatever criminal charges will be put against dawood it will all be linked to them one or the other ways so how is he terrorist criminal and most wanted when in reality nobody wants him in india or else all hell will break loose once he starts to reveal all the dirty secrets which current politician wants that why would these rich people wants noose on their neck to bring dawood back to end terrorism for good these rich people will sacrifice their years good image another thing is what dawood did back then is the very same sadhvi pragya was charged for serial blasts that is now she is in modi government because the lawyers got her out because it lawyers job to defend and they won do the same for dawood if the price is right so it is safe to say dawood of he gets nabbed and sent back to india he will get out scott free it only that the bjp has put an image that since he is muslim and is in pakistan so he is terrorist what they will never say is dawood is free man in india even today but if dawood chooses to reveal all the secrets no politicians actors actresses businessmen images will be safe and he would have done that if he was really going to get nabbed but he is most definitely not our cbi is smart enough to get chidambaram and all but not him please rajnath singh on and parliament session as home minister of india dawood pakde jayenge  only if his name was ram avtar 
 askindia what are your unpopular generalizations about society  www reddit com india comments aftiwi askindia what are your unpopular generalizations a thread for things you ve observed to hold true but which will probably piss people off ll start bhai fans are generally assholes people who still support demonetization are too far gone in the head to be reasoned with also they tend to be bhai fans restaurants that promise varieties of dosa usually cannot make even basic dosa properly  public chutiya hai indian people don really care much for their lives well most of em the way roads are crossed the way trains are clinged on the way cars are driven the way electricity lines boards are set up the way no one cares about allowing access to handicaps the way people wanna go before the ambulance can go on and on and on it weird that people show fright when they watch horror movies or when some mob gathers to beat them but the way they go about living each day of their lives doesn show they care much about taking care of themselves ve seen this hold especially true in macho men and less in women removed activists only care for issues while the issues themselves are unpopular or not talked about because they get off on the feeling of being the only ones fighting for it they throw protests with people at cafes nobody visits and then complain that society doesn take the issue seriously the moment their issues get momentum from the masses they find some reason to criticize the movement and stay out of them when someone popular takes up an issue like an actor who has x more reach than any activist or when it becomes hashtag with millions of people taking part they won try use this momentum to strengthen the movement they ll just belittle it and write long think pieces about how the public personality is missing the point or how everyone else is wrong and how they and they alone understand the true nuance of the situation when the nirbhaya movement saw massive crowds form across the country noticed so many feminist activists stay out of it because it was middle class protest and because where were you when previous rapes had happened they criticized the movement instead of adding to it ve noticed this happen so many times on so many different issues that ve given up thinking it limited to just one branch of social activism my generalization is that activists hate when the people actually take up their issue because they no longer feel like its their issue parents are always right whatever they do is for your good not true baap bada na bhaiya

minded person who keeps criticizing others non stop sure they will talk shit one day or another but not feminism in india is different from actual feminism started as suffrage movement by ms pankhurst feminism means wont disrespect woman opinion just because she is woman men and women need to understand the differences in the gender men need to realise that women have their own brain and self respect not all need constant pampering and looking down upon that you are equally responsible for your household only girls not responsible generally ppl don complain for things until it starts affecting themselves the issue isn that you have stress or problems in your life the issue is you don know how to deal with it society pokes its nose into anything and everything

help how do stop my dad from squandering away his savings  www reddit com india comments dwnioc help how do i stop my dad from squandering away  background my dad retired years back from government organization where he did not have pension scheme he has saved l or so over the years to sustain for himself he has had thoughts for opening playschool because he wanted to do something in education noble idea yes but he does not have any background in education teaching etc and understanding how schools are run more importantly the problem is that my dad unfortunately lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people he tried to have franchise with one company signed contract and lost l there that the company refused to return this was done without much consultation with me where could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it next he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent l till date running at significant loss also have elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else we all are living in different cities they in mumbai am in delhi parents are in up my sister in law did step in as school coordinator initially but found teaching gig right step imo elsewhere soonafter year to date there are only children with teachers who mostly sit whole day my dad acts as school coordinator current situation lately he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out school is being run in rented out building he also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings ignoring number of suggestions made etc to put cherry on the cake came across profile of an experienced school coordinator which suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was muslim which wasn something expected of my dad but that another story my concern stems from the fact that this is deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses this is worrying for me because have started job just years back and expect it be at least years before am in position where can help him out bit additionally the current tenant has has are pretty good it offers recurring cashflow in terms of his savings my take on this is that if he wants to focus on education why not simply open scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids while there is no upside to this financially the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money imo tl dr dad burning money in an educational venture how do stop this  get trusted relative or close friend of him and ask them to explain all what you said to your father mean get someone who is true well wisher of your dad and is someone who your father listens to your dad only reason for opening school is to gain social influence among his peers and community don think he will stop this madness until he is starved of his savings if he was so concerned about kids he would have funded underprivileged children education rather than starting school just make sure he doesn start contacting any european women while he at it don understand this you dad wants to start school or does he want to teach each of them are very different adventures have you tried to find out what is motivating him to start the school show him some examples of the risk associated with running play school especially the legal risk that could be deterrent to some assume he doesn have other fall back options financial for his own care medical expenses then highlight that too considering that your father has had considerable expertise in some field in the govt sector why not redirect him to start consulting firm in his core area of expertise there are still area where experience matters especially in govt sector don support him financially right now because you ll just be enabling him besides when he goes broke you ll be one who they turn to show him mota bhais photo to be honest it sounds like he won listen to you would suggest try to talk to him using numbers charts as someone suggested speak to your brothers get them to understand the financial risk and get them to commit to supporting your dad when he loses all his savings when the above don work speak sternly to your dad tell him you ll limit the money you ll give him when he burns through his prepare for everyone to get pissed off at you unfortunately it your financial future at stake everyone is going to throw kulcha in your face be prepared for this to become big stink and for him to lose all his money and for you to have to support him for the rest of his life anyway but at least you would have tried and can tell him and your siblings you told them so when they ask you to give up of your income looking after him if your dad wants to open professional school take him to see how one functions after govt job in up he may have very different expectations of how work happens seeing functioning one would give him context and feel for the entire project instead of stubbornly dithering in the dark if your dad just wants prestige he thinks he deserves cause of govt job but didnt get after retirement and is trying to manufacture said by throwing money around abandon ship he has to come to terms with fact that the time to throw money around has passed can think of two things either convince your dad or reduce his liquidity your mother tried to talk with him what is her stand can she convince your father to put at least some money in her name in non flexible instruments like nsc ppf or tax free bonds gold small peice of land would it be helpful to visit to financial counselor who can point out how little lakh is to spend retired life would it be good idea to convince him to be associated with an educational institute for couple of years and learn tricks of the trade would he be willing to be associated with ngo that works in field of education can you try to talk to engage him with other people who tried education business but failed if everything fails think you should make it very clear that you will not support him financially whether you do so or not is choice that you can make in future tread carefully on this last one it will surely break his heart you also risk to loose inheritance am just hoping that this will give him shock and may be he will consider what he is doing ask him to take up full time part time teaching job in some govt school no risk impart knowledge earn some pocket change and keeps him occupied let him burn it and when he is dependable on you ruin his life witb many told you so on serious note play school is not very good venture to put your money in currently and its gonna br very hard to push towards profit and needs lot of effort so slowly do some research and shift it in your dads house buy out share and be partner talk like businessman and tell him now you would handle it then hire that coordinator and just give your dad share and tell him to relax but make sure someone your dad listens to passes on all this to him your dad seems to be one of those people who never listen to their kids this is general issue with indian parents they raise children as investments and expect returns from them when the children become capable else you get labelled as nalayak or kamini aulaad by the society they don care about saving for the future or about how they ll get money when it runs out since you re always going to be there when things get hard it one of the pitfalls of closely knit rather than individualistic culture but that the discussion for another day and my brother are going to be very set financially have an awesome job with amazing pay and my brother is in very good college and is generally pretty good at what he does however already warned my parents to not see us as investments which will generate returns and rather save for your retirement m still going to help them if things get bad but it won be because they managed money poorly as result they ve started saving and investing money for themselves and aren speculating real estate anymore think you also need to do the same ask him how does he think he ll survive once his saving runs out if he has plan good if he doesn make it clear that you won help as you ve got your mouth full in bad economy make this very very clear he needs to be fucking adraid if he still manages to get into bad spot financially due to external factors help him obviously but this should stop him from squandering money if he wants to be nobel and wants to help tell him to teach people at home for free or volunteer for free at school or ngo nearby there a lot of help people can do with time rather than money why you do this op quit your job and help out your enterprising dad you are lucky to have dad who has this entrepreneurial spirit bc you should help him reach his goal this is the major problem with indian society you don support people who start business you need to help him attain this goal man at that age is having ambition is rare occurrence it tells that he will have character and commitment don understand why you judge that he won succeed you need to believe in him and his goal he will do great help him do great as an entrepreneur this is my piece of mind

broke up what next  www reddit com india comments alpdh broke up what next hi everyone browse through reddit quite bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships life so here goes my story little about myself m yr old indian woman working in it and earning well am the only kid and my mother raised me as single parent after my dad left us she has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other indian families had my share of relations when was young and was single for considerable amount of time in mid and made good use of it started traveling and over years have come to love it travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say am decent at both being single also taught me value of friendships and m fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years met my bf yrs two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together as we started talking about future realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business agriculture he mentioned it casually once yr ago had no idea he was serious about it refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to place which has zero opportunities for career hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances for the reasons above and also that would be giving up all my friends leaving my mom work travel everything for one person seemed like bad deal we tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup this breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything want to stop feeling negative about my ex somewhere feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for yrs and stop feeling sad for myself am scared that might end up alone given the age taboo caste etc in india and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head any suggestions are welcome thanks ablahnaari xb xb  chill dude no need to worry it better to be alone than with someone with whom you re not comfortable living by yourself has its own advantage you have time is not that old get back out there when you are ready don blame yourself or your ex if you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise if it had to end its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later give it some time and re evaluate feelings always clouds reality everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens time heals most wounds if you let it stay positive am years old have never been in relationship no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons yet keep faith while also keeping fit enjoying my life finding new interests and try to travel as much as can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and society last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards love has no sell by date you mentioned you love to travel do more of it its great distraction plan trip in the near future travel has healing and transformative powers wish you all the best the dude lived in the city for years and wants to go farm let him he seems passionate about it don hold him back as for you you are too young to be worried about what gonna happen to you take it easy and move on you have no idea what in store that ablanaari shit was funny though am scared that might end up alone given the age taboo caste etc in india and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head stop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself better person pickup some new hobbies hang out with your friends or try making new ones have to admit that have not travelled as much as you did but my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home you will get better solution as am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems lpt just talk to as many people as possible find new things to do the less you sit and ponder the better it ll be give it time and then ponder and let go live life forward not backwards you took the right longterm decision the blaming bitterness and sadness for few months is common convince and coax your mind that you took good positive long term decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned express your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way for me writing them in detail in diary worked but if you re not into writing record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself or if you have close friend who a good listener express it in front of them don know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps but it does as for fear of society most people don bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite bit d suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons such as love and companionship and never for negative or shallow reasons such as fear reputation social status take it from o guy who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love xb smoke joint let go off things and start afresh ain too old you still have good years before you settle down goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget something just broke up its very normal to hate your ex even if he she hasnt done anything horrible xb be kind to yourself im not believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me what are you going through is grief its the same feeling as you would feel if loved one died you probably already know the stages of grief you are going to go through all of it not in sequence but in circles give yourself time and be kind to yourself xb trust me went through this im not out yet but am million times better than what was immediately after curious question is the word abla or ablah know certain indian demographic ppl like to add around their s but cmon why here am pretty sure the actual word is abla thankhs

malayalis in germany protest after hindu groups object to serving of beef at indian food fest www indiatoday in world story malayalis in germany protest after hindu groups object to serving of beef at indian food fest nan chutiyas go to country famous for beer and its sausages pork beef and protest serving of beef on german soil same chutiya group support the pro nazi groups in hating muslims and halal food foreign me bhi ye hutiyapa shuru ho gaya oh man we are just cking bunch of parasites spreading shits wherever we go they happily go and eat in german restaurants selling beef they suck upto beef eating germans but if their own people sells beef or eat beef then they go nutsss hypocrites this reminds me of that hasan minaj bit where he compares the indian diaspora to biryani keep the weird shit out and bring the good stuff in objection on beef in germany motherfuckers this is the land of beef and pork fuckers go back to india why the fuck are you even in germany go back inside modi arse and eat dhokla suppose they were serving porota beef no one comes in between malayali and his porota beef ffs m hindu and those assholes don represent me just like the taliban doesn represent muslims anyone can eat what they want honestly would stand with these guys and tell those wound ups to fuck right off objecting beef in germany lol these guys are unbelievable if you can tolerate people with different eating habits maybe you shouldn be living in places where people have different eating habits than you just stay home back in india if you re so close minded this is is stupid if you dont wanna eat then dont eat the beef why restricting others bc puri duniya samne ijaat ka kachra kar rahe hai ye narrow minded bhadwe how much common sense can anyone lack to understand food pyramid human history and humanity keep crying bitch supreme leader modi doesn have jurisdiction in germany well the malayalis should have boycotted the event fuck these rw nuts why such compulsion if you don like beef don eat it let others enjoy aise log india ko har jagah badnaam krte hai germany jaakr bhi berozgaar ho to isse acha vapis aa jao these assholes can leave people in peace anywhere in god damn world don go and settle in beef eating countries oh that would be india the country you left in the first place now sanghi pigs have started spreading their cancer abroad idiots protesting other idiots its an indian food fest not hindu food fest of indians have no prohibition against beef and do eat beef what moronic times we live in just so you guys know it part of hindu culture to eat beef sad day cgi germany bowed down to goons maybe they should come right back bitches these extremists don decide what is indian culture there are several states where beef is eaten kerala assam arunachal pradesh mizoram meghalaya nagaland tripura and west bengal are the states where there are no restrictions on cow slaughter indian culture isn based on what majority does either if that is the case then lynchings would also have to be considered as an indian culture in the case of beef some indians eat it some don so if you are part of india you can say that your country doesn eat beef if you want to say that then you aren talking about india anymore it isn against indian culture to eat beef it isn against hinduism to eat beef either because there are many texts that show that beef was consumed by hindus for years the most these extremists can say it is that their political parties and groups don eat beef ie bjp rss etc go mallus however some right wing hindu organisations raised objections over the menu saying that serving beef was direct attack on indian culture and threatened to create ruckus during the festival clear case of cgi frankfurt getting bogged down by what can be called terrorists or atleast mafia do these north indians never visit german resturant or drive out germans from other food fairs where m pretty sure some beef would be common oh no there they must integrate and be diverse yeah just when we have ou diverse culture on display they want it shudh shakahari not in non nazi regime my aryans what are these idiots doing outside the country then fuckers come back to your up style yogi rajya if you want to follow your version of shuddh indian culture fucktards from what know of cultural food festivals foreign embassies ask their expatriates to present the culture of their home country in the form of food movies books drama souvenirs to the natives it is way for the natives germans in this case to experience the culture of other countries india sanghis objected to kerala stall serving beef as though kerala culture cannot be presented to the germans as indian food you can be sure that sanghis would have also exercised control through their thug organisations to decide what movies and books would have been presented to the germans it is important to understand this larger fight of control over what defines india rather than look at this as just another instance of sanghis preventing keralites consuming beef the event was called indian vegetarian food fest here is the coverage from german national

remembrance of years of gandhi don understand why this protest when the event was openly called vegetarian food festival here the reason why malayalis keralites whatever prefer are protesting ig as malayali can speak for facts nri in germany are mostly malayali like most of the nri in singapore are from tamil nadu and punjabi in canada hindu christian muslim areligious malayali eat beef in

had to shut one of my food outlets www reddit com india comments dkmm had to shut one of my food outlets the economy is going to the bin people are always expecting percent discounts this outlet of mine use to do sale of on week days and now its gone to day not to mention with all the zomato problems its hurt business even more tldr im just sad im feeling ashamed to tell my family and friends im gonna have to shut one of the outlets needed place to vent  friend of mine who is running kitchen only outlet also is suffering major loss these days no orders if no coupons are running he actually is now experimenting with starting new premium sounding brands with much higher pricing and than offering good discounts on the pricing same kitchen same food removed why is that happening to those of you asking run subway stores and another south indian outlet had to shut one of the subs the other one is barely making profit but that a good sign with how things are right now sorry to hear that don feel ashamed about anything it natural to feel despondent when you have to shut down your business all this up and down is part of life take your time and bounce back harder good luck what do you mean by swiggy zomato problems is it that people are spending less on all this sad to hear this small business owners such as you form the backbone of our economy hope you come back from this stronger m no one to tell you what you tell your friends and family but often ve found there simply no substitute for plain and simple truth businesses fail no need to take it personally they are close to you they understand best wishes for your future venture check out this thread for similar discussion from another restaurant owner such as you np reddit com indiainvestments comments dna alternate investment avenues any success stories fp feeling sad for you also disappointed by the fact that food outlet owners in india shows no innovation in creating menu am still not sure if this idea will bring any change in your work xb agree the impact of swiggy on businesses nope don do that zomato and swigy are just loaded kids if you need inspiration read sam walton made in america how this guy beat kmart who was giant at his time with his basic principal become customer oriented don add sell spoiled paneer and keep the hygiene up people will come by didn know the slow down has such direct affects but think zomato and swiggy have lot to do with this there are few udupi restaurants near my place and the only customers they get now are the loyal customers the owner of one of the restaurant frequent told me that he knows most of his customers by face name and his home delivery service is almost never called because of swiggy zomato since he operates on thin margins adapting swiggy and zomato would mean making losses which he doesn want to do lot of people that stumble upon these place do definitely become repeat customers just because of the friendliness of the owner the hygiene and taste but lot of people aren coming out of houses because food delivery service is cheap and more convenient another proper dine in restaurant near my house started pushing own coupons so everytime you order from swiggy they put leaflet in the packaging that requests the customer to order directly and get similar discounts this way he eliminating the need to pay swiggy think his discounts aren absolute discounts but free stuff or coupons that you can redeem in the next order not sure how it working out for him though apart from my first comment which gives idea on how to survive am just venting out as customer the reason people are going for zomato or swiggy is because they have people who listen to the customer in case of issue in the case of local vendor if you bring back the packed food and say its spoiled the shop owner show his big glare to the customer and make sure to remind that he is outsider in city and the shop owner is the local don people do not want cash back every time they complain they complain because they think you guys could fix that from next time as see the restaurants or streets they would be locked down if the fdi officer do their job properly so to all the ass ho are crying over the down economy and serving the same three days old samosa after re frying to customer your competition is not with swiggy or zommator your competition is to the millions of the home maker mothers and sister who can make nice and fresh meal in budget then you this is kind of unrelated but what are your profit margins instead of being quieter talk more about it right now country is not even realising we are in recession best of luck bro failure in entrepreneurship is nothing to be ashamed of learn lessons and move on out of the loop here how is zomato and swiggy fucking things had heard bad stuff about zomato gold from some restaurants but didn know kitchen only restaurants are also being hit what food do you guys sell sucks to hear hope your situation improves soon having said that restaurants that are able to compete in these difficult times are probably amongst the best ones in terms of customer satisfaction maybe you can look into why some are managing to survive the circumstances better than you millenials are just eating at home now curious you are making rs lakhs month how much do the zomato swiggy eat into your profit share from week to day the business must be doing good right sorry to hear it bro what kind of food did you sell hope shutting down this outlet will at least save you from losing more money what are these zomato problems have seen lot of restaurants with this what is the issue hey staying in context is there body that decides what restaurants should price their food at like have cap to max pricing and if price dish at bucks does it justify me selling it at that price am millennial avoid restaurants food outlets like plague prefer homemade food over any restaurant or food outlets d eat restaurant food in rare cases like hanging out with friends with unhealthy food habits why who the fuck know how you folks prepare the food do we even have hygienic conditions certified well im sure it can be bought with some bribing what kind of sub standard ingredients you might have used to reduce the price or increase your margins and for those zomato and swiggy where do get the food from from some ghost kitchens with no hygienic certifications or restaurants which send in left over food or delivery boys mishandling and tasting the food before delivering to me hope all my millennial fellows boycott these restaurants outlets like kfc mcdonalds and prefer home made fresh and hygienic food over these discounted swiggy or overpriced pubs rather spend my money on fresh handpicked vegetables and groceries than your quality home delivered food

nestle violates law in india conducts clinical trials on premature infants for baby food www nationalheraldindia com india nestle violates law in india conducts clinical trials on premature infants for baby foodnan dr monjoni mitra of medclin research is the trial and research director of the trial the five hospitals which participated in the research cloudnine hospital bengaluru institute of child health kolkata manipal hospital bengaluru sir ganga ram hospital new delhi and calcutta medical research institute kolkata are private institutions kishore kumar apurba ghosh ravi shankar swamy neelam kher and saugata acharyya were the doctors involved in these respective hospitals for the trials putting the names of the offending doctors and hospitals involved in the racket xpost this is worldnews and other subs name and shame nestle is the most evil corporation ever whenever there is thread on askreddit about evil companies nestle is always on the top sick dont know why im surprised fuck nestle how come no government is able to reign in nestle effectively maybe it too powerful as company nestle is kind of serial offender of company how the fuck do these fucking companies have the gall to do such shady stuff in india and not in us first johnson and johnson and now nestle breaking the law nestle has conducted clinical trials on premature babies in five hospitals on substitutes for breast milk in complete contravention of the infant milk substitutes act it was found by breastfeeding promotion network of india bpni on screening the trial registry of indian council of medical research icmr that nestle has sponsored research titled multicentric observational study to observe growth in preterm hospitalised infants the trial was conducted on premature babies between the age of weeks the objective of the study was to assess the growth and feeding intolerance in preterm infants one of the exclusions was that the infant could not be fed milk substitute within hours of birth but from the third day onwards the trial suggested that the infant could be given milk substitute instead of breast milk they are conducting these trials on premature babies it is extremely risky babies are most sensitive during this period what would have happened if anything went wrong with these babies asks amulya nidhi of swasth adhikar manch there no point posting this here and becoming outraged if you re not actively doing anything to boycott their products nestle board meeting ceo people hated the whole water isn a human right thing but we re losing steam on that story what can we do to stir the hate up even more he hungers for it he grows weary board member what about fucking with people dogs everyone loves dogs ceo hmm like it evil but we can go eviler m sure of it board member what about puppies those are baby dogs they re even cuter that ll really do it ceo this is progress maybe there an even cuter popu board member human babies we can fuck with human babies that ll really get the blood pumping deep cackle emanates from dark corner of the room board member low rumbling growl premature babies baby babies ceo yes perfect premature babies mister shkreli and mister beiber you re dismissed start rounding up sample cohort of premature babies cthulu and will stay here and work out the details these are the companies we need to boycott not zomato or snapdeal boycott nestle cross post this to hydrohomies they loathe nestle and can possibly make this news viral why is nestle suddenly violating laws in india is it looking to join bjp ok guess some proper information needs to be given here am medical prof who has done fair share of research across international papers and so can tell abt these studies and what is the actual problem first of all clinical trials on premature babies are done all the time observational studies randomized control trials are done occasionally and hence it is not barbaric these trials are done precisely to know whether the treatment options that we have are even worth it or not the substitute for breast milk is actually necessary especially when mother is not lactating and you need to feed breast milk to baby the suckling reflex hasn developed in premature baby and hence they need to be given from outside sometimes breast milk is just not available or is inadequate and hence substitute is absolutely necessary ok now comes this study first of all any study of such type is always done after ethical clearance and after consent from the parents this is true for all subjects of any study most probably there is case control study here where some premat babies are fed normal breast milk and some are fed with substitute milk and then the growth is seen after the result the subjects are always shifted back to standard therapy again consent is always taken now we say any nestle the thing which nestle did was break the law which said they cant give monetary or other benefit to healthcare provider nestle is company which is creating new product that is fine they have to get it tested in clinical trials that is completely fine as well the researchers have to do it in respective hospitals with proper place for premat babies and nicu etc etc that is fine as well however giving benefits to the researcher involved for skewed result that is not ok starting research before official ethical clearence certificate that is not ok basically if the wordings of this article are correct then the problem is that nestle is most prob hiring researchers on their own terms and hence the study isn exactly unbiased is it harmful to babies it depends really if they are shifted back to current gold standard of treatment after results and everything else is ensured see their exclusion criteria is pretty good then it won hurt them however is the results are skewed when they are actually not useful then it can be harmful for further babies who receive them in subsequent trials hence why unbiased research is really important in clinical trials so everyone hold your horses it is not as unethical as you are thinking they are not killing babies here nor are they doing something absolutely horrible however it does become unethical when it is forming an unbiased research that should be condemmned research is wonderful thing and we should do it unbiased to help everyone involved nowhere is any mention of penalizing the company is there any provision of penalty or prosecution for the company involved man nestle is fucked up and thought was being healthy by eating nestle products india is becoming the guinea pig for experiments of the western world do the parents know that their infant is part of such trials does the doctor or anyone else inform them ugh there real question should be what are we going to do about it congress mouthpiece is doing better journalism than many so called neutral outlets like republic m not even suprised tho nestle has reputation of going to third world countries and doing shit like this they are honestly evil how much evil shit can be leveraged over maggi noodles evil scum its hard but try my best to stay away from their products don they already have premature baby food pure evil kinda thought they would learn something after starving and infecting to death babies of perfectly healthy mothers nope they were just waiting for another unsuspecting people is there subreddit for the types of this post unrelated to topics what are substitute for nestle cerelax have baby am giving it as supplement food looks like patanjali about to launch similar products just giving baba headstart what the fuck just saw the trailer of tigers based on nestle campaign in pakistan in the www youtube com watch djxsiuvccum www youtube com watch

i started my btech degree yesterday at the age of  www reddit com india comments ciddbn i started my btech degree yesterday at the age of for those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor after the age of started my btech degree at the age of sure the indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn encouraged at such old age by societies standards but took the plunge here my backstory graduated high school in scored rank of in wbjee and took up chemical engineering at jadavpur university my father lost his job in due to mental illness and had passion for photography started working as freelancer photographer to meet ends couldn attend classes and by had backlogs decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn for me made some good progress in my photography career shot few promotional events with kareena kapoor ajay devgan govinda etc but opportunities became bleaker as didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by photography was totally failure people suggested me to go back and finish my degree my cousin sponsored my studies and went back to ju but hated chemical engineering depression happened and by mid had backlogs wasnt just simply interested in it took the year off to recover from my depression gave wbjee this year and now am starting btech in cse from tier college so by the time graduate will be really love front end web development at the moment so let see where the future leads me lot of you might ask why am going for bachelor degree could have learnt coding and got job in six months honestly there are no shortcuts in life wouldn want to be year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn have bachelor degree have seen lot of posts here by people who are and non graduates and they ask for help this is for those people even if society makes feel like failure don let your mind accept that because can change your past but you can plan and act in the present to build better future dwelling on the past won change anything saw lots of posts from people in their mid s to s on facebook job post groups where they took up job without going for graduation degree and now at much older age they are without any job and much options smart man learns from his own mistakes wise man learns from the mistakes of others don know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age but in usa people graduate even in their s age is just number don let society come in between your life and your dreams failure isn fatal success isn final it is the courage to go on that counts don let the past define you today is new day start again thanks failure at edit thanks for the gold edit thanks for the nd gold and rd silver much appreciated edit thanks for the platinum hope this post can give people new direction and courage don lose hope you aren alone edit thanks for the th silver have received lot of messages with similar problems to mine and asking for guidance if you are someone who is reading this and you are stuck in similar situation feel free to message me for any queries advice motivation  more power to you bro wish you all the best deleted is still an early age ve known lot of people who went to college in their s and are doing quite well just make sure you use what you learn and build useful things congrats on bouncing back also just remember that majority of indian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry unless you re lucky you ll mostly only end up with useless degree at the end of years just keep learning new things on the side and build few pet projects for your resume just my two cents you are an inspiration bro just one thing don wait for graduation to start earning money learn new things and start doing freelance work when was in college the schedule seemed so hectic that didn find any time to do anything apart from study and little sports but now in job realize had lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar do competitive programming contribute in open source pick relevant projects maintain good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies you have unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates don perspective changes with age and there more clarity on what to choose based on how much value it gonna add use that advantage you know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream so keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have that such an inspiring journey imo opinion failures are necessary for success those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements better late than never was feeling quite anxious today about my career and am just just graduated dropped ca picked up cfa now ve been applying for jobs and so far not much has happened was feeling defeated but guess we only lose when we stop trying more power to you to me and everyone who needs you ll land on your feet because you are willing to work and that what matters at the end of the day fellow front end dev here hit me up for any sort of help at any time please get scientific paper published by the end of your tech tech contribute to open source projects these are my suggestion good career awaits you you shall be inspiration for others and me let me know if can help you in any way good luck wish there is someway can reach out to you and hang out am also from ju started my undergrad in crappy engineering college at bangalore loved bangalore loved kannada people but hated engineering and the college grew up in jodhpur park right next to jadavpur university even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment think it was the chem engg dept but could be wrong you were probably in first year when was in pg did not face any of the adversities that you do not even half of them as read your post realized how privileged life have had none the less dropped out of engineering joined ju arts as much as people hate on ju arts they are the most liberal people have seen there was senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to ju arts and encourage them mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now anyways ju arts turned it around for me did decently there went onto get masters and then finally into phd which am hoping to graduate next year am now and ironically code for statistical analysis now had dropped out of cse engineering and the only difference is like what do now the moment read ju hoped ju would be the turning point for you just as it was for me but we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take ju is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as student is nothing but family don let people tell you what to do and how to do it have had really stupid people both in ju and mostly outside tell me that would amount to nothing because dropped out and because of my age bro started my phd at two students met in my cohort an american african woman aged white gentleman aged who had just retired from american army these two were older that most of the cohort which was by average years old and what bloody inspiration they were to the phd cohort phd cohort have pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go especially the econometrics paper while the lady was not that good at maths she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper they outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects ended up being really good friends with both of them in fact they are the closest friends have on campus so no age is honestly number and nothing else fight the good fight if you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out please reach out to me this was actually my last summer break here in the country and will be in philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything can help you with please reach out am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country and again fight the good fight am sure you will do great leave you with song that used to listen to when got depressed in ju about my career trajectory the song was an anthem for us dropouts pulak da wrote the song pulak da was from philosophy department and died in road accident thought you might like this www youtube com watch bvmqxfjtn it never too late to do anything good luck that some really inspiring material for someone who has done engineering and pursuing first year masters in psychology at the age of late bloomer but ll surely gonna have great career ahead wise man learns from others mistakes so here a mistake made that you could learn from in my graduation all did was try and pass exams did well in grades but in terms of learning or knowledge didn have much so had to go back to basics after my degree don do this please take keen interest in your classes curriculum and additional learning don be just literate be an educated person all the best more power to you bro sotti khub bhalo lagche eita porey hope you become really big in life thank you for inspiring us to work little harder it awesome you chose this for yourself never be ashamed to choose education especially when life takes away opportunities from you unexpectedly you had the chance to grow and you took it that a win in my book my father had taken up bsc in physics and chemistry when he was because my grandfather wanted that for him he had wanted to do tech right after his bsc degree but my grandfather passed away unexpectedly my father was financially burdened at yrs of age to take care of my grandmother and his unmarried sisters he could never pursue tech again and its his biggest regret in life don listen to society and do your own thing all the best shot few promotional events with kareena kapoor ajay devgan govinda etc but opportunities became bleaker as didnt have the money to expand on my equipments most of my photographer friends are facing this issue too they have tried to get endorsed by brands but only few succeeded tough career path anyways

state board took admission in tier college for botany at the age of feel like shit most of the time lots of advice went unheard from my side cuz wanted to do me tried not to keep regrets funny did ended up taking up bsc course that my dad said should ve taken wasted my time so feel ve failed them and my only option for me to make it up to them is to qualify some government exams hopefully upsc ifos but it scary in comparison to medical lookin for job prospect in botany cuz don know what too look where to look all ve ever seen botany graduate that they end up in teaching jobs and plus given my history and age might not be able to score some decent job everyone around me has completed their study doing job while m still studying it sucks well don know what future holds for me but meanwhile m focusing on what infront of me slowly building m still learning to believe in myself and trust my abilities rest leave upto universe dont know where it will but have gotta put effort into it sorry for any mistakes m not really good at grammar portion of english can just make sentences that make sense in my head due to financial conditions have to do teaching job after my masters and

kind of motivation badly all the best for the future this post needs an award proud of you brother it takes courage and can relate to this as have been going through similar phase all the best doing this requires courage am glad you shared your story this is inspiring all the best my brother is in the same boat as you are although he is just he qualified jee in but decided that engineering was not his cup of coffee and wanted to study law he tried those exams as well and got into decent college but years down the line he started questioning his decision he had interest in computer science as well and he used to code sometimes even when he was pursuing law now when he started to realize that law was not for him we discussed lot pros and cons of this decision and he decided he wants to pursue computer science so he started college yesterday best of luck bro fuck the society and go for what you feel is the best for you can so relate to the fact that it is expected to do all things in certain pattern and by certain age hope you succeed and do well this post is proof that you don need degree to be educated this post made my day wishing the best for you you re awesome well there a master candidate at my university who has daughter doing her bachelor best of luck friend indian society is full of fucking wankers forget about them and pursue what you desire the only opinions that matter are those of the ones you love nobody cares what the society thinks kudos for taking the plunge all the best kudos to you my man such an inspiring story too studied chemical engineering though not at it wasn for me either and ended up depressed took year off after bachelors and am gonna study physics now could learn thing or two from you keep up your spirit and fuck the naysayers you made my day つ bookmarking this best of luck in life bro congratulations to you for making such bold move to do what you are doing certainly requires courage you are an inspiration to the young generation that gives up their life over some petty issues and the society we live in is also kinda judgmental having said that you must be receiving support as well now that you are embarking on new journey of your life wish all the happiness and luck you go man ain no shame in pursuing what you want to good luck would say you could have done year bsc or bca instead of btech from tier college you could have saved some money and graduate degree one year early then again more power to you for doing something what you like great attitude man our society adds unecessary stigmas to everything just do what you are doing and don give fuck about what everyone else has to say takes courage to beat the cliche in this indian society and pursue what you love may the force be with you am happy for you good luck all the best that was perfect godspeed hope you are successful in all your endeavours you never failed you just got break so that the universe could mold you into better person and stop comparing apples with oranges it doesn help am glad that you never gave up don know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age but in usa people graduate even in their s that not valid comparison india education system is all handholding and spoonfeeding great going dude keep it up just applied for mba in correspondence there is no age to learning your doing the correct thing all the best bro first year is the toughest so focus on clearing them after that you can apply for internship job at local web development firms as your college is tier they won mind your job as their main concern is fees they ll let you attend job without problem am asking you do job is because industry experience is highly appreciated by mncs and also because tier colleges don provide the required guidance and are far away from realities of what going on in the industry all the very best bro all the best brother god bless you on your new path chutiya lodo pe dhyan na de god bless good

paying heed to what society says after all one has lost only when one gives up my friend who in europe currently for masters said it common to have students who are in masters even bachelor and nobody blinks an eye so unlike our indian society wish you all the best and hope we make the best out of our respective situations thank you so much for this recently changed my major in college to economics

sister was in th standards she was struggling every now and then to educate us and now we all are earning she wants to leave her job and pursue more education after reading your post it proved once

bengal are you bengali too bring future awaits my friend good luck bhalo laglo eta pore egiye jao bro man you just motivated me to prepare for neet again just as made up my mind to give up our life should not be scheduled according to our age as societal norms force us to do may you succeed in all your endeavors and m retard who took drop from th last year laugh at it now xdd but think whatever happened happened for reason now m completing th this year and boy the maturity feel now towards study is unmatchable by regular yr old th student man love seeing posts like this on this sub you are part of the new india which looks beyond judging people for things like going back to school good luck hope you enjoy what you do and never regret any of it just finished my first year of undergrad turned during it yes fucking cunties and cuntkles talk but fuck them man we got this all the power to you dude good to know there more of us around just want to say started school at after not so good now graduate next fall just keep with it make friends have fun its ok to have fun but don be stupid indian here in america am about to graduate with my bachelors at the age of definitely understand the pressure of not being graduated especially in the indian circles that mostly why choose not entertain the people who judge me those that mind don matter those that matter don mind ganbarimasu senpai m finishing it at your moto is your username have great college life bro best of luck to you man depression is one hell of thing to get through stay strong buddy you ve got photography basics clear use that to be developer who writes code with design sense example coding for apps about photo filters even courses like image processing from electrical department would help or more generically even front end designing could be your thing you don necessarily need to take it as fresh start use your past more avenues will be visible once you connect these things being master dropout think m able to learn more without college also saving on money if that a factor yes job hunt will get difficult which is why make coherent story you got curious about designing while being photographer and decided to work on that skill still given that you have different pace way no need to get more societal validation in form of degree save that course money and spend it on your own thing because you re picking cse this particular skill can be easily learnt from internet m almost saying why give more chance to education system that failed to empathize first time however much you think it was your fault it wasn the system is still the same use your time to do plenty other things in the world deleted doing my post graduation at the ripe age of can totally relate feel like fish out of water other than what your studies get into the open source world start understanding programming concepts try building some stuffs on your own post them to github rinse and repeat for any help related to programming or web development in general you can reach out to the below communities webdev programming learnprogramming have finished both my gold and silver else this would have been my proud gilding all the best brother am cse graduate from tier private college in kolkata and trust me when say this the placement scenario here is not at all good largely due to the quality of faculty and poorly structured wbut makaut curriculum which in turn translates to poor quality students hence do not rely on college placements if you re interested in coding and comp sci in general explore outside the curriculum be active on hackerrank spoj explore ml blockchain contribute to open source projects and so on doing so would help you make it to the bar of the top product companies which pay much better and have lot better work than the mass recruiting companies that hire from these colleges deleted you are actually in quite an envious position you are much more mature than the other graduates you know the world out there so don think you would be negligent in your studies would say go give it your all and all the best s would suggest you get started on your studies now it would be really easy to score an awesome job right after graduation of you start now pick up competitive programming or anything try freelancing try out everything that a great achievement wish you more bright days in life fuck indian society deleted m an engineering dropout ve missed out three years there can totally feel you bro love and support you ll be doing great for sure keep boosting up went to college after year gap after my th and had lot of apprehensions about it so can only imagine what you re going through but over period of time met lot of people and post an initial period of judgment which think was more of me being ashamed of my gap than those who was meeting for the first time ever made some of my best friends who made the years some of the best of my life long story short it gonna be epic good luck 
watching movies in india is truly unique experience  www reddit com india comments dcqkjk watching movies in india is a truly unique seriously there is no dearth of weird shit that can happen went to watch joker in an afternoon show and here is list of things that happened some guys came with heath ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks they were denied entry because they didn have id to prove they were above this bunch of joker anarchists was then seen begging the security to let them in overheard guy was telling his girlfriend that heath ledger would make cameo in this movie thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced another group of people who had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater they were asked to shut up by the ushers these same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of iconic clips from the movie sometimes with their flash on thankfully they were thrown out someone family member apparently died hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call he ran out after few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not spotted celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography was contemplating throughout the movie what will say to him or will he be cool to take picture with me etc had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out as was about to talk to him he and his wife started having an argument just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardness thoughts about the movie it great just try going for show where you can avoid the college crowd dunno why these people worship the joker  we live in society is the photographer auditya of audi photography by any chance remember watching the dark knight in theater it was mostly empty and my friends were kinda making fun of me for watching comic book movie from that to heath ledger face painted joker anarchists am kinda glad sounds like fun night aur ek main hun jo war chala gaya sorry dosto joker ke english subtitles nahi they apun partially deaf hai deleted is the film cursed or what everyone going there is having troubles nah nah think the cinema is cursed or maybe op is considering this many unfortunaties happening in one go removed holy shit all of those in single show where is this hahaha here what experienced yesterday watching the movie dude in front of me got huge popcorn bucket and well he annoyed me throughout the movie in this brooding serious movie bunch of guys and girls howled whistled and clapped when arthur fleck finally got the joker makeup and then when he got the bloody smile felt like was watching sallu bhai movie girl behind said after the movie ended dc waale bahut weird movie hi banate hai no hate it when people start making videos of movie to upload to their insta status no one kin cares what movie you are watching unless it mia khalifa comeback video playing in imax no it can legit happen to anyone anywhere in the world but people need to learn the courtesy of going out before taking calls or put the frikkin thing on silent and enjoy the movie bet bollywood might also like this whenever go to watch cgi fest at the multiplex keep hearing audience on the way extolling how christopher nolan is the greatest film director ever basic human empathy tells you not to say shut up to someone who is clearly going through sudden emotional trauma imagine yourself in his shoes other than that haha dunno why these people worship the joker it the kind of people who don get the message from the movie it not just joker though although he is definitely the biggest idol for the incel culture on the internet these people also think rorschach tyler durden travis bickle etc were the good guys in their movies what the fuck but you know what ve watched movies in some shady ass neighborhoods of north america and some of this applies to those cinemas as well

 serious am stuck with my career and could use some guidance on what to do next am genuinely lost  www reddit com india comments cmt serious i am stuck with my career and could use this is long post and cannot tl dr it because need to explain my situation sorry about that xb so am year old who is graphic designer by profession have been in this domain for years and can say am alright at it am definitely not extremely good but the last two places worked they were genuinely happy with my work got into this field in weird way always liked to tinker with digital art photography etc and got job as designer straight out of college since then have worked in this field because thought it was my passion and it was the only thing could do to pay my bills the more worked in this field the more began to dislike graphic design over time it became more of chore for me that when realized am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because have been in it for while and have some sense of design for example when was working with few brands just wanted to get the project over with so can have some peace of mind there was lot of room for improvement but didn suggest it because more work for me in the same train of thought am more than happy to be told what to do and will do it many passionate designers met are completely against that idea they want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve but for me it just another deadline that needs to be done with also realized if have to compete with top designers to get better jobs have to improve my skills now would happily do it if was genuinely passionate about it but know am not xb quit my last job in june and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out since june was so happy that don have to wake up and do this shitty job still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that when realized began hating my hobbies because of this job am old now to understand this passion and drive cannot cultivate in this field for sure now have to look for job realistically can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with amazon have already worked with them or some other corporate where could get paid decent amount etc but am feeling will go back to hating my life and work again am okay with boring to job even if it is some mind numbing work as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent don expect the perfect life anyways but feel need to change this xb can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect should just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when am not passionate about it feel the only way can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself but to do that need to genuinely love the work which don if not what other options do have some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has scope of me to go abroad which is long term plan for me feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it not that sought after field with which can move abroad xb if you would suggest stay in graphic design are there any schools or courses that can help me am fully self taught designer so have never had proper foundation of design sense and style had helpful mentor in my last job and he kept telling me don go for studies in this field just keep working and you will improve learned lot from him in terms of my work improving and all other than this are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest xb any help would be appreciated thanks  am graphic designer too and can relate to that thing you said where you started hating designing casually because of your job have come to that point that nowadays am like why put so much thought into this just get it over with about your mentor talking about not studying he is partly right in sense that you will mostly learn about software and shit more in institutes in india but have heard top colleges like nid and all actually helps you improve but dunno how exactly am also in very similar boat as you where would just want to get over with the work that is assigned to me without thinking much and shit realized this follow your passion route is pointless when you have no proper passion only one of my friends who is as passionless as me is working as ui ux designer at mckinsey in chennai his work is truly pathetic for someone of his experience but he gets paid some to times more than me has fixed hours and weekends off was thinking of taking that job up because like you don care about passion and all anymore but right now cannot make move to chennai so that out hope you find solution to this issue graphic designer here my nd job now in one of biggest automobile industries in world get you completely get you how you ve been bored by your job but it can be said about any other job graphic design is tough if you re in ad agency you re fucked they pay lot but your timings will be almost hours work excluding travelling m talking about proper ad agency who works for big brands go in finance sector finance companies are in need of good graphic designers they pay well and don have lot of creative demand most of the designs are simple we have launched new schemes with barely bullet points among the many choices available for graduate engineer with work experience it would be wise to avoid confusion and pursue career in any of the original job forms design art and the creative aspect myself pursue writing as career and feel the need to learn and explore in order to continue to be relevant in the job market this is true for most of the tech jobs the level of commitment invested in your salaried job is paid off as monetary benefits and will help you lead routine all jobs in general that ask for presence and desk deliverables within stipulated frame or schedule are sure to cause burn out or at least some symptoms such as tiredness uneasiness it is of utmost importance that we identify these symptoms and plan break leaves accordingly on continuing to work with the industry we should first accept the terms and adhere to disciplined lifestyle planning off work routine and staying committed to contractual obligations requires intense practice for now practice working on new skills try for suitable opportunities and present yourself freely discuss openly regarding your requirements and if the job is interesting it is going to be good deal how about trying other fields of design maybe interior design or something dude work is work you do if only for money and status didn mix up passion and work just get your work done asap in that you can do whatever the fuck you re passionate about in the extra hours op would suggest not giving up completely on graphic design because you seem to have passion for it it seems more like you are jaded with the job description and would suggest looking at pivoting to something graphic design related but which lines up with your interests workflow better maybe you could try web design learn basic html and try out ui ux development these are skills you can learn to competent level just from resources available freely on the internet courses in graphic design in india are mostly only learning different software tools to use etc and doubt you ll find course that would actually teach basic design concepts well unless you get into nid for example try and figure out what kind of content you enjoy making and focus on it and as always make sure you have regularly updated portfolio of your work ready for show if people ever ask for it personal website is great way to do this and if you like the web design idea you could set personal portfolio website as your first learning project

broke up what next  www reddit com india comments alpdh broke up what next hi everyone browse through reddit quite bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships life so here goes my story little about myself m yr old indian woman working in it and earning well am the only kid and my mother raised me as single parent after my dad left us she has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other indian families had my share of relations when was young and was single for considerable amount of time in mid and made good use of it started traveling and over years have come to love it travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say am decent at both being single also taught me value of friendships and m fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years met my bf yrs two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together as we started talking about future realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business agriculture he mentioned it casually once yr ago had no idea he was serious about it refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to place which has zero opportunities for career hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances for the reasons above and also that would be giving up all my friends leaving my mom work travel everything for one person seemed like bad deal we tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup this breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything want to stop feeling negative about my ex somewhere feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for yrs and stop feeling sad for myself am scared that might end up alone given the age taboo caste etc in india and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head any suggestions are welcome thanks ablahnaari xb xb  chill dude no need to worry it better to be alone than with someone with whom you re not comfortable living by yourself has its own advantage you have time is not that old get back out there when you are ready don blame yourself or your ex if you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise if it had to end its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later give it some time and re evaluate feelings always clouds reality everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens time heals most wounds if you let it stay positive am years old have never been in relationship no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons yet keep faith while also keeping fit enjoying my life finding new interests and try to travel as much as can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and society last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards love has no sell by date you mentioned you love to travel do more of it its great distraction plan trip in the near future travel has healing and transformative powers wish you all the best the dude lived in the city for years and wants to go farm let him he seems passionate about it don hold him back as for you you are too young to be worried about what gonna happen to you take it easy and move on you have no idea what in store that ablanaari shit was funny though am scared that might end up alone given the age taboo caste etc in india and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head stop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself better person pickup some new hobbies hang out with your friends or try making new ones have to admit that have not travelled as much as you did but my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home you will get better solution as am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems lpt just talk to as many people as possible find new things to do the less you sit and ponder the better it ll be give it time and then ponder and let go live life forward not backwards you took the right longterm decision the blaming bitterness and sadness for few months is common convince and coax your mind that you took good positive long term decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned express your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way for me writing them in detail in diary worked but if you re not into writing record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself or if you have close friend who a good listener express it in front of them don know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps but it does as for fear of society most people don bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite bit d suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons such as love and companionship and never for negative or shallow reasons such as fear reputation social status take it from o guy who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love xb smoke joint let go off things and start afresh ain too old you still have good years before you settle down goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget something just broke up its very normal to hate your ex even if he she hasnt done anything horrible xb be kind to yourself im not believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me what are you going through is grief its the same feeling as you would feel if loved one died you probably already know the stages of grief you are going to go through all of it not in sequence but in circles give yourself time and be kind to yourself xb trust me went through this im not out yet but am million times better than what was immediately after curious question is the word abla or ablah know certain indian demographic ppl like to add around their s but cmon why here am pretty sure the actual word is abla thankhs

is this the future  www reddit com india comments edwjr is this the future  sumit was adjusting his position in the bus sweating in the heat he saw his friend shweta shift beside him they were just returning from their official trip from mumbai back to delhi the bus had picked them up from the airport sumit was explaining to shweta about how good the movie was while he was explaining he was simultaneously watching the road he had view of the road ahead he spotted two suvs parked across the road as if to block it he saw half dozen people standing in front of it his heart skipped beat his body stiffened and shweta felt it what wrong she asked nothing just give me minute he said he kept looking around and found seat beside another girl in the back he immediately got up you should move there he said pointing at the empty seat okay you re just acting weird now why should move she asked in high pitch don ask questions please just go there he said as he grabbed her hand and almost forcefully lead her to the seat he only had moment to look at her face and he felt bad okay ll explain everything later just don worry sit tight and you ll be fine he said she pulled him back standing midway between the seat they were sitting in and the seat he had chosen they felt the bus slow down further she had to hold on to the rails on the ceiling m not going anywhere until you tell me what going on she hissed sumit looked around and while some were staring at what was soon appearing to be mob blocking the road some were staring at them sumit figured he still had some seconds before they got in he grabbed her hand and took her to the seat they had been sitting in we don have time but this is the issue m circumcised they look like rss mobs and they normally check the guys for this if they see that you re with me they ll assume you are muslim too ll manage it okay he whispered to her shweta took few moments to register what she just heard while she saw sumit face turn scarlet they were good friends but this was detail about that she didn know if she wanted to hear shweta just go he hissed but at the same time wondering what she was thinking no why should leave you to fend for yourself please ll tell them that you re with me that you re my family they no they are going to check all the men anyway there no point he interrupted her they heard voices and he forcefully grabbed her hand and took her to the other seat he ran back to his and shweta could see his back was stiff she was crying but realised that she couldn do anything at this point she saw two men barge inside the bus with wooden clubs and she could even see knife handles from the knives tucked into their pants one man was remarkably tall with thick beard and had saffron towel around his neck the other man was of average height and clean shaven if you cooperate this will be over quickly and you can be on your way m saying it now don create trouble the smaller of the two men announced all the men come outside the tall man roared so loud that shweta flinched she knew what this was going to be she felt huge pang of guilt her instinct of self preservation took over nothing could be done she thought five minutes later she counted men come back they were one short she didn see sumit come back she felt the bus lurch forward and she immediately ran to the driver my friend isn back yet please don leave already he must be out there she screamed he not coming back beta he replied calmly no no he will come back she screamed at the top of her voice in desperation she then collapsed to the ground next to the driver howling the year is in new delhi hindustan if you re reading this from the past you ll notice that it not called india any more it all started in the bharatiya janata party bjp won huge mandate and were lauded for their pro development policies before tell you what happened let me tell you what else is going on with hindustan what sumit and shweta went through is just one instance this is happening everywhere they can check women but they check men if they re circumcised if they are the women they are with are also taken the government is condemning this albeit very mildly and of course the pm keeps tweeting how sad he is and urges not to engage in violence the government keeps insisting that they have no hand in this but it is the work of miscreants that they aren able to control starting with the protests that erupted in the erstwhile india at the end of it soon emerged that the bjp after winning their second election with landslide were now enacting their core ideologies in social media narendra modi always appeared to be man who treated everyone equally however it was in rallies that his actual persona could be seen millions watched helplessly as he brainwashed thousands every week the bjp realised that all they needed was to brainwash the gullible to tell them that hinduism was under threat that our country was going to the muslims muslims were accused so many things the economy bad they blamed it on them they accused muslims of impersonating hindus to get away and practice their religion secretly this rumour became more widespread when muslims were left stateless after the national registry of citizens was introduced in so many protested but turns out they weren enough protests weren the only thing required people needed to un brainwashed people needed good pair of spectacles to see clearly the hard truth was the number of people who believed in hindutva outnumbered the others and this kept bjp in power the bjp knew all they had to do was campaign in rural areas and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in india  beautiful if anyone thinks that this just random art of fiction then just go back years behind the time and tell people that years from now there will be mob lynching on the basis of people seeing cow in vehicle and the driver is lynched back then people would have laughed at this fiction but now we know its not fiction anymore same goes for the above post no modi in anyway it could happen holy shit you had me in the first half was fuming and was fearful at the same time not sure whether modi would be around till let alone after see shah being the pm candidate but if we can defeat them in election then yeah totally agree those days will come edit hadn read the title before and thought this incident actually happened all they had to do was campaign in rural areas and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in india would like to read something on how bjp other rw is more powerful in rural areas over urban areas 
as an nri my personal view on the serious emigration thread  www reddit com india comments ddozc as an nri my personal view on the serious here is the original thread old reddit com india comments dcquo serious emigration threat is it helpless yet as person emigrated to germany want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to india tl dr won be back as of now may be in future long version ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved infrastructure come from hyderabad and being capital city the infrastructure is shit it took more than years and massive amount to build metro and that too it over the top metro not an underground the roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads congesting it even more the city sewage is still from the nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it every year in rainy season roads and buildings are submerged in water ride bike for one hour take clean cloth and swipe on your face black layer come off that the pollution in the city auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust you are literally breathing that shit day in day out just creating better transportation does not make place livable you need to plan for the future and build something sustainable there is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle every year when visit hyd regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke please make the city more livable yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in aarey park mumbai to make way for metro we need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round it takes just strong will to inspect make every person riding vehicle to follows correct emission standards healthcare healthcare is completely different topic last year as challenge to get an mri for my cervical spondylosis problem my father asked me to get it done in osmania hospital visited for days and tried to get an appointment with neuro doctor and mri without paying bribe sadly gave up and got it done in private hospital have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital if you don puke would congratulate you imagine women carrying child for months and then delivering among other women in congested room and pathetic conditions healthcare is literally on their knees did you know years back indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them you know what can be done just good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems academics the plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to delhi govt kudos to them for bringing awareness private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds govt has no money to run schools but they make k crore statue saw some days back in up school was serving rice with salt as mid day meal are we in such fucking pathetic situation that we can not give curry dal with rice for our future generations don get me started on quality of education why can govt schools have english subject why do they have to teach only in regional language saw many govt school students under confident when they start college in germany can study for free until my pg can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if do research you know what as student pay just inr for one semester months and can take part or play as many times open the following link with chrome and translate it hsp hh sport uni hamburg de sportangprogramm htm it would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports you would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to germany played so many sports you can even imagine and that too almost free you can also take as many courses you want by paying k inr for months when you earn more then k every month for months is nothing why would leave this and come back to nothing where can get sick just by breathing that shitty air policies check out the startup culture here in berlin and munich area in india we have so many iit and lakhs of students graduating every year what is stopping the govt from creating startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh ideas they have startup fund and guess it has gone to the wind me my elder brother and younger sister all are cs students we are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in germany and branch out in india do you know why because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome every city has startup hacks meetups pitches don want to start our startup in the red tape of indian bureaucracy to be honest it a shame that in country like india we are lagging behind in startup world employment better startup policies better infrastructure better education directly leads to creating more opportunities no magic wand am in my s and working on my company there are lakhs of people like me but sadly working that shitty job in some big company just look around and see the jobs created by zomato and swiggy the cash they brought into market from consumers imagine startups like these on massive scale it would change the face of our country our economy needs to be more open and welcoming my brother used to work in east asia and came back to india and he regrets every day the daily commute traffic jams pollution is literally killing him as the first comment from mrfreeze says there are two types of people who emigrate better pay lifestyle and better work emigrated because of both you know its illegal to make me work on sat sunday if an exceptional situation arises that have to work on saturday my company has to get permission from labour office get weeks of paid holidays public holidays can travel countries just pack your bags and hop in your car los geht i get pr after working for years or years with german b certificate no shitty visa issues like in us of i can become german citizen in years can take

my whole family is covered under my health insurance covering from fever to cancer children go to awesome schools here to learn they can take music as subject or any sport and all of this is free if ever got fired get arbeitslosengeld job loss money for years guess better infrastructure better health and hospitals better care better money better air lastly guess this was written by non muslim person sorry to bring in religion as muslim myself my father urges me not to come back to india ever given the cancer that has spread in recent years have desis saying to my face anti national or paki here in germany and least expect that india stopped going to indian festival gatherings here because fear some dickhead will ask why came there and what is my intention some years back could trust my fellow indians and now lost that hope just for reference check this tweet twitter com rohini sgh status this is the cancer our country has acquired you don know the humiliation we are facing these days every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery the current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement what minority appeasement muslims situation is worse than sc st and that too without reservation why would leave all these and come back to india to suck all that shit love my country and think of it now and then but do miss it nah do miss the culture absolutely yes do want to come back and live there nope sorry edit thanks kash if for the silver edit if anyone needs help with any issues like job education just message me would be happy to help  awesome answer dude you ve put every point so precisely and there no counter to any of that but why would come back to the place d give my answer to this because am one of the few people who understand these issues because have power to solve one of these issues atleast to tiny extent because india sucking is as much fault of the knowledged staying silent as that of the stupid ruling the roost bollywood answer alert because it is my place how many ever years stay in any country wouldnt be considered as localite wouldn be able to say that this is my country you said you are and you have been in germany for years did you go there for your bachelors degree if yes was the education free for bachelors also why doesn germany have provision that parents of german immigrant citizens can also get german citizenship like canada also how is the treatment of muslims in germany cause heard the right wing is getting stronger there re indian mangoes banned it was eu wide www livemint com politics fmxwwnqzclzjvaogyhgi eu agrees to lift import ban on alphonso mangoes html there was also ban on some vegetables which remained in place same reason too much pesticide there have been similar alerts in the uae www thenational ae uae uae alert over pesticides in food from india and even the indian press has published stories timesofindia indiatimes com city hyderabad chemical concoction pesticides in veggies and fruits harm hyderabad children articleshow cms about it indians feel like people owe something to you indians take things personally like comment here service would be considered as help and refused when service is refused you know what it means fortunately service isn interpreted as help and thus not refused as much as it is in india abroad ve noticed this and that just my two cents the mentality of the people should change hyderabad doesn have gez fee germany has nice post and agree with you currently living in south east asia and always want to move to europe because of various reasons but the salaries and the taxes always make me think interesting read op am curious what is the status of racism against brown people in germany considering the fact that there been sudden inflow in refugees over the past two years also how long did it take you to get fluent in german deleted hi as someone living in germany for quite some while and familiar other parts of europe as well which countries do you see having well established or booming it tech industry at the moment in the near future also in terms of quality of life ease of integration emigration and racial attitudes and in general the culture how would you rank these countries asking because m looking at emigrating to europe as an option and would love to know your perspective ok it seems like you re having really good time in germany and your quality of life is extremely well m happy for you for that you ve risen out of the struggles of india and found some peace and breathing room in more stable place good for you mean that now is it possible for you to return to hyderabad permanently and still find way to sustain yourself and those that depend on you financially considering you re techie there is good enough market for software developers here so think that is possible if so what is stopping you from doing that the reason m asking this is because you seem like an above average and sharp person you ve also had experience abroad which lot of people do not have here with all that in mind your perspective and passion will be invaluable and the same goes for your siblings if you re this passionate about your country while staying abroad imagine what you could do for your country your city or even just your locality if you were living here so why aren you here one reason could be that you really aren financially stable enough to shift here and that ok if that not the case then the only reason left is that your passion is misplaced you are only worrying about your home because you feel like you should or because you have family living there when in reality you ve subconsciously accepted your new home in germany it either that or something else that explains why you re not in india trying to help with these problems you ve mentioned see all m hearing from your post is please make the city more livable plea coming from non resident indian who will never go through the difficulties of achieving that goal because he doesn and won live here but expects the locals to do so and inshallah we will do so but not to set up cushions for you but to furnish our own cities your post implies that us citizens are wilfully producing and promoting this black shitty air that you mention when in fact just in case you didn know we don want this air just as much as you actually we don want it more than you because we have to breathe it every day this if nothing else keeps us motivated to change that and since we are living here we can directly try to change that so you can see why rant about our shitty cities can sound hypocritical to our ears when we re trying to fix things here and someone who has just about none of dog left in the race tells us to make the city more livable it sounds very condescending like rich merchant asking the poor peasants to hurry up and stop being poor we re trying and when say you in this post mean to point to every nri that rants about the situation in india but hasn contributed to anything significant to help with it do miss it nah do miss the culture absolutely yes do want to come back and live there nope don know why wrote all this you ve said it yourself you only want the good parts without having to have worked to remove the bad parts also don know why you re worried about coming to hyderabad as muslim m not the most politically educated but even can tell you that hyderabad is possibly the safest place for an indian muslim to live in particularly hyderabadi muslim if you don believe that then either m wrong or you ve just proven how out of touch you are with your culture ppcontentrobot www reddit com user ppcontentrobot wouldn disagree with anything you are pitch perfect on what wrong in the country and wouldn blame you for choosing better quality of life wish could just raise wand and change the way things work in our country but unfortunately just can so came down here and asked the world what wrong and how we can influence change jingle bells wasn cut out for what came back if there is one thing am sure of it is of the fact that we just can keep doing this forever things around emigration will change drastically in the next decade and it will no longer be cut out for everyone wish we don have to wait till we get hit to reform change but you will always be foreigner there and never feel truly part of the country despite having citizenship not to mention the huge rise in anti immigrant sentiments in europe which although brought about by mass immigration from syria and africa will also threaten to sweep up well educated foreigners like you the sad truth is india is destined for mediocrity democracy is holding it back as it is susceptible to vote bank politics and nothing ever gets done china also has lots of different ethnic minorities although not as many as india and the reason they managed to do so well was because of an authoritarian leadership india inability to get grip with the population explosion is contributing to much of this misery we will have the same population as china by despite only having the land mass we are extremely polluted due to this population density and it is said there will be major water crisis in the future more than of our population is in agriculture this is completely unacceptable and farming should have been heavily mechanised by now and the people moved to manufacturing or something like that all this because crap politicians will keep their grip on power by gaining the votes of uneducated lower castes who can easily be convinced the smart indians will always view going abroad as the ultimate dream because they know india is beyond saving it easy to avoid dirt and walk away but it takes guts to step into the mess and clean it but can you get chai from tapari in germany from my experiences in europe and latin america prefer life in india yes it has its hassles but everything is pretty accessible here and affordable to everyone am not denying the downsides but would like to list out something that we want to overlook for greener pastures nothing to boast but find the holiday structure of govt opportunities here pretty neat and more public holidays private sector sucks yes can travel states as diverse as schengen nations just pack your bags and hop in bus or train you don even need car even to go to the remotest part no need for any language certificate to be anywhere or work anywhere free movement don know whether would want to be another citizen don know about as many but its pretty neat here too yup no paternity leave here exists here too children can play with other children and go to good schools as well might not be as extensive as there in curriculum yes think you pay much more tax too for social security but way def positive not great at infrastructure but hospital and care are def good in my state the only place felt like settling in was urban brazil felt like dev version of india with the most diverse and welcoming people have ever met very interesting response its your choice as to where you want to stay hyderabad versus germany but want to ask what are the laws about spitting and littering in germany did you educate your family and friends in hyderabad about them can you have religious functions in germany shouting slogans in the street can mosque have loudspeakers blaring azaan times day can you set up slaughterhouse on eid and slaughter goats in the name of religion in germany can you stand and say am an immigrant and muslim in germany did you know that the pollution you are complaing about comes from vehicles and people attempt to pay bribes to get puc certificates try that in germany too can you get fake degrees in germany like in hyderabad can you come out after friday prayers and pelt stones there can you tamper with your electric meter have lived in hyderabad and several cities in india yes things are not hunky dory and perhaps lots of things can improve some of us are trying to improve but you chose to leave and go away to germany and that fine if you don want to return to india in to years please don just don lecture us about how much germany is better keep in mind that if the far right takes power in germany you ll be the first one demanding for ticket on the flight back to hyderabad all of these luxurious things you mentioned are available in germany because of under population and plentiful resources jobs that is how things were in most developed countries us is case in point generation ago once the population increases and competition for jobs intensifies things will swing to the other extreme and quickly remember the country you are boasting about has very bloody history of discrimination and not too long ago either itna nafrat toh yaha post kyyu karte ho india should stop leaning into nris as victims indians living in india are victims farmers students graduates patients average earning consumers when will we stop catering towards whats happening to brown looking people in america as an indian living in india don fucking care if you are fucked in usa dhobi ka kutta na ghar ka na ghat ka your sorry ass will ignore this statement as well so fuck you and your anti india minds just to fill your purpose indians must and should never help you our indian health care is fucked and has gone way down because indian born doctors in us study from india and performs rectal exam of some white crack head hillbilly just because his skin is white and beautiful he never will chose to do the same for indian sewer cleaner the color makes huge difference hence the health care is worst and people in india die everyday unlike america cuz indians are always there to cure white people in exchange of dollars fuck your immigration issues d rather have an hardworking illlegal bangladeshi or pakistani in india than discussing or worring about your sorry ass in usa or germany for nothing 
guys am disappointed in the way we exploit the poor people of india  www reddit com india comments ebrc guys i am disappointed in the way we exploit the we see poor people everywhere in this country sometimes right in front of some extremely rich and posh areas we see beggars trying to get meal day in front of the same malls where we throw away half of the expensive mall food we eat we move to countryside same case thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them government schools that barely educate them social welfare policies that are worth billions that won even cover their most basic of the needs huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as home billions in medicine that won even help curing most common ailments enormous quantities of ration that isn even the fraction of what is needed all of that because they are born in the wrong place to the wrong families in the wrong castes etc it just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done the resources that could be utilized properly am extremely disheartened watching all this guys very very disappointed of such inefficiency in exploitation mean what the hell are we thinking wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement like we could use it to make sport where we throw it into river or something or just put all that on the ground and dance on it maximizing enjoyment factor all that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for fist full of food but then kill them anyway instead of wasting all this electricity and technology to apparently elevate these people you know what we can do giant machines machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass we hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts think about it we can use this butt currency to improve our economy place bets in the death matches etc our country is going to be trillion dollar economy in few months imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that we we could be like self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto mean seriously think about this it is much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now just my two cents join me in supporting for humane and prosperous india lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy by locking up the poor only poor illiterates count  apparently of the population is below poverty line that is they live by dollar day lot of time we don see them because we live in bubble your security guards and waiters mostly come from bihar and ne and there are much lesser jobs our countrymen do its the middle class that is getting the in india was that an attempt at mocking the underprivileged lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy by locking up the poor only poor illiterates count our country is going to be trillion dollar economy in few months wrong fact just get one thing straight it doesn matter however targeted programmes you run there is only one way to remove poverty that is is rapid economic growth rising tide lifts all boats you may not want it but the country needs more mukesh ambani so that they can employ millions and thus there is some hope for some people just see chinese example they didn care about people opinions they picked them from villages provided them jobs housing medical and thus created chain of people coming out of abject poverty though am well aware this can be implemented in india deleted hi so feel the same way you can really change generations of class divide however change yourself treat everyone with respect say thank you and sorry to watchmen chefs and walters and try not to disturb them too much just be kind and understanding to all try not to dress too fancy all the time remember the zeros on the left side of your net worth matter alot but after while the zeros on the right and side matter less try to live humble life never waste food or try to do so if possible try to use public transport and just be nice person who doesn show off his or her money or parents money just don give money in charity but time also by volunteering for cause you think you are good at you don know how many lives you cand drastically improve indirectly get confused with the term poor people offlate at least majority of those who qualify under the poor people category in cities don really fall under this group as they earn really well but in unaccountable ways aka without any taxation how they spend their money is different matter though most of these poor people earn hand full in cities or don earn because they are lazy and not because of lack of opportunities feel every time get exploited by these poor people rather than exploiting them it starts with almost everyone who fall into this bpl category and they will try to extract as much as possible from you or cheat you or want to get away with half baked work take your maid auto driver road sweeper vegetable seller construction worker etc etc etc just this evening am fooled with poor quality apples in spite of paying the amount he asked for it ps am specifically referring to these fake poor people in cities and not the real poor mostly outside big cities towns who struggle to meet ends inspite of hard work

corporate world hate everything there feel don fit in there also have mental health issues diagnosed with borderline depression and few others under therapy but it long term have tinnitus which kind of keeps me irritated lot really want to quit everything go on solo trip all over india just be by myself and read completed first year ma philosophy have over books that am yet to read want to read more both fiction as well as academic intrested in fields like history philosophy economy public policy psychology etc may be write about things learn but need money too let say rely on my parents for feeding me and we have house so rental income can give me x food but need to make some money for starters therapy needs money travel will need money at least some money am trying to paint and that needs money how do make money was thinking of doing sc psychology and sc etc and getting into practice so can handle counseling sessions that could source of income don know how much it will help in india what else can do with borderline it really getting difficult with relationshipz don think am ready for relationship and am not doing to get married with so much instability in my life let just think about me person want to earn something at my pace to meet my needs what are my options am mba in finance was also thinking of becoming fee only financial advisor aasan ideas for weaken fb group actually do financial advice etc for friends and colleagues am not dumb have cleared cat can teach kids for that take tuition am really confused what should do hate everything sorry for the rant well you sound like you desperately need vacation to get your head sorted try to take weeks off before quitting to come up with atleast small plan to see what you want to do that the only suggestion that can give so ll tell you how it all works out am no mba neither am some iit but quit my decent paying job moved back home first and eventually phased out of my job just get about k coz in my free time help dad manage some shit was actively working on starting something of my own been about months and nothing has yet worked out read lot but that too has fizzled out coz now am bored of books or frustrated in general and now am more focused to getting back to earning want to travel but that hasn worked great k month is insufficient for the entire month so went for trek to utharakhand paid in flight tickets to delhi train was about guess and for the trip stay was with friends and food was taken care so saved there planned hampi trip it supposed to be cheap vacation from the place live but then have other important expenses like my health insurance didn have it until last year and then got admitted into hospital for days and ended up paying more than lakh my mom root canal cost me k you ll have to ensure your teeth are proper those buggers are money sink you getting the idea assuming you living in your home town now let see you ll have friends and they ll surely want you to chill with them they will be earning once in while you will have to go out with them obviously don want to end up alone coz you pinch money one outing will set you back about k if you drink in my city these are expenses and lifestyle you don imagine and considered it easy do not you have expenses you have bills you need good passive income to sail you through again it ll be call you ll have to take lifestyle same rakhna hai ya scale down karna hai for similar lifestyle need about k month to survive but this is no savings this is bills travel and basic comfort oh ya your parents are getting old so those expenses are something you need to keep in mind too even if they have saved some for themselves as an indian am assuming you ll be there and take responsibility what the trade you need to make and how far can you go with discipline dae want to not work in soul sucking job and just chill out and do things you enjoy that what of humanity dreams of bro don quit without plan the least you can do is calculate how far your savings will last you should you quit after that make detailed plan on how to stretch your savings finally as someone else commented try picking up some freelance work on the internet or irl to set up network fallback if you can find freelance work it probably means you ll have to live solely on your savings oh and be absolutely sure that you can land job again after sabbatical most industries choose to hire young uns because they are cheap and abundant so pretty soon you might find yourself too old or too expensive or both you may not want to go back to job but if things don go right you might just need to so make sure that avenue remains open source currently on sabbatical this is how did it did it out of the blue in just wanted to do my own thing had no idea what to do job is not something you are supposed to enjoy that why you get paid for doing it if it was something you enjoyed you would be paying to do it you do your job from monday to friday make money then use that money to pursue your hobbies read write travel during weekends holidays and vacations there is lot of stuff between like hate so try to get job you don hate you don necessarily need to love it use the money to pursue your hobbies you should generate some passive income start an online business selling products on amazon if you can do an investment of k and buy products from suppliers like alibaba etc you might generate passive income you can do research on that topic options are unlimited you just have to find them travelling takes toll on one body also it isn as galmours or enjoyable as people make it seems man without plan won survive much would not recommend was in your place few years ago little older lesser lpa more in bank headed north and stayed with friend planned to head further north to volunteer friend convinced me that was not what wanted plus had an epiphany over more rounds of beers than usual dropped the plan got back in the grind realized it is not time to give up just yet if the anecdote avove doesn help get and read the book vagabonding by rolf potts while would ve loved life on the road that life without purpose would have bored the fuck out of me in months in not years god things would have been different worlds apart even but m happy and content now to be frank almost everyone hates their job and want to leave it and instead travel and enjoy their life but only few are able to do so due to various factors agree with the top comment first take two weeks leave and then plan how you want to do it for the money part how much have you saved till now do you have any loans better invest your savings in gilt funds and overnight funds to get better returns than fd and savings account respectively as most people have suggested take shorter break and figure out what you like to do quitting before figuring out may backfire and you might end up in worse place what if you don like traveling after few months what if you don like psychology few months after you start your education d suggest taking time off and volunteering shadowing or working part time in field you like and testing the waters before making the leap also it might just be that you need to switch jobs in your industry and choose something more laid back rather make drastic change remember the grass always seems greener on the other side just take smaller steps to figure out things good luck tinnitus can make you feel like you have mental health problems but there a cure for that when your tinnitus is gone you will be thinking more clearly as you have already mentioned your state is not the one to make decision this big would suggest you to just go on medical leave for some time travel get best medical care for your tinnitus once its cured and you have clarity only then think about resigning do it leave the job listen to your heart in my opinion maybe you should take break like go hiking or enjoy vacation and so on leave those works or making money stuff behind check out this article about how to make money on travel blog www blogerio com how to make money on travel blog maybe you will get some ideas on how to achieve your goals 
unpopular opinion indians need to learn to stand up to own parents before talking big things about standing up to government political party or society  www reddit com india comments ebamp unpopular opinion indians need to learn to stand whats the point of grand ideals and rhetoric when most of us cant even handle being independent of the toxic support structure at home and restrict our support of people outside house except in social media or text bigots atleast are self empowered in their expression of hateful ideologies and most start by wanting to fit in with their families if those who disagree dont grow some spine to oppose loved ones youre not really going to make dent in those you dont love youll just do what youve been taught to do by family members at best run away  we need to teach critical thinking and formulating proper arguments and then begin asking questions to teachers and parents who mostly don like their authority to be questioned things follow from there lol gave me chuckle my uber serious indian girlfriend broke up with me because she couldn stand up to her dad emotional brainwashing we were almost engaged indian family structure is oppressive inherently schools media family everything is geared at teaching concept of respect that makes it difficult for indians to counteract against families those who do are rubbished throughout the extended families as black sheep what needs to happen is change in our system of education as well as the current generation being better parents to their children enabling them an opportunity to be critical thinkers exactly though believe that this had it roots in our culture as well as the education system from childhood itself the idea of unquestioned adherence to our parents and teachers is instilled quite deeply and the same people lose the ability to question any kind of authority and grow up to become obedient peons of the society they have no idea that what is taught to them is not always the right thing and that there always different perspective to look at things as long as this doesn change no amount protests is going to make difference also indians need to learn to stand up to those bully teachers in school also indians need to learn to stand up to those bully managers in work places also indians need to learn to stand up to those bully relatives in their families also indians need to learn to stand up to those bully bigoted unkills spreading vitriol in whatsapp groups also indians need to learn to stand up to the truth and accept it and not be crying like whining tch also indians need to learn to call piece of shit piece of shit scumbag scumbag an arsonist an arsonist rapist rapist and so on could not agree with you more this is primarily one of the reasons why indians are so docile and meek when it comes to defending their own ideas it is primarily because since childhood they are covered under the shroud of culture and riwaz and adults are these infallible and unerring beings who you should always listen to and never ever question their authority even in polite and civil fashion not to mention that if you do veer off against the ideology of your parents sometimes the consequences can be dire as you can be abused physically mentally or be outright abandoned this is the reason why we hesitate so much to speak out against corrupt politicians abusive policemen or local netas it is because the idea of blind respect is forcefully drilled into our brains from very young age unlike western countries we don have child protection agencies who look out for the welfare of kids and parents can pretty much get away with anything they do to their children in the name of discipline wholeheartedly believe that if indian parents did proper job of raising kids we have better society overall which would question people in leadership would be more confident and assertive and would possess the ability to comprehend what is right and wrong on larger level unfortunately when you raise kids in the environment of fear jealousy and hate you have the contemporary india that we can all see dont give up guys have changed my parents outlook to somewhat extent hope you will also after trying indians do need to stand up to their parents whenever it is necessary especially for life changing situations such as further education marriage life and so on but the problem is indian kids are so fearful that they hide even their basic relations with boyfriends girlfriends for fear of being disowned indian kids depend on money from parents at times upto even years or even years parents use these tools to control kids in their later life heck in my family my own sister who a strong independent woman can convince her boyfriend to elope because that dude is complete mama boy which makes me want to tell my sister to leave him because he such coward the dude has master degree and yet has never even heard of the special marriages act that the society today literate yet illiterate educated yet fools brazen yet cowards my mother uses kundalis and religious teachings generously to keep us controlled usually backfiring tremendously at the expense of the entire family almost always there is an unhealthy dose of arguments why are there more than lakh engineering students unemployed in india today why is there lack of lawyers in india why is there lack of legit thinkers in india why is dissent being shunned all because elders are always right and anyone below the age of is child and children know nothing believe in being rebellious all the time this is to get answers to questions no one is ready to answer have good day friend of mine told me how he stood up to his bigoted af uncle when he started on his usual hate filled rant about how muslims are ruining this country my friend started recording the point was simple if he has the conviction and feel what he is saying is the truth then he shouldn be scared to air his views needless to say he couldn edit word ran away from my shit hole of home last year and moved to brand new city thousands of kilometers down south and ve never been back fuck indian parents and the toxic society that acts as an enabler to them also antinatalism we follow feudal structure in india along with strong patriarchy even hinduism is feudal in nature with its caste system everything needs to broken to be remade sigh if only it were possible in our lifetime yeah when you don rebel bit they never change and lot of people think they ll be disowned for the smallest of arguments remember they need you more than you need them after few years showed mine graphic videos of lynching and they finally disapproved what was happening agreed indian parents want the youth to emulate bhagat singh only not their own spawn saar mummy khaana nahi pakayegi toh mar jaungaa yesterday had heated argument with my dad conservative over the cab and its protests can believe an engineer like him can be so illogical and blind to balance like you re either supporting cab because of emotional irrational bias to bjp which is wtf has the party sucked your cock off or what why the blind faith bhagwan thodi hai or because of apathetic majoritarian mindset either make me embarassed and disgusted at my father called him stupid and emotional for supporting the bill ck this so called culture traditions be free be independent but first move out of your parent basement the phrase mai baap sarkaar exists for reason instead of the government serving the people the default assumption in india seems to be that the government is doing you favor by ruling and telling you what to do witness demonetization upcoming nrc etc bhai this is so true yesterday was out shopping with my mom and the shop had tv telecasting this the keeper and my mom started slurring about them aur karo protest and smirking felt so guilty did that today my father understood but jokingly called me communist did multiple times got beaten up too multiple times what shot what shot totally agree hahaha truer words have never been spoken most of my friends are still shocked by how chill my parents are and always when give advice of talking to parents for their opinion often get ridiculed about it folks are just afraid of their parents even after being plus haha cries in cowardice and dependence on them bhai kya bola hai tere muh me ghee shakkar agree with most of what you say but here is the thing its not your parents faults simple as that if we think we are better than them in terms of our forward and open minded thinking then we also need to realize that our parents were born and brought up in completely different era we have no idea what they have been through those times were rotten with fear and depression take for example my grandparents who lived during the fearful war days around and almost escaped burning train during the india pakistan division my mom and her family lived in fear and oppression her entire life she wanted to get herself educated from an english medium school but my grand parents could not afford her education these were the days truly dark times disagree as much as you want with your loved ones try to change their thinking but don force your opinions on anyone for that matter try to put yourself in their shoes and just try to understand the world that they have come from we are moving in forward direction the only direction in future is forward if you don believe that then you need to open your mind and see where we have come in the last years with the rise of internet and just being able to openly voice our opinions on public forums and social media we will change we will get better its going to take time probably another years or more but we will get there just relax and do your best without hating or offending your loved ones by realizing that they didn have the same privilege as we do today they didn get the opportunities to shine like we have today so instead of trying to fight them work with them and try to instill positivity in whatever you do in life this world is not perfect no human is perfect and nothing in this world will ever be perfect learn to appreciate what you have peace and love maybe it because was born in the states but leaned in college to just tell me parents what they wanted to hear and then do whatever wanted anyway it did not work right away and led to many fights but eventually they realized it was my life and needed to be in control of that still solicited them for advice and help but the final decision is always mine don think it really worked until decade later when proved could make good money without having to be doctor though since then ve advised indian friends to do the same but it had mixed results guess it depends on your situation agree that it is important to stand up to your family for the things that you believe in but don think any reason why we can do the both at the same time changing people attitudes is process and it takes time especially when you re dealing with your parents most of the time they dismiss you as being childish and suffering from the idealism of the youth and they can do that because they re your parents but do agree with you we have to start the process at our home and extend it to wider society man all these stories are making me so grateful for my parents m gonna go now and hug my mom deleted sorry guys but misinformed people are greater threat to this country than any bad politician tadipaar and or jumlebaaz wow that hit right in the sanskar reminds me of the russell peters sketch you have minutes to call the police tbh your problem is not problem just in india it in other countries if you don stand for anything you will fall for anything sometimes standing up to the government is way easier than standing up to parents it natural our parents have raised us and our future is intertwined with them very often we are financially dependent on them till we are adults the level of emotional blackmail possible is very high unless we are willing to be cut out of wills and ruin the relationships our children will have with our parents standing up to parents will always be more difficult than protesting on the street would argue the former often needs more courage summed up exactlymy feelings change starts from your home this is so true am glad to know many people are thinking about this hope is kinda lost for this generation parents hopefully it would be better from the millenials onwards respect elders and respect teachers mentality needs to go if ever have childrens will teach them respect only the one they deem it worthy of it gold worthy be financially independent then you can take your own decisions first young indians need to smash that bigoted uncle who keeps coming around your house spewing nonsense about poor people and other religious minorities m sure you guys know who m talking about yaar ve been standing up to my parents for years now pehle it was still better they did listen but modia has taken the better of them it so much worse now they speak the modia speak any evidence any counter and any argument is fake news to them it ends up in serious yelling matches no matter how we start it earlier there was doubt and suppressed belief that muslims are bad now it a loud and proud truth for them that they want to oppress minorities talking politics has become pain and constant frustration in the family my understanding is that indian boomers lack any empathy are submissive to the system fear backlash and have only succumbed to capitalist consumerist materialistic lifestyles good luck with that gave up trying to reason with my mother being the only atheist in family is difficult my mother trying to convince me and me trying to convince her it a dead end not gonna work stood up to my parents when was in my teenage years and they have given me space every since which has made me more confident was also very anti establishment when was younger but it has been clear for some time that both sides are shit including the jnu students bjp rss congress and even those protesters in assam this subreddit is great

you can be on any side of the political spectrum and no matter who you are you can deny our country is in chaos www reddit com india comments eaeqe you can be on any side of the political spectrum i have both right wing and left wing relatives and friends but no matter who they are they all agree our country is in utter chaos for right wing supporters like my dad the reason for this chaos is liberal islamists illegal muslims trying to take over india etc you know the usual right wing rants and for the left wing supporters the reason for this chaos are the whatsapp university passed bhakts who are pro fascism but whatever the reason is one thing remains that our country conditions aren good at all if you look from foreigners perspective india is now hellhole its economy is in shambles riots are breaking out all over india over the controversial acts of bjp like nrc cab university fee hikes etc rape reports are rising with the recent brutal telangana rape case kashmir has been in dark for months now internet shutdown has now become the norm of bjp and if your area is facing internet shutdown its just another day in india not to mention things like pollution water running out environmental and climate crisis etc its very hard to maintain peace and sanity in minds of people in this pathetic condition of this country no wonder twitter and other social media are such toxic place nowadays nobody is at peace at least in this country everybody is paranoid frustrated and angry at each other sometimes just wonder what our country initially aspired to become developed nation with money technology freedom and peace and look at what it has become  deleted the other worrisome part is that this ridiculous nationalism and polarization is growing around the world the political fights in us uk eastern europe hong kong are very similar shit that gets posted through facebook whatsapp is also similar we need to gear up have right winger acquaintance who is celebrating conservative party victory in uk today he thinks economy is fine and guess what he is getting phd from an iit remember abdul kalam vision poor fella must be turning in his grave now and you didn even mention the naxalites seriously this introduction could be referencing the united states and it would ring true they can and they do it very unfortunate and got into heated argument with bhakt uncle just yesterday it a sad situation what did you guys expect after voting for bjp you never vote for party whose tagline is ache din aayenge good chunk of liberal democracies across the world are going through what we are going through and there are various reasons to it it would be very simplistic to just blame one single thing for the predicament we see ourselves in and in the same vein it not that complicated either sticking to india situation right now it really is as bad as they say and even more but would disagree with your assumption that the right wing nuts agree that this country is in chaos and the reason being the media echo chamber all of us are stuck in social media is giving every idiot opinion an outlet where million other idiots validate it do you understand the kind of gratification and validation social media gives to lower middle class upper caste hindu mobile store owner from meerut when he posts bigoted shit on his fb timeline and gets his peers validation instantly it a high man am sure you are feeling that same dopamine rush right now when people like this very post we as nation did not have this even years back and now are struggling how to deal with it right wingers across the world and in india learnt to weaponize disinformation when they were out of power and perfected the art while liberals still operated in the confines of mainstream media where their ideas could flourish and be debated to put it crudely liberals tried playing chess with the right wingers while they shat on the chess table and kept flinging poo on their face and all the while liberals kept expecting them to come to the table and play like decent human beings they will not and they will never play the game they are the weakest in and there lies the problem how do you make political party an ideology and their ardent supporters be moral when being immoral benefits them if am being very honest and go to the gutters can make reasonable observation that the years of economic growth and prosperity that this country saw in spite of all the problems has been somewhat leveling the playing field for all the castes and communities and that where the problem arises ironically indian society not your urban centers but the countryside the tier and tier cities were the upper caste saw their power structures being threatened by the marginal or sometimes even the fictional economic prosperity of dalits and muslims felt threatened the very fact that money was changing the power dynamics between communities was more insulting to them than anything else and you only need to ask any person from the aforementioned places about their views on dalits and muslims the very economic prosperity that the nehruvian india was getting them was also destabilizing the social structure of the society no more could brahmin child could tell dalit to go fuck off and eat shit or hate on muslims without being shamed in the media not that it stopped them and they resented it just like how the white americans made the deal with the devil trump to assuage their ill founded grouse with the demographic change the same deal was made by the upper castes who have been inherently casteist and xenophobic for centuries with the sangh to put social order back in place we are where we are because of this pact you give me my social power back and give you the political power you want to play out your hindu rashtra fantasies the larger upper caste population is ignorant and downright stupid to understand the nuances between nrc or cab or why it is such an horrible act because they need to earn living and also coz stupid but know that the current disposition will give them the power they want that was taken away by nehruvian india so to anyone still reading this dariye mat jab tak whatsapp pe good morning bhejne ki suvidha hai tab tak ye desh khushali se aage badhtaa rahega log protests kare toh kare inko koi farak nahi padta shaitan uske saude pe kharaa utar raha hai toh bass aap iss hindustan mai kaise rehna chahte ho woh aap teh karre it is indeed some still think it an exaggeration though oh and you re damn right about twitter being hell hole the amount of toxicity in there is chilling liberal islamists they don exist either islamofascist or liberal it like the s again god help us all we solve this issue politicians in india we solve this issue by forging another issue m an anarchist and we re absolutely loving it s well this country has always been the shit hole the only difference is before the internet all the shit was happening in the small groups so people were living in the bubble of their own be it liberals or bhakt now internet has given the mega phone to everyone what wrong with the economy haven heard anyone complain about it look from foreigners perspective india is now hellhole its economy is in shambles riots are breaking out all over india over the controversial acts of bjp like nrc cab university fee hikes etc rape reports are rising with the recent brutal telangana rape case kashmir has been in dark for months now internet shutdown has now become the norm of bjp and if your area is facing internet shutdown its just another day in india not to mention things like pollution water running out environmental and climate crisis etc and some foreigner told you this get off the twitter or whatever stuff driving you nuts or else you will get mentally unstable considering the state of your mental health my grandmother is now years old and she has seen the partition wars the countless insurgency and economic crisis don know if you calling this economy in shambles you would really struggle to find another noun for it and here we are she said that firstly there was no tv or internet at that time so life was pretty simple and secondly we tend to get over it every time and protests riots deleted we aren citizens we are products and politicians using these products to earn profits
is losing friend merely because of their political indifference worth it  www reddit com india comments eezdk is losing a friend merely because of their i have friend an andh bhakt to be precise and we ve been sort of getting into lot of heated arguments lately m starting to think of avoiding all sort of contact with him but he also someone who ve known for the longest of times m super confused what the heck do do seeing his posts on defending the current behavior of the government is getting on my nerves  d say keep your friendship but instead of indulging in arguments about politics try to understand his perspective by asking questions learn the socratic method let him figure out the flaws in his reasoning instead of you trying to convince him of the opposite play devil advocate sometimes and learn to think like him you will figure out where he coming from and when you understand that you will be in much better position to ask him potent questions well got into argument with bhakt but long time friend at the end told him arguing with you will be pointless let it be bus bhai dosti bani rahe to which he replied everyone has choice mute everything on social media and don engage politically keep in contact only as friend the blind will remain blind imo there is no true friendship possible when there is an ideological moral difference between two people personally have stopped talking to so many people it liberating go ahead remember if they re indifferent towards kids being killed and students being blinded they re not good people and are highly selfish personally if friend is bigot block them and stop talking to them ll make other friends you might be the only opposite opinions he hears if you keep talking same to him there a chance is chance that eventually he might see the light of the day on political differences probably not but observe how his her political views affect them as person directly or indirectly there ll be change in past few months ve got rid of several toxic personalities disgusting human beings from my school group while couple of them still remain good friends no friendship extends beyond spheres of petty politics into the very brutal real world friends are some of the most important people you will ever meet treat them with care and don try to lose them especially not for something so small as differing political views almost of my friends and family is andha bhakta when you wear clothes in between naked people it going to be difficult the best thing for you to do is engage in conversation and just laugh at their ignorance it works for me everytime my friends thought would change and join the cult but guess my parents raised me better in every way possible where was taught that free thinking and having different opinion is absolutely fine don burn bridges for fucking politicians you never know that idiot bhakt might help you in times of crisis you can change someone perspective certainly not by fighting them it especially not worth it when you are surrounded by sanghi have bhakt friend who kept trying to convert me to his side told him point blank that there should no political discussions of any nature between us and he shouldn send me any political jokes explainers etc value him as friend and didn want to lose him so it was necessary my father always said aadmi kitna bhi chutiya ho contact rakhne chahiye pata nahi kon chutiya kis din kaam aajaye which live by how much of jerk person might be politically socially we should learn how those interest judgements do not get in the way and we smile back talk about different things going to go against the trend here but wouldn lose sleep over ditching friend and here is why what your friend has exhibited is most likely disregard for the suffering of others because he views them as others this is often the case with conservatives compassion and empathy are traits they generally lack now how does this relate to your situation well for now you guys are friends but the day something happens to you or you fall into the others category best believe this guy girl will not have your back lastly what wrong in not engaging with bigots every liberal is not responsible for saving the bigoted conservatives at most your job is to put pressure on governments to safeguard rights of all citizens politics and ideology are the two things that have the power to make sane educated man blind and irrational politics affect real lives of people around you so yes it worth losing dickhead who still support bjp after all this there no excuse for being an unbelievably retarded asshole despite education the kind of choices we have to make due to our divider in chief been there done that totally worth it socratic method that should work also see how he treats people in general bhakts are generally assholes but one of my best friends who is otherwise wonderful person is borderline bhakt and today we had severe argument over the caa nrc shit she blocked me on whatsapp at one point but didn let her go called her and then she told she has some problems irl so you never know my entire family cousins extended family and all my friends are bhakts can never enter into rational argument with them what is man supposed to do does your friend support laws throwing adults and children into detention camps your friend may be piece of shit mensutra made video about this check it out you don get to choose your family but you do get to choose your friends unfriend and mute their posts or stick with it don forget though that the friend of thief is also called thief how can be friends with someone who supports party which openly claims they want to murder me tell him let agree to disagree and not bring this up again at the end of the day you both have the right to have your opinions if you feel the friendship has some meaning to you don lose it over political differences it doesn help anyone next time it comes up just firmly say let not get into this all over again and stick to it don think it healthy for you to let your political identity or ideology to overshadow other aspects of your personality identity the vast majority of my friends disagree with me on some issue or the other and frankly love getting into debates with them because it helps me clarify my own views in some instances particularly on sensitive issues there is really not much to gain by engaging in debate so it better to move on for the sake of your friendship at the end of the day think your personal relationships matter more than differences in ideology if you are surrounded by people friends online communities who are negative about most of the things then it is good idea to stop going around them it is important for your own mental and overall growth all this negativity on different things being spread needs energy energy which could have been spent on the welfare of our nation it is channelized failure of the energy of millions of citizens of our country via whatsapp think about your personal life goals the good time it is the new year and it is okay to trim down friends family networks who just spread hate and hate the most important skill is to learn how to think critically and not to be donkey yes it is andhbhakti ka koi ilaj nahi no in my opinion its not worth losing friends on ideological beliefs recently read piece in print by some asim ali regarding this cancel culture you cant cancel modi rss why us style identity politics wont help indian liberals figh theprint in opinion you cant cancel modi rss why us style identity politics wont help indian liberals fight went off social media because my friends supported the babri verdict know am fool but sometimes you just have to draw the line if meet right wing conservative in real life can be cordial but do not think we could be friends no relationship is above mental peace my closest friend was bhakt we were mature enough to never be personal with our arguments but would many times find holes in his arguments then recently should him video of how everything modi said was lie and plus there is no internet in his hometown which he thinks is unfair now he is putting anti caa stories on insta and they are much more impactful since he was known bhakt you don need to convince him but instead try and understand where he is coming from they say don lose your friends over politics would say don lose your humanity over friends the onus is on both of you to understand each other view points and come to real understanding as to why your ideas differ behind everyone ideas there is lived experience and you as friend have to understand that rather than branding him bhakt there may be many things you dont know about him his life which you might get to know through this just like your ideas cant be absolutely correct his ideas can be completely misplaced bridge the gap in understanding before making any decision about your friendship even if he is just consuming wrong information from biased news sources then there would be reason behind that as well maybe he has always been referring to those news sources since his early childhood days because his parents also trusted those sources and he had always respected his parents decisions and their ability to think for one he and for that matter no bhakt is going to have his come to jesus moment if you dont show any sympathy for his opinions it is simply not human nature to be derided for your opinions and be shown lack of respect for having them and you having complete change of ideology as result your political stance is stance for respect and acceptance and it starts with your friend

caste conundrum why do upper castes believe discrimination doesn exist  www youtube com watch vjtaboejhonan m sorry but this is hilarious but at the same time it sad af especially that thakur guy and that brahmin pandit no amount of education is gonna change people like them and it just sad to say that majority of the population in india is like them brahman mandir me ganta bhajate hai aur hum logoko bewakoof banate hai it sad to see literates condoning casteism how fucked up is our education system asking upper castes if discrimination exists is like asking white people if racism exists shocking as this may seem most white people will say that racism used to exist years ago maybe but not anymore here a simple idea of humans are right handed are left handed if you look at all the students who have gotten into college and found that the split between right and left handers isn that an indication that something strange is going on if you see or that not necessarily an indication that left handers are being discriminated against actively or that right handers are genetically superior but certainly something to investigate further if you saw the split in saw mill you might come to the conclusion that right handers are simply better more hardworking more deserving after all the interview process didn ask them which their dominant hand was and poor performers are fired if you investigate you ll realise that all your tools are designed for right handers ask any left hander you know about scissors and this inherent disadvantage means that they can work effectively but if you never investigate you ll never find out and even after if you don have the will to fix it nothing will improve we need two things to solve problem figuring out the solution then implementing the solution if solving the problem would harm us why would we bother why would bunch of right handers fix the tools at the saw mill when it would increase competition for jobs and that is what reservation does upper castes approx of the population would take of the seats in higher education if there was no reservation you might see that and think fair enough if that how the exam results look that the way it should be but we could potentially fix this by investing lot more in public education in rural education if we paid teachers x more spent x on teacher training x more on school facilities we would bridge the gap in or years but we won because the people with power and influence in society all send their kids to private schools anyway we are not personally affected by the problem of lack of opportunities so we have no incentive to fix it just like the right handers won fix the tools if we actually fixed it and india became egalitarian our of society would only get around of the seats that a worse situation than we are in currently where we have why would we spend thousands of crores to actually reduce the opportunities available for our kids we won that why reservation exists to give an opportunity for the folks who went to shitty schools with shitty teachers shot at better life and now you might reasonably ask but look what difference does it make all the benefits go to tiny minority of people from that caste and you are right but you re forgetting two things firstly in india people take care of their extended family the first person from clan to go to college and get good job mentors their siblings and cousins pays for their education brings them up and secondly although most people from lower castes won actually benefit from reservation it still source of hope for them they are poor they have no prospects not only that poor public education means their kids don have prospects either but they don know it they delude themselves into thinking their kids could potentially go to college under reservation but this is horrible these poor people are being duped you might think but it works out well for the rest of us because the day the downtrodden majority wakes up and realises that they and their kids have no hope they will burn society to the ground the same will happen if reservation is stopped because that is their only hope of better life no more reservation sounds good but all the colleges have been burned down you ll have of the seats which are now enjoy imho grew up in city hyderabad all my life and have personally not seen untouchability to the extent where it needs so much reservation but then started engineering in and there was guy hari who was is st not bright lad didn speak english low on self confidence and would sit by himself one day we were playing carroms and we only had guys so invited him to play and he refused and literally had to drag him to play and saw him smile the first time we played end of story from then on he would just smile at me and year went by in second year spoke to him just casually why he doesnt talk to anyone but these days he started coming to play carroms and tt and he didnt answer and then pestered him over weeks and he said did not know everyones caste and did not want to pick any fights said what why do you want to know caste and he said am st and people dont like us touching and he sat next to couple guys on bench and got to know all were sc st and over next days he told me stories about how he was made felt in his village guess people in cities live in bubble or are not exposed to lot of atrocities or oppression people in villages face it was still crazy realization had until then but is reservation the answer dont know if show this video to one of my upper caste friends his caste was once on the verge of being declared as an obc but after the people of his caste expressed outrage due to provocation by upper castes it never got declared as obc he will say that the video is scripted and will say that all of this is made up shit and that untouchability and caste discrimination are very rare today removed most people do not base their worldview on statistic tables but on their personal experiences or taught worldview untouchability heavy caste based segregation and oppression based on caste based delineation especially towards dalits exists we have decades over decades of statistical evidence to prove that but to people who haven grown up in that kind of environment it is hard to rationalize this with what their acquired worldview is and the first reaction is to vehemently deny it altogether this isn just caste but climate change racism debates about specific economic policies kashmir and so on however these kind of anecdotal interviews are about as valid as privileged tier urbanite going ve never seen casteism these are fringe cases etc showing it as perspective is fine trying to use it as concrete evidence of systemic caste based oppression around the country is less tenable am an sc and benefctor of our great eservation system reservation has only helped me in getting into admission into tier college my basics was very weak as came from vernacular medium government operated school even though got admission was still outcaste as didn have that rich vibes which other general category student has only solace was that was good in sports which made me popular in campus let me get it straight my view is reservation should be there but there has to be cap and additional regulation reservation should only be there in primary and secondary level of education in premier private schools not the government colleges now as per present condition my son can avail reservation but don think it is required as my wife is brahmin and am living in tier city where atleast my son hasn faced any such caste discrimination my building watchmen is brahmin who salutes me daily to get some tip if there is procedure where can forego my son sc status to his son then will happily do it if caste has to be the unspoken thing first and foremost thing to do is to stop talking about caste self is where the start comes from we can change elders but we can change this generation and ourselves give this guy good mic for god sake genuinely asking what is wrong with reservation system based on economics instead of caste since most lower caste individuals are anyway disadvantaged economically they will be accommodated at the same time rich people who happen to be of lower caste will not be eligible thus allowing some other more deserving lower caste economically disadvantaged person to take their place didn watch the video but the answer is simple upper caste have not faced caste discrimination against them like how the dalits do and hence they feel it doesn exist often the guys in question actually treat all people well and hence feel this is myth even if large majority of upper castes don perpetuate caste discrimination there is sizeable population who do it and also tacit approval from equally large number of people also in my experience in the south atleast upper castes may sometimes be arrogant but quite open minded most of the caste discrimination is done by obcs end caste system end reservation its that fuckin simple removed even though don doubt caste discrimination is there but you ll also have to look at the other side of the picture in urban areas castes are becoming irrelevant one of my school friends just months ago told me that he got seat in punjab university because he was an sc his father and mother are on also on government job money has never been an issue for him here is my take he didn need reservation for university because he is from well of family have been friends with him for years now didn even knew that he was an sc suspect he didn tell because he was afraid of how we ll see him if he came out therefore my view even though there are economic components to this problem but to solve it it will take social movement where people can be proud of there ancestors even though they came from lower castes removed don think they will like reservations based on economic conditions either muslims are one of the most economically disadvantaged communities in india removed

either india property developers are insane or am  www reddit com india comments djscs either indias property developers are insane or i i at the age where buying house is the next thing on my agenda ve been looking at listings on property websites lot lately so consequently most of the ads see online on instagram facebook and even reddit are for properties nothing about these properties or their pricing makes any sense to me whatsoever take new development by godrej in delhi godrej south estates they ve been spamming the shit out of me with their ads the prices start at only cr for bedroom for bedroom apartment rates start at cr they re pushing it as some sort of ultra luxury destination except its in okhla which is an industrial area used to have my office in the area and its literally one of the shittiest areas in the entire city there is literal trash mountain right next to the development not that development has even started yet they re advertising m apartments built near trash heaps witg delivery scheduled around modi next term the situation in gurgaon seems to be even more insane there are apartment complexes built in the middle of nowhere with not single street light for miles being advertised for crores meanwhile if you wanted an apartment in the already established well settled areas in dlf phase you can get them for half the price back in my hometown of jaipur apartments rates are equally out of whack you can pay cr for an apartment in vaishali nagar or you can buy piece of land meters away from the apartment and built little mansion of your own for less than cr my brain is not really able to compute any of this cr apartments that are not even ready built in the middle of nowhere who is buying them more importantly why are they buying them at this point feel that will keep renting all my life not because can afford house but because nothing about the indian property market seems rational to me make very substantial money but refuse to participate in this utter irrationality can wait to hear how millennials killed the realty sector try faridabad noida or ghaziabad delhi due it development commands hell lot of price in the property market gurgaon was once for those who couldn afford home in south delhi thanks to corporate invasion gurgaon too has become expensive even after having terrible infra meanwhile in noida extension you ll find guys jumping in the middle of the road trying to sell bhk for lacs that too is negotiable at the end of the day all boils down to demand supply and development truth is nobody is buying larger builders are forced to launch to cover costs of old projects continuously be able to make debt payments while raising more debt monetize existing land inventory and most importantly to keep up appearances my suggestion is to look for builders who have less than projects and are heavily focused on per project profitability and not company wide profitability or best buy plot and build dm if you have questions it doesn make any sense you are being charged premium for an apartment which is not yet built and will also depreciate with time not to forget it at location which maybe developed in the next few years there is definitely real estate bubble we just don know how it will pop ve worked in this sector and have followed the demand and supply trend and would urge you to reconsider your decision to buy an apartment reason land surplus area such as ncr will always have new apartments coming up and your old apartments will never see decent roi reason delhi has over years worth of supply to clear out before demand picks up again no one is buying these expensive concrete slabs in sky why should you if you just want to park your money for long term then buy semi liquid govt bonds if you re worried about inflation eating away your investments then buy gold if you re still hell bent on investing in real estate then buy land apparently we ve stopped making land who is buying them more importantly why are they buying them nris of randia are buying them for investment read somewhere that people are buying second hand homes directly from owners instead of from builders because of this its all speculation they are building flat with the target in mind that lpa guy invest all of his live in their flat but ignore the other fact of life its utterly foolish to invest in flat which will degrade over time at that high cost you are right soon they will cry millennial but no one ask them about unreasonable price its is same like doing challan of k fork bike go to hell always have wondered how realty companies are always keeping the price high even when economy is not really well or supply is very high there is no real supply demand pricing in the industry at all wouldn doubt for minute that there is collusion between the developers and they keep the price high also the money is paid upfront for many developments and they are not the ones losing money if it delayed due to not all apartments getting sold real estate is the black hole in which all the wealth clean and ill gotten alike flow nothing ever makes sense in real estate new money is created after existing assets and this leads to asset price inflation the only way to control this is to have property price linked progressive rates fees pegged at to fund local governments for second property increase it to double unless rented out on long term lets this would make it unattractive to invest unless you want to live there this would remove housing from the list of investment speculative instruments and finance local authorities to find basic things like trash collection and footpaths property rates will fall as well and hurt lot of people you must also understand the dynamics of constructing building firstly the primary determinant of price is the value of the land then you need govt permits and passing you need to get sewage lines and roads for all of this you must grease the wheels also often times the landowners charge extremely high prices for the land itself as it a psychological factor among indians regarding real estate it causes the prices to sky rocket while old farmland owners now ride around in mercs and bmws in order to distribute cost builders are left with one of two choices either build more apartments and smaller sizes but govt doesn give permission over certain height or they can build big apartments and price it at luxury not saying builders are victims here there is sufficient addition of their margins as well come from builder family and have been involved in this all my life these are my cents on the topic recently also saw video that will share below it not on this topic but it will help get little more clarity on the subject youtu be sgeqhssaqc they re advertising m apartments built near trash heaps witg delivery scheduled around modi next term wait what do you mean next term building construction money distribution local netas need it local sp need it local municipal corporation needs it plus add mafia too sand cement etc builders are not going to give them money out of their own pocket hence this high price boss if you think this is insane try mumbai am totally at loss to understand how normal folk can afford to buy an apartment in mumbai gave up waiting for the bubble to burst good five years ago keep hearing rumours about the supposed real estate crash but it hasn happened and don think it will this is all well and good but why haven you installed an ad blocker my friend so consequently most of the ads see online on instagram facebook and even reddit are for properties think it same in all other states am from ajmer rajasthan project is not yet started and prices of these flats starts from crores and this just only come to hyderabad millennials killed the sector by not having crores to buy these places nor being stupid enough to take out cr loan which they ll pay off for the rest of their life stupid stupid millennials why don you buy parcel of land and build your own mansion it better than living under the whims and fancies of pesky associations who will dictate their oft irrational terms plus you can hire an architect to design the building exactly to your specifications most will even be willing to work within your budgetary constraints only mention this because you said you can afford house imo if you are looking for something permanent t t cities are the choice way healer living cost however know people live somewhere while they work idk how though you pay rent for decades you lose lot of money loan emi system is no good again cause you the prices are too high my dad bought land couple of years ago that was double registered and had to take loss another one was encroached but that was like years ago if was buying it as an investment or remotely an apartment is way lower risk of course location is the most important criteria and those apartments sound like an terrible idea on that basis probably don go for brand builders m considering one here in bangalore that is being sold at sqft it at great location and the flat has been coming along well only thing is it not brand everyone knows did the math and the rent yield on this flat is similar to what my relatives have in australia iirc around odd years to pay off your buy price at the current rental value indian property developers are idiots tbh can conclude that after working with them for sometime don buy house now at least for next years there won be any reasonable price increase primary reason being there already too much unsold inventory buy only distress sale properties to answer your godrej example the reason they re charging premium cause they have the quality and finance to complete the project which hardly any developer has lot of investors buy at extremely low prices before launch and later sell at market prices whoever is ready to buy or they just hold them to park their money prices won come down no matter how much people want they just won increase in the years to come keep renting that a better way took me some time but ve convinced my parents it makes no sense to buy home vs renting you can also read the interview of abhishek lodha ceo of lodha group on economic times wait for next year to see problems with lodha like with jaypee refinancing risk mounts at lodha dev india ratings downgraded lodha debt to bbb citing large fy fe debt maturities poor operational performance and weak refinancing environment of the total gross debt of rsbn is domestic of domestic debt is with nbfcs total debt maturing in fye and fye is rsbn and rsbn respectively refinancing seems inevitable as internal accruals are unlikely to be sufficient given the current slow pace of residential sales which plummeted in fy the major assets backing the refinancing of debt are the unencumbered palava landbank of acres valued at rsbn and unsold inventory of rsbn bulk of the sales going forward is likely to accrue from six key mmr projects so the company may have to reduce prices to address falling sales as mumbai biggest developer any price action by lodha is also likely to impact market pricing honestly many uninformed nri keep buying these as investments but adjusted for inflation and apartment does not appreciate at all it better to rent these apartments and buy small plot of land with your money just make sure all documents are in order and don buy in boom they lobby together for the prices once the rate has been set you can do nothing no law is useful if the builder says am pricing amount then you have to pay the amount they can bring rera and all other things but nothing is going to change reason is the economic divide and population houses available also there is lot of political backing once builder for reconstruction told me that people who will those cr for the house want to leave with standard people those who have been leaving in the building are not of the standard and hence must leave so basically he was reconstructing on their plot building and making profit on their land but wanted them to leave because they were not standard people the society is also equally responsible for this shit this is horryfying to say the least soon people might have to living like hostel life for the rest of their life agree gurugram is very expensive same situation here my dad is retiring soon and we are looking for new villa in ahmedabad most of the independent houses starts from cr it not like we cannot afford it they are totally not worth the price asking cr for square feet house which is outskirts of the city is insane similar shit in pune everywhere you see hoarding for flats but feel these are way overpriced small bhk cost lakh in punawala dlf phase is not good place to move to it overbuilt and among the worst maintained areas of gurgaon among other things ve spent years here and looking forward to moving out next year exactly the same shit in pune was lucky enough to get small bit of land early on and built my own little mansion my friends find themselves in this situation now and they are explaining me the same shit it is ridiculous that property developer who has just bought land and finished planning the structure has somehow managed to assess property value at the time of sale years later or more rate of ameneties and this one was an absolute shocker for me cost for parking space in lakhs wtf at this point feel that will keep renting all my life if you like particular place you re renting it ll be far easier to negotiate long rental term with the owner than negotiating price with these real estate people while doing so you can create fund reserve and buy decent chunk of land to build proper house m at the age where buying house is the next thing on my agenda perhaps if you can defer this for later date you can invest in other stuff right now and later use this invested money to invest in real estate not because can afford house but because nothing about the indian property market seems rational to me indian real estate market was way ponzi scheme till rera came in prices won go down because it makes all parties unhappy its mexican standoff they are all holding guns to each others head everybody loses if prices go down best case prices go sideways for years and effectively get cheaper after adjusting for inflation builders would sell all their flats at pre launch for discount get paid upfront and use that to launch new project and repeat the exercise banks were happy to lend ever increasing amounts to such customers since home loans have low default rates and it builds their loan book buyer would make down payment builder is taking care of emi till possession anyways even if they sell it for appreciation in years its profit since they only paid to begin with obviously big assumption is that you will find buyer in years for your property as long as that keeps happening everyone is happy problem was specially bad in ncr market if you make list of flat owners of most of the stuck ncr projects you ll find quite an overlap same usual suspects owning flats in multiple projects now struggling to pay their emis when it comes to purchasing property have boomer mindset will never buy house in city rent it all the way at worst rather will buy farmland in my hometown with that sort of money cr apartments that are not even ready built in the middle of nowhere who is buying them it is estimated that most of the black money is is real estate there is your answer have already invested in flat in bangalore just years back thinking that this is what should invest in my lifetime for sure hastily bought one in slightly center part of the city which was in my budget but by sub par builder have regretted it few months after moving in for various of reasons strongly believe there are other great movable investing options than real estate which has faster and easier liquidating process would have not bought the flat had had this knowledge they keep putting out non affordable products that nobody wants and complain when nobody buys kinda like automobile honda city has more than doubled in price over years while remaining pretty much the same car how to make very substantial money please suggest ಠ ಠ serious reply only 
qnet dnt tell didn tell you www reddit com india comments dhnis qnetdnt tell i didnt tell you some of us might have heard of qnet and for those who haven this thread is for you guys this actually happened like year ago and had totally forgotten about it till someone pitched me qnet again few days ago back in had quit my cushy job and just about started my own startup so money was tight was highly motivated and looking to jump at any opportunity and this is when guy used to work with messaged me and told me he had this insane opportunity for me he said it was limited time opportunity and he was recommending me to his mentors this is where started feeling like this is an mlm pitch or some sort of scam but given that had always known him to be an honest fellow gave him the benefit of the doubt he scheduled meet with some senior and this was in sheraton delhi so first meet this lady who says she been working with this ecommerce networking company for past years and here is the gist of the talk had with her she earns lakhs by working only few weeks of the month travels the world when she fancies blah blah stuff like that heard more irrelevant business jargons in mins from her than did in my years of school tried to discuss on few of the business jargons she had been throwing around and realised she only knows the terms and not what they mean so in mins hear everything from her own success story to random stuff but not single word of what the opportunity is about or what the revenue model is only that the more hours put in the more money make and the returns are like she says she liked my personality motivation and whatnot and would let me know if qualified for the program then she goes on for minutes to say how ceos vps etc are lining up for this opportunity and even shows me her contact list saying all these people have been after her life so that she lets me in on this once in lifetime opportunity by now had figured out this was some good scam and cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro shes like she will recommend me but chances are guess what minutes later very senior person in the business happens to be coming to this very hotel and that she can arrange for me to meet with him now only and all had to do was impress him part meeting the so called bigshot so had earlier talked about my love for travelling and building my own business in marketing so the guy tells me that he has travelled over countries last year and the lakhs of rupees he makes from this business helped him to secure his own passion project apparently he was earning lakhs per month in the it industry before quitting his job but despite me repeatedly asking he did not tell me which company he used to work for or even what role he was working in by now am just enjoying my snacks and trying to see how far these scammers will go to sell me whatever it is they are trying to sell the guy also realised his sales pitch was not working and so he tried to convince me that was morally responsible for my parents having to work in their old age when should be able to provide for them and this opportunity was the only way was going to do that repeatedly asked him what organization would be working for and he evaded the question every single time the only thing he said was that microsoft handles their paperwork and hence they are trustworthy company at the very end he casually mentions that fees for xyz stuff are inr and that would be making that back in the next few weeks only thanked him finished my snacks and said would think about it very nearly wanted to go full ballistic and let him know what load of bs he had been going on about also they did ask for my pan card photo which said didn have on me and said will send it once get back which never did as for the guy who got me into this entire waste of time see him post motivational posts on social media daily post pics of trips to exotic places and him riding inexpensive cars he did try to pressure me into paying up the money and all he said was that the company name was qnet and nothing about what they did quick google search was enough to verify my doubts hope this story helps someone out there such shit keeps coming back with different names there was ebiz they were booked for fraud now it qnet we need to keep people aware of this thanks for sharing had an old colleague who was trying to convince me to join some mlm group he actually showed me pics from malaysia and some other country so these guys sponsor foreign trips antimlm would love this cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro lel beware the same guys are now roaming on the linkedin and sending unsolicited connect request with followup message on the upcoming excellent business proposition deleted first meet this lady was the lady good looking experienced pretty much the same story but downgraded version in the meeting happened in ccd outlet in bandra wasn even offered coffee got caught into this by my ex boss the best reason that the female recruiter gave me was that she woke up at am that day because she wanted to see the sun rise was the schmuck according to her who got up early because he had to reach office on time if only would join her ponzi scheme even could enjoy such financial independence she implied told her that needed to be in office early the next day and left quickly cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro but you got free snacks my best friend joined some mlm back in it was just payment and same old members story told him take my and make me member if you really need to make member because you are my best friend but will not make any new members being best friend he denied my offer soon he realized its not worth just plainly say don have money or time friend of mine approached me with the same scheme too had to go through what you had too just said their company is ocean which indeed is part of qnet about years ago in bangalore randommer approached my flatmate and while we were shopping for groceries noped out of there and my flatmate was already aware of the scam went there to have an amazing buffet lunch enjoyed it qnet is old scam qnet ebiz are some local mlm scams herbalife is international which is also found in india met qnet guy whole ago at ccd asked him to pay for the coffee and the pizza and acted interested while eating it and after finishing it asked him to get lost what do they do with the pan card do they misuse it qnet believe is the same company which was running goldquest questnet etc back in s these companies made me wary and skeptical of any of the old school or college mates or old colleagues who suddenly contact me out of the blue thankfully many just wanted to connect again dude pretty much experienced the same stuff from qnet except for the claims that were made to you about income so atleast they were bit honest than the ones you met also after couple of hours was eventually told what was the business whole hours of sitting there and listening to the bs they kept on saying the whole ccd was populated by this guys gals only btw am talking about bengaluru one of my camaraderie did infact purchase the product of around lacs dude still posts photos of his travels to mostly thailand inspirational quotes but believe me that guy has multiple credit cards and maxed out most of them has taken several loans he might be successful in the long run but totally not worth for the effort that he puts in friend got into amway and tried hard to get me in even joined the program but only used for personal purchases so my account did not last for long made few thousand rupees but of course spent more on buying products for personal use products were good but not worth the premium prices but it was ok good fun experiment eventually the friend became so pushy that had to end up cutting him out of my personal life not sure how well he is doing with his amway venture he had well paying job and hope he is still continuing there on related note on becoming god in central florida is good show worth watching on mlm programs it not documentary probably satire good watch also have seen notices at chaayos ccds and other outlets mentioning how mlm sales pitches are not allowed on their premises things must be crazy for them guess qnet is everywhere my old college friend now he not used to call me years after college just to say how are you and casually mention how amazing his business is doing guess what his business is making other people give money to qnet fuck those people regret not outing this guy on the college whatsapp group what snacks did you get

how do change myself  www reddit com india comments dkih how do i change myself i come here for solutions to problem that believe is unique to me m coaster lazy is the adjective that describes me well since childhood ve been master at procrastination this tendency of mine has caused great harm ve lost lot that valued dearly m about to graduate ve had an epiphany that no employer would tolerate my tantrums ll have to reform at school d do just enough to pass my study habits at college weren different steadily this aversion from working percolated in my daily life obviously the consequences were disastrous now want to get better due to my disinclination to work hard m not equipped with the skill sets companies desire my slothfulness has had an impact on my employability help me shed laziness and evaluate my strengths so as to become employable m unskilful struggle sometimes even at handling computers and then meditate on my actions and think that may be less advanced mentally  it not unique lol just be very social no need to change any other priorities work discipline nothing just be very social and honest and it will fall in place just change username to confidentsonofabitch it seems to me that you re suffering from an underlying condition most probably adhd given what you ve written my advice is that go see therapist psychologist once you make progress go see life coach career coach who will push you in your daily life and add direction very important to treat the root cause stay alone in place far away from home rent and hunger are two powerful motivators read atomic habits asap this is not unique and am procastinator too infact very good one but have learnt to priortize my shit have found from my personal experience that procastinated about things that wanted yet the thought of failing or not having desirable result somewhere in my mind made me not do it even though enjoy doing what do the best way to do this imho is too fill your schedule completely am in cyber sec but now have also started investing my time in osint military specfiic homelabbing as hobby am not aware of lot of things in osint but am slowly picking it up why did picked up them as hobby you ask homelabbing helps me progress in my career and osint is helping me understand geo politics of the world through very intricate and an intresting lens providing the ability to understand why are countries doing what they are also because its cheap and can go hand in hand with my profession so find line of work and hobby that you can keep up with little bit of procastination is fine the question of change is quite complex don fool yourself with over the counter solutions people give you you re lazy and you want to be active so you want to be the opposite of what you are now but what you want to be is just an idea not fact what you are now is fact and therefore you can deal with it so the first thing to realise is that you don create an opposite of what you are now and then chase it that way you ll just wear yourself out once that is understood you re left only with what is fact which is that you re lazy now you can deal with it start by asking why are you lazy being lazy is perhaps an indication of not really being interested in anything or anybody now why are you not interested in anything is it because you subconsciously see the mediocrity of our living then you can ask why is our life mediocre it probably because we conform to everything that is being told to us second hand living in which there is nothing new or no avenues for you to be or express yourself once you see the importance of not conforming to pattern then you ll perhaps start discovering what your true interest is have you ever asked that question what is it that you re really really interested in it could be something as simple as taking solitary walk anything you discover it for yourself that discovery itself will then turn into passion for living jordan peterson on youtube if that all you can think about rn then you should probably get into some personality development program ve seen many people participate in them for this sole reason get into any sales support role there will be high work pressure but from your description about yourself it will be an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object so you will find equilibrium sounds like you have depression since years m in my early s and been in the same boat its only since the last couple of months that ve started taking action when observed that my professional and social life has become stagnant start taking ownership it all begins from there once you realise that you are responsible for your current state in life learn to prioritise and stick to schedule no matter what practice mindfulness and staying in the present even though your thoughts might lead you elsewhere exercise daily in the morning this helps you be active throughout the daily any form of physical exercise will do it will be hard to practice for the first few days start focussing on finding your strengths or things that you can be good at and start working towards it ve got two words for you david goggins www youtube com watch ecln avuk focus on your health and diet get relevant blood reports for vitamins minerals and levels and opinion of qualified doctors start small on whatever you want to work on like just study for hours daily for week then increase it to hours next week focus on your addictions there shouldn be any but if you are addicted to something reduce consumption of that particular thing first thing would suggest is fix your sleep schedule sleep early and wake up early have procrastinated through lot of my adult life but since have started waking at have some special energy that helps me complete any task feel fresh most of the time secondly add physical activity to your life it way more significant than people think also you have to fight yourself slowly make whatever you do as habit make schedule and force yourself to do it on time work or study what you like interested in the subject helps alleviate procrastination have aim in life and get your act together it easier

is upsc worth it  www reddit com india comments cdduar is upsc worth it okay so think see lot of potential when it comes to india progressing as nation and all do not have plans of immigrating to another country wanna make india better place to live in have been thinking of taking upsc exams in order to influence policy making decisions etc are they worth it despite the reservation system and all also how do we alter abolish the existing reservation system it a huge drawback that india has  if you want to remove or alter the current reservation system you have to replace it with better system which works for the welfare of lower castes people you are little misguided here dear friend like was some time back reservation is not the problem discrimination is if you want to make india better place and you have the capability of clearing the exams go for it reservation becomes problem only when you can get seat at your desired college or wherever that exam takes you to right ask rural dalit how they feel when they re classified as untouchable and the treatment that follows can chill with regular folks can sit on table where touchables sit clean your shit but let talk about merit why not try clearing the exam and land up in the unreserved portion but you rather be the th based on your merit rather than the th of the touchable portion same for sc gets shot at out of seats st out of simple just end discrimination and that ll solve the problems of reservation but but but my manusmriti and my varna system oops can let that go 
do you feel that point of view of general public is slightly changed about our pm after yesterday events  www reddit com india comments du do you feel that point of view of general public i mean come on you ve got to give him some credit he landed in bengaluru from two day visit of russia at afternoon of th september in day he did meet few people went to isro center at am midnight of th september stayed there late until am though mission did not go as planned though with heavy heart he left the place after giving small speech of encouragement to scientists immediately in morning at am he gave speech at isro bengaluru facility acknowledging scientists the nation about lander mission failure after that we saw moving interaction between crying isro chief and pm comforting him this interaction really gave me chills and will be forever etched on my memory pm of nation comforting crying isro chief on his shoulders well if you think he stopped there then you are mistaken he immediately embarked plane to attain the inauguration ceremony of launch of new mumbai metro lines he gave speech there but before that he didn forget to attain th anniversary of local ganapati mandal at noon he left mumbai for aurangabad to facilitate th crore beneficiary under ujjwala scheme and to open first greenfield smart city there another speech and lastly at the end of the day he was planned to visit nagpur but due to heavy rains forecast he unfortunately had to cancel now you tell me at his age who works this harder for nation do we really deserve him and will people now be little kinder to him  guys guys we have found him you are right we dont deserve him he must step down lmao this is some theunkillnetwork shit imagine thinking that just doing speeches and attending inaugurations is working hard for the nation guess who else also does these multiple trips for such pr events bollywood stars varun dhawan must be one of our greatest freedom fighters jai hind and will people now be little kinder to him boy really hope not he also cut the salary ahead of launch so it cancels out everything going by your previous posts you are trolling us arent you lol dude the guy is easily the most popular politician in recent memory he probably never lost an election in his life personally don like him cause think he uneducated but it ll be foolish to deny his popularity the pm who sold my country to the phoreners by amending the electoral donations system gets no respect from me even if he travels all across the globe x for photo ops no one has ever said that our pm is lazy it is true that he is good orator and works extra hard only if he had used his energy and skills for good purposes see the entire thing as drama he knows indians are emotional soppy things and he was playing to the gallery for him india seems to be like bollywood movie audience take the audience through emotionals ups and downs and leave them begging for more that more than enough to win the next election seems to be working with you we need smart educated rational person at the helm he may have busy schedule and he may be sticking to that schedule for the sake of his hard work but whether that hard work is of any use to the nation is the question you need to ask yourself credit for what for doing his job as pm these are all gimmicks to influence people just like you were think isro did fantastic job and have really exceeded expectations from time to time it nice to see the pm acknowledge their efforts but why would that change my mind towards him just because he hopped from place to place to give speeches my respect for the isro scientists has undoubtedly increased manifold lol who works harder for this nation going around and giving speeches to raise morale etc is good thing but aur bhi kuch kro in gimmicks ke ilawa downvote me all you want but all modi doing is showbiz propaganda and from the looks of your post especially the last line it did work on you and am sure so many others are you for real dude are you this naive granted every major media house is under bjp pocket but if you are just regular on india you might know how our economy is tanking and how unemployment is at all time high this is the guy who follows abusers on twitter for crying out loud our pm is just showman if you were impressed by his schedule yesterday you might wanna look how rampant schedule he had for conducting rallies all over india he is incompetent and overall failure he knows it and owns it that why his party has media in kaka lap and bribe any journalist they can so that they won highlight his failure kaka is also generous though since media can show his failures he gives them material by making appearances speeches wherever he can so that his godi media can vomit all of that out on our telivisions let see him work this hard for reviving economy create employment opportunities and since he is so disheartened for isro scientists maybe he could increase their budget allocation so we don have to brag about our cheapest space missions he is pm of our country he can do so much more than just lending his shoulder for sivan to cry on infront of cameras is this modi reddit account that the bare minimum mazaak chal raha hai kya from what know believe pms job is much more than just photo ops travelling around could do some real work maybe also many global leaders are the same age do much more that video of him consoling sivan might have earned him some pr points in national and international media thread on space was all in praise for him but that doesn change how his government has brought the indian economy in downhill it doesn change how his government is polarizing india for their political benefits zor se kaho kehte raho modiji is one of the most proactive leaders of all time hope it does not take toll on him deleted 
i have been getting calls from some organization called child help foundation and want to know if they are legit  www reddit com india comments ddy i have been getting calls from some organization so some lady called seema contacted me yesterday asking me to donate some money for some child operation was outside at the time and asked her to contact me later so she called me again today when asked her where she got my number from she is not replying on repeatedly asking she said some database but was very vague about it started asking her multiple questions about the disease and treatment and all she said she will send me pictures and documents about it but was once again very vague on asking her more questions about the hospital she kept saying they are legit and the child needs help when bluffed and said that since am journalist let me do some background check and get back to you she sounded little concerned and said okay and asked me to call back when can now have been doing some research and found website and all for this but there is absolutely no buzz on the thing they want to the fact that it seems made up found something about the child she mentioned and apparently the surgery was scheduled for yesterday so dunno why she is calling me today also found similar letter of appeal from the doctor she mentioned by name but for another child don know lot of things about this whole thing seem fishy tl dr wanted to know if anyone has gotten call from some seema or anyone else from child help foundation asking for donation for child called sia samanta who operation costs lakhs if it is fake am legit going to journalist friend and tweeting to the cops about this shit along with her number and all so they don exploit other people  no one would ask random people for money if some kid is undergoing operation this only happens in bollywood if were in your place wouldn take second to hang up also got similar call it was regarding the treatment of year old kid suffering from cancer asked them to mail me the details and pic of the victim they did but still had my concerns said wanted to visit the hospital myself and he ws fine with that too gave me the address and all gave rs but the thing is the calls just kept pouring in after that like every month donating such amount once every now and then is fine but you should not make business out of it they started demanding larger sum so declined them in strict tone now dont get the calls but still have my doubts about their legitimacy if somebody calls you and you don know them and they are not somebody you have to talk to for work just hang up don entertain them these people are not legitimate remember somebody posting very similar case few months ago maybe if you search for it you ll be able to find it these cases are very common you know your situation best but would urge you not to get involved further by tweeting to the cops ha got call the other day here what said see if am donating then should be able to choose who to help and since have only so much to give can help everybody so when you call me and ask me for money for kids then it puts me in spot such that become the bad guy if don donate she had absolutely nothing to say after this monologue and she said okay and hung up okay wtf got similar call too from some foundation was too busy to pay attention so just told her ll get back to her later but she did mention something about kid with leukemia who needs money 
please help me out  www reddit com india comments drnqk please help me out hello india this post is bit personal just need help and some mental peace if my sentences are bit incoherent please forgive me because m overwhelmed with emotions at the moment so here begins my story m was born and brought up in kerala got through the medical entrance exam and took up medical seat in maharashtra didn have any problems but felt homesick finally got over it and started studying for my future in medicine the first semester in ist b s goes very good my problems begin in the second semester where start having issues with my health during this period consulted many doctors m unstable and bed ridden taking multiple pain killers and muscle relaxants prescribed by them the doctors aren able to give me diagnosis few months pass keep in mind even in such state m studying give my prelim examination and barely make it m geared up to give my ist b s exam my health takes turn for the worst and now m unable to move my parents come all the way from kerala they aren able to see me in such state and they take me back to kerala they get me checked up and within days the competent doctor gives me the diagnosis have b spine my parents are shell shocked my mother starts crying felt numb felt helpless my treatment schedule is put in place and start with my medication the treatment plan was for year with physiotherapy luckily the vertebrae involved ankylosed without causing need for surgical involvement healed physically now my treatment was done was healthy but during this period all the friends had made in my college were now strangers had become social pariah didn disclose my illness except to close friend who was also from kerala he kept me updated on what was going on in college even though he had moved to the second year had completed my treatment and had to sit for the ist b s exam with months left after my treatment give it my all and with the grace of god make it through now begins the second year m with completely new batch became junior nobody knows who am thought get fresh start but slowly the news spreads and they get to know that m from their senior batch initially they assumed was transfer initially people tried making small talk with me and was soon friends with few of the people from this batch slowly was isolated and my seniors wanted nothing to do with me was completely alone even my close friend got busy with his life and abandoned me aswell my parents kept asking me how the new batch was and if had adjusted lied to them just to make them feel better that everything was perfect keep in mind my parents are doctors and they have extremely busy schedules and didn want to burden them further now somehow have kept myself together with the support of my parents the only people talk to are my parents somehow made it through the second and third year aswell now m in my final year this year has been nerve wracking all do is study eat and sleep m completely alone all the ridicule face from my batchmates and juniors has got me all messed up for something that wasnt my fault at all don know who can trust anymore have no one in my life besides my family there is only so much can take m in another state away from home questioning my sanity my batchmates are now in internship they ll graduate soon everyday keep thinking what had done to deserve this keep thinking is it worth it to even live anymore why should pain myself to become doctor at all under such pathetic conditions why should have to live with this if this is how the society is d rather be dead  your mental help doesn seem to be good go to psychologist or psychiatrist it really helps lot you don need to have friends you can spend time doing things you love writing blogging playing games and often traveling alone went through years of my engineering without having proper friends in my college had mental problems used to do self harm and once broke my head with glass you just need to hang in there mate never ever give up go hit the gym it helps to understand its difficult but hold your head high and finish your studies people will always talk and as doctors of the future its quite ridiculous on their part don have any advice to offer as this is not due to any fault of your own but my dms are open if you ever need someone to talk to or just listen you are in your final year now soon you ll graduate too don worry about those who don value you you probably won ever meet them once you become professional doctor don think about others just think about yourself now and if you can take some time out then try to invest that time in some hobby you ll meet friends too maybe later in your life the past is not under your control but the future is so focus on that be confident ll also suggest getting professional help please try that too think this is an opportunity to make friends outside of the current potential new friend circle meet people from other walks of life make friends with the nearest restaurant owner meet bankers cas join an activity group find friends from other fields of study none of these guys would likely matter once you graduate if you are doing well in studies eventually someone will join you in group studies make it happen op man don you have laptop or something to watch movies or play games by yourself being alone isn the worst thing in the world everything is okay don feel bad about anything you have gone through firstly accept the fact what you are now the thing is you are feeling shy about the things happened to you accept them everything flows with the time

reddiquette and be kind to each other this is thread meant for support and will be moderated off topic comments will be removed  deleted money makes many things and one thing for sure is hatred between relatives this thread is just in time for what had on my mind the whole day how do you deal with the reality of your parents getting older yesterday evening saw my father come back home and just wind down as he usually does and for the first time seeing him made me feel this dread in the air he growing old no he is old could see the toll time has taken on him wish had better words to describe my thoughts now know this didn happen overnight and yesterday wasn any different than any other day in past few months years but felt this helpless fear seeing this man who carried the weight of family so well for decades now labouring to push through another day folks how do did you deal with this is there anyone belonging to no hugs family here e one where no one ever hugs someone else in the family wish my folks just got divorced know life would have been very different maybe worse if that happened but at least wouldn be so socially fucked up as grown adult from age all can remember is my parents not even talking to each other my dad is piece of shit fine my mom struggled lot to give me and my brother better life which really appreciate but honestly in retrospect feel divorce would have been better than all of us just living in one house like bunch of roommates who just talk to each other about things like dinner is ready should switch off the lights etc even today cannot understand how normal family functions mean cannot process it when my friends say they are just going to the park with their parents or going on holiday with their family cannot understand it cannot process bunch of people in family sitting around table and just talking about their day and shit if ever have kids am going to make sure they don suffer as did seriously would be parents who are reading this if you start hating each other just get divorce and move on it has lasting effects on the child how many of you have lost perfectly normal loving uncles aunts parents cousins due to radicalisation by hate messages fake news on whatsapp shit news how do you handle them how to handle family occasion is there hope your thoughts on arranged marriages dread the prospect of marrying stranger someone whom ll never be able to love am year old man and all of sudden missing friendship with my guy friends all my friends have gotten married moved abroad or just decided not to be my friend for religious reasons do not have guy friend who can talk to one on one or just ask out for movie or drink am still in touch with my female friends and speak to them once in while but when it comes to guys don have anyone in india could call friend deleted any stories of overprotective helicopter parents hi all did not think my first post in years will be for relationship support will try to keep it as short as possible am year old male who joined bank yrs ago after completing mba when joined my father had passed away just months back and being the eldest sibling wanted to marry and settle down as soon as possible to take over responsibilities of my family among other people another girl aged right now also joined with me at delhi location liked her from the beginning and after being friends with her and pursuing relationship with her for months she finally said yes to me in last may although she said yes always felt that she was not really sure about me she sometimes also said it outright and thought with time she will like me more and this feeling will go away in sep last year she moved to hyderabad to work for an fmcg company and we decided to try long distance till jan this everything was okay would visit her and then she visited me as well we sometimes had fights over communication problems but then would talk sense into each other and moved forward jan was the last time visited her once got back got stressed out due to multiple family problems which wont get into and in addition that nagging feeling that she was not really sure decided to end it and called her we discussed it lot and then decided to end our relationship in feb end as soon as did it realized made mistake but didnot call her back because was the one proposed to end it but lo and behold after days she says she is in delhi and wants to meet me we met and decided to give it one more try now from march to may end we had good moments and bad moments but according to me these were normal communication issues of long distance told her to come to hyderabad but she would make excuses and all on may called her and she was not showing lot of interest for last days so told her to call when she wanted to talk and hung up days passed and no call ultimately called her and asked she was behaving like we were done with each other and she said yes we are done and hung up it was so shocking that got so angry that also decided to end it however after more days called her and told her if we are going to end it we should end it on good note and wished her best of luck for her future and she did the same at this point of time it was july and thought we were not made for each other but started missing her lot and atlast messaged her on july that wanted to meet to discuss and wanted to get back together she remained very adamant she had interest in me now had moved on and should also do so but kept poking her and atlast she told me that she had gone on trip with her mba friends in jan this year and had started developing feeling for another guy who was in batch of her mba college she tried to supress those feelings and tried to be with me but couldn do so and when we stopped talking on may decided that we were done and now wanted to move forward this guy from her college is in same company in chandigarh earns better has good career prospects than me and they ofcourse have more common friends now did some more digging and found that she had come to delhi to go to mcloedganj with this guy on may without telling me just days after she stopped talking to me ofcourse they would have planned it while while she was all lovey dovey with me she says they went in group although dont trust her since there were no pics on any social media confronted her and now she has blocked me on fb insta whatsapp everywhere also all this confrontation happened only on messaged and she never picked my call and refused to meet me years have passed since joined my company my career is going nowhere sidelined my family responsibilities for her am now grey haired balding fat slob who still has strong feelings for girl and still wants to be with her after getting cheated on all my friends say should have seen it coming or should have committed more time to her cherry on the cake was she asked to tell about us to noone so none of our common friends knew about us till last week and now she is telling everyone that she always told me that she was not sure about me and tried with me but it did not work out dont really know where to go from here miss her and still pathetically in love with her am having hard time with my boyfriend when we met he was virgin and had promiscuous past we fell in love for the sake of honesty told him about my past but not all just told him that had two exs he accepted it and it was all good one day he snooped through my facebook and dug his way through every single flirt crush whatever of my past that day he lost all respect and love for me and has been treating me with as much respect as you would hooker the thing is according to me it was my past and hid it because he wouldn understand his reaction proved me right he thinks hid those things because was stringing him along we both tried to breakup several times but it didn happen we work together we live together now our parents are searching for venues for marriage and we are so

was told to not play sports as no one would marry me if my complexion turned dark sania mirza one of india most successful tennis players reflects on the challenges she faced as child  scroll in field was told to not play sports as no one would marry me if my complexion turned dark sania mirzanan marriage the society can see anything other than that clearly that warning turned out to be false india heartthrob also the reason why indian men started taking special interest in tennis this is one of examples of colonial hangovers still see examples of aunties saying arre uska rang kitna saaf hai the moment you say that you are unconscious implying that being dark is being dirty pathetic was never allowed to play outside after st grade for the same reason ve ha sad childhood kudos to her bro pakistan jaake shadi karni padi tujhe i don like her she is pretentious obviously yes she is successful tennis players and she always try to win for india today is birth date and wish you happy birthday to sania mirza www sunsigns org famousbirthdays profile sania mirza colour is the not the first thing you notice when you see sania mirza ʖ says the girl who married cricketer from where again aha the k make up kit wali that not exclusive to you santa ji tanning is not problem but hyperpigmentation is and sun exposure leads to hyperpigmentation in some individuals like pigmentation around the eyes freckles mouth etc also sun is very harmful for our skin so would recommend do not go out in the sun especially girls because female skin is more prone to hyperpigmentation and sun damage and it is very difficult to treat hyperpigmentation of indian and black skin tones if your parents advised you to not go in the sun at an early age for whatever reason indirectly they did favour to you but if you still want uneven skin tone then that your choice and do you guys think sania mirza never went to dermatologist for skin treatments can tell by looking at quality of her skin that she did had treatments and all of these treatments make your skin fairer then it was before treatment although not fair then your natural complexion

think seriously of bio ethical issues arising therefrom better go the nature way though we have got freedom we can use it either way shows great decline in ethical and value understanding forgetting what our ancestors the great rishis and developing slavish western educated attitude so called modern doom is near when we forget ours roots this is very very healthy sign that the times we are livin in is not as for the rishis if this gentleman had the time to look into our scriptures he would find the ardhanarishwara form which celebrates feminity countless other refutes could be provided it high time we step up the ante and counter them these kind of mentality would only cause our society to move towards an intellectual dark age m simply surprised that every divine pronouncement is taken

we are not perfect www reddit com india comments esrg we are not perfect  just an average boy in college with messed up life so the other day overheard my parent conversation about me where basically my dad went on to rant about how have basically achieved nothing in life while kids my age having no financial support have done wonders and ve come to realize how indian society mocks and pressurize teenagers to be at the top while completely ignoring the fact that not everyone has to be perfect and there is no shame in admitting that we are full of flaws and m hope people come up with things they want to say about themselves not being perfect here ll start m cant even ride bicycle and m afraid to drive and literally do not like any kind of sports edit this post is not about me complaining or whining about my parents neither is it about seeking redressal for being failure in life becauselets be honest we veheard that crap ton of times its more about accepting the way you are because here in india every judge you from you looks to your talents to your abilities its okay not to be special because large portion of people are above you sometimes being bad at something everyone expects you to bd good at or something that everyone is good at and your not is okay  m and unemployed m and my self esteem is still tied to approval from others s and have zero ambition and drive m years old didn get into iit my dad stopped comparing me with others after was raged asf and started comparing him his salary our assets etc with my friends fathers and his friends since that day ve never felt soo good am and scared to drive unconditional love is scam your parents girlfriend also have certain conditions when they will love you you have to have certain job looks satisfy their expectations when they will love you found that recently m by our society standards d be considered an achiever and fucking fought really hard for it after an extremely abusive and poor childhood but have anxiety issues people don understand it though and anxious to drive car after bad accident have ambition but no dedication am extremely lazy am and your dad is dumb m and no idea what to do and scared about the future all the time am have very very big aims in life but not even moving finger to achieve it m and still in college m my man haven driven anything ever here more no friends nearby have friends but not one single friend whom can call up anytime have no job am working on my software product so living with parents for past year no money read above point father probably hates and sees me as failure he also thinks m not man enough because of next two points short for guy ish skinny af never kissed or even had anything resembling girlfriend did miss anything hates driving but is pressurized into doing it there too much pressure to be special mean somewhere here only you ll find someone saying no but you re different you re not like everyone else is it that bad to be an average person think it okay to be okay well to all the boys the only thing can say having lived in pg in mumbai sharing the room with strangers and surviving on diet ofvada pav is this it okay to be dejected it okay to feel like complete failure it okay to not find love it okay to have disappointed parents it okay not to have money it okay to do stupid job it okay that no one gets you it okay it okay but never stop learning never give up never ever and be strong be humble be kind fuck society that tries to measure you especially that of your parents you re you no one can compare you but they will do that at every step they think it their job and they will be persistent and passionate about it so you better develop some serious belief in defying them and believing in yourself instead of sucking up to their judgment tell yourself this growing up in this sick society means developing thick enough skin where you don care shit about such opinions and hope you grow into person that defined by you and you take pride in what you re striving for your personality your yardstick everything else can go get fuck itself its this attitude of parents that leads to teen suicides am sorry not trying to be rude about your parents but stating the facts can we get s in chat completed my undergrad and pursuing ca and cs cleared intermediate exams for both with good score but m not even interested in the commerce field absolutely no idea what to do with my life and currently just going with the flow wtf are you supposed to achieve at ve just popped in from the exchange with ireland hope that ok felt the same at dropped out of college and all that jazz got lucky with job got qualified picked up some hobbies and now m putting myself back through college take it as it comes if you re not progressing in one aspect of life pick something else to move on in can professionally move up for another year or so so ve entered into relevant courses started diving and learning new things as time goes on you ll see the similarities in how you feel and how everyone else acts everyone is doing the same thing just be trying most parents think that millennials are dumb and are taking our nation to shit due to their smartphone and pubg addiction but in reality it the politicians voted by everyone including older generation tell him it his genetics all the overachievers usually have intelligent parents this will really piss him off m can drive haven even bothered to learn to cycle you have all your life screw that shit is not even that old you ve technically not even started adult life m bought my first car this year can drive hate all sports the idea of going to the gym makes me wanna cry m and broke same here when we were your age we already had you when we were your age we had built house of our own when we were your age we had stable job when we were your age when you were my age the country wasn going to the dogs when you were my age the country wasn going to run out of water in the next years when you were my age things weren as politically fragile as they are today when you were my age the economy hadn collapsed from top to bottom when you were my age huge unemployed youth population wasn out either protesting for more jobs or slitting each other throats for one your time was different accept it and move on am from pakistan and faced same issue am now and after finishing bachelors years ago had hard time getting job like everyone else my father used to mock me each and everyday that you are failure and you will never achieve shit in your life he used to say so by comparing me with one neighbor guy who got good job as developer had skills and did job which quit after months because my boss was dick had been full time freelancer soon after my studies and when started earning more than that developer neighbor then all the mockery stopped all of sudden and became their most faithful and successful son am currently doing my dream job outside country and living in company provided apparent with family will never forget those mockeries and will never have respect for my father which wish could have sought my father approval for the first years of my life in the last months ve been depressed and suicidal due to feeling like there was no hope for happiness in my future realised any father who put his daughter in position to choose between her own happiness and pleasing him is not good parent stopped giving fuck about his approval took lot of time and therapy but it worked against his desires moved out of the country to find future for myself and m struggling financially struggle for food but m happier than ve ever been in all my life seeking validation and approval lead to no where there will always be someone brighter better and wealthier than you that people will compare you to they will never be proud of what you ve achieved and they don need to you need to be happy with yourself and honestly that has changed my life never thought could be that person edit m and know how to drive because got my license but never drive car because im not confident m with drop year in the first year itself under average in studies physically ugly virgin never kissed or hugged had girlfriend for years and turns out it was one sided from my side can drive car but can ride activa have really supportive bestfriend but don treat her right my behaviour goes toxic when anyone proves me wrong feel your pain but if you re willing to learn find quiet place and friend to help if you can and wake up early like am early and learn it it should hardly take days m have job but am lazy as fuck very poor with my finances afraid that m gonna end up alone first time huh hear that rant everyday its to the point where it doesn even affect me practically live with existential crisis and top that with being an introvert no one is perfect but our society doesn understand simple fact that not everyone can become the top in rat race that only favours the academically superior but we apparently can do anything do about it so just go with the flow pretend it the rainy season of your life it ll pass and the sun will shine one day just keep on trying m got rejected by my crush day before yesterday self esteem is pretty low and seeing others like me on reddit makes me genuinely happy it interesting as canadian of indian immigrants seeing the youth of india questioning aspects of indian culture it similar to what kids of expats went through when our parents first moved away not that the globe is smaller and ideas proliferate so quickly indian youth are going through the same cultural revolution that we dealt with still one foot firmly planted in tradition while the other desperately dragging itself to new reality only offer the advise that stay true to yourselves there is merit in buying into the system but don be defined by it play music draw pictures and do the other things that are frowned upon cuz ye saab se paisa nahi aiga also understand better the pressures previous generations felt and so it natural for them to push on to their kids treat your parents with kindness for they know not what they do they too are struggling with how the world has changed before them bro start driving using small automatic hatchback it so easy to drive and also have big red stickers on your car you can remove it once you learn how to drive usually people understand when they see the sticker and will give you way and won criticize you wake up at am and learn to drive on empty roads first once you get the hang of it go into usual traffic have seen people drive with stickers for even upto months but make sure you learn to drive car before you finish college it ll be absolutely necessary even experienced f drivers would be scared shitless when they drive for the first time in indian traffic screwed up and failed my car driving test and that saying something as our country driving test is an absolute joke and is perhaps one of the easiest tests out there in this world of ours this happened when was around years of age almost years back mean had hopes and aspirations that would have obtained license asap the moment turned well it sucks suppose for life to not turn up the way one hopes too even if they give their darnest best to make it happen guess my neuroticism and anxiety ruined that test for me on that fateful day prior to reaching the testing grounds my instructor made me do trial on the roads which did good job of and he assured me that ll surely pass the test as long as maintain my cool and composure but he couldn accompany me on the grounds and instead another instructor who had no clue of my temperament and personality came and he didn help things for me for every minor mistake made he kept belittling me dismissing my anxiety and nervous attitude and told me as to how seemed to be the weakest out there when compared to other candidates who came along with me and thus was completely demoralised and failed the test everyone present on the ground were laughing at me for my ineptitude in handling the vehicle did not speak with anyone on that day m and still haven learnt to drive just saying was afraid to drive and have never ridden bicycle till this summer got job and was about to move to bangalore knew that had to learn it and if stay afraid now ll hate myself for this in future so in span of months learnt how to ride bicycle then scooty and car back to back sometimes the motivation comes from necessity let me see o male cant drive any motorized vehicle cant dance cant party cant be social some dumb fuckery by someone always flips me off in quest to learn as much as possible so that makes me prick dont watch movies dont like eating dont particularly travelling in big groups obsessive planner not so much on the execution side one decent relationship that lasted months xb note can and do ride bicycles and do trek solo started this recently my dad made me drive when was now and got involved in minor accidents and naturally developed fear of driving cars can drive two wheelers fine but they still mock for not being able to drive car honestly this is more because of breakdown in communication than anything lot of indian parents are great at raising and talking to their kids till they re but seem to completely lose it after that its important to note that you can control or govern your kids lives as they get older and that they still need unconditional help and support from their parents kids are too afraid of their parents to say no when they get forced into following some field or career and parents are too focused on the future to see what happening with their kids in the here and the now that being said the kid themselves isn blameless lot of bright minded smart kids just lose the will to study work perform and there is little their teachers or parents can do to understand if there is no communication as for you op if you have clear idea of what you wanna do in life then let your parents know about it let them understand that you have goal that you re working towards an aim that you want to achieve they may be bullheaded about it but they still want the best for you using my throwaway porn account because don want my irl friends to find out about his ever final year of bca since m failure not engineer my school friends consider me failure and try really hard to hide that because that don want to hurt me or maybe m insecure idk still live with my parents and regret not living out on my own at least once every week know m not stupid m always one of the first ones to build up logic for program m good at few things but have never achieved anything in my life used to score in schools and hence have trouble with my self image in this aspect if m smart who just sucks at studies or if m dumb and just pretending to be smart current college is shitty as fuck have grown to hate this city because want to live away from it my dressing sense sucks but try to mask it with an don care what wear attitude m supposed to be preparing for mca which if done from good college is the only way can start earning have studied nothing in last days and my mca entrance is months away had told my pune friends that ll be visiting them around th of december but now m having second thoughts because of not studying m not prepared at all for this feel like m gonna be fuckup and the worst part of this is m not even trying to change things have gaming problem when m left with games stop prioritizing things and play it till everything else is collapsed last time spiraled out on my gaming thing ended up scoring really bad for my th exams hence didn take engineering m really self critical self conscious and self loather not proud of it there is something wrong with me psychologically but don know what parents won understand what therapy is typical you re not crazy try going out more mentality don blame them for it have planned to get therapy with my own money once start earning which won be anytime soon know won do it but passively think that if don settle down by or atleast start to settle down will kill myself again won do it have felt suicidal twice in my life and didn even try to harm myself those two times don even know why m posting this here guess just need to vent didn get into iit even after taking drop have zero friends and no accomplishments never had gf total waste of parents money dude that pressure will always be there irrespective of your age today it is abt your studies tommorow it will be abt job then about marriage and kids stood up to my dad only after engineering finally got the balls to say that want to do business and not want to work in mnc he listened to me for the first time after that full blown argument now he encourages read pressure me to expand my business turned today absolutely no direction in life have no idea what really like doing most of us deal with this on daily basis correct me if m wrong we could all use hug right now but only thing that keeps me going is no matter how hard or shitty day gets it doesn last more than hours feel slightly better knowing that hopefully this changes the way you perceive things well m teacher wage about rs per month year old lazy but hard working have dream of becoming an scientist or programmer but dream crushed by the same people the comparisons to other people of your age is normal and everyone has faced this in their life note that am saying everyone has faced this doesn mean that it is right and in the contrary it is detrimental on the mindset of how we are brought up the fact is that after our parents do this comparison some people don give damn after certain age but some people still end up comapring themselves with their peers yep nobody is perfect but we have to do something meaningful in the world to earn our living etc how do you want to earn your living and lead your life should be up to you and you alone imho if it comes down to something down something along the lines of sharmaji kya sochenge to kahiye sharmaji khud ke baare me soch lein hum apna dekh lenge the way you wrote your post it seems you stopped before you even started you really are not perfect are you comrade m and can afford car forget driving anything m cant even ride bicycle and m afraid to drive and literally do not like any kind of sports that my description except m oh man that line and can ride bicycle hit me am wasn able to ride bicycle but few months back made up my mind that will learn after week was able to ride little bit now can ride motorbike not perfect and also have started focusing on my life learned python and have started focusing on study would also like to mention flunked in maths in so would like to say its never too late to change graduated last year was working at job d landed through campus placements but quit because big dreams preparing for very unpredictable exam with no back ups whatsoever no idea what going to happen if my plan falls apart im and haven spoken to girl in over months m and m alone m and can speak to someone immediately new especially if they are girls or someone of greater my age m and feel you financial freedom will get you out of misery try doing things that can get you some money here and there stock trading and shit once you start making enough on the side to help with some expenses at home meanwhile you do stuff for yourself nobody will say shit honestly feel like people need to know this one trick it is shame that you feel that way unfortunately indian parents have tendency to push their own fragile ego and aspirations on their kids there is absolutely nothing wrong with you and don let the things that your parents say get inside of your head get job become financially independent and move out just do not continue to engage in the toxicity of your parents otherwise things will only become worse for you am around moved to europe decades ago for it work which am still doing lot of my friends in india some didn even finish school are now vastly better off that me financially two owns businesses and employs people at least have amassed so much wealth land properties that they could retire any day they want have years left on my mortgage here am not complaining though have very good life m and can drive but m gonna get back to practice soon graduated with an engineering degree at from national top school but working hard to re enrol in good college so can finally study things ve always wanted to have lean built but never made serious effort to get buff physique as always found gyms expensive promised myself will get over my discomfort and go to the gym every day when get into college and finally have time again failed nd year of med school taking break for one year dad says he ashamed of me and wouldn talk to me ve been sent to another city because he can stand seeing my face or hearing my voice can talk to people my own age or people in general for that matter even for small talk m overweight m and supposed to crack jee but don know shit about solving those kind of problems jee starts on jan fml and can drive because hit my face on an iron fence while learning safe to say m perpetually petrified of vehicles and fences also intrusive thoughts does anyone else deal with thoughts that lead to brutal death while driving without anything even happening or is it just me lol m and never been in real romantic relationship wtf is wrong with me the worst thing is the disappointment more than unemployment you see on the other fucking faces that we ve let them down voluntarily suddenly we become the bad guy fuck this society m in my rd year of engineering feel like complete shit my parents are supportive of my decisions but give up things when the going gets tough for example competitive coding and divert myself with porn or reddit do not have routine lack consistency and discipline but want to get rid of this lethargic feeling that get man m loosing control over my actions any advise would be appreciated kind randians choose non medical but dont wanna join iit s fell from my scooter once it wasn a big fall neither was it very serious but couldn bring myself to drive two wheeler again learnt to drive my car once couldn start my car on time after the green light and don need to explain the commotion created at that time which scared me lot and im too scared to drive now also my left leg feels like it will fall off in pain due to me controlling the clutch in heavy bangalore traffic so im lazy and untalented according to my parents lol ok parents im your child who has your genes also using public transport is better for the environment exams after two days and haven completed anything properly am and have zero self confidence and even though have been performer before now am just really scared of going on stage and its funny because in my life all wanted was to be on stage performing s am trained dancer still studying this website is weird af m cant even ride bicycle and m afraid to drive and literally do not like any kind of sports sports never knew indian parents gave two shits about sports play anything you will get flying hc verma on your face deleted indians parents are one of the worst in the world am lpm guy but my failure count is much more than success count sure society does put pressure but don use the anti thesis to just be lazy dream work for them else life is just pointless void without real higher purpose anyway bro just find out what you really like and work towards it it might be against their will but that how you can give an answer to them and to the society and still confused if want to become software engineer or musician mean love both but m not very good in either of them rather than think about what you are not good at think about what you like and are good at or can be good at you don judge horse by how fast it swims and fish by how fast it runs if you are not good at studies maybe you like cooking or art or sports or gardening etc find your passion don let negative opinion define you this is all direct result of capitalism tbh m years old and can do lot of things but unlike the losers who don want to put in the effort to be able to do those things genuinely want to improve and am working toward being what expect myself to be instead of whining about it on the internet in the mid s unemployed for over year no social life anymore skinny tall and bald very anxious about everything m good at driving just anxious failed driving test and hate myself to the core had social anxiety so talking to others really makes me nervous am so perfectly imperfect m in my late twenties and m rediscovering life after nearly decade of depression m still depressed of course but don have to let that define me or dictate who am or my actions ve been depressed so long that my childhood memories seem like they happened to someone else like was an observer to my own childhood but eventually the clouds will clear even if it seems impossible we will never be perfect but we will bear our crosses and carry on because that life suffering peppered with moments of joy pain heartbreak melancholy and loneliness you ll be alright we all will be its perfectly fine to be self aware and being comfortable with yourself but more importantly its necessary to try and fail rather than just being silent observer and judging other opinions if you have anything that keeps you awake at night you must pursue that coz it the effort that counts more than success usually dont like any sports thats just okay but are you an engineer abey fuck same logged in to tell you this learnt to cycle at age and now often bike kms to work hang in there dude you ll get there the way you wrote your post it seems you stopped before you even started you weren joking when you said you weren perfect comrade am m scared to learn to drive car also sometimes feel like ve wasted myself academically to the point that there no climbing back up for me also put off seeing psychologist cause feel anxious to even go lol moved to canada when was and long story short fucked some things up and came back to india years later now m battling depression still unemployed but trying my best listening to parents whining almost every sunday so you re good am and not able to drive bike recently learnt to ride scooty on street am graduated and got decent job with decent pay yet so doubts that not able to interact and have deep conversation with anyone easily lonely af still life is beautiful have been sharma ji ka beta kinda guy in whole life so can even complain like how op is talking about accepting ones faults while the comments are filled with suggestions on how to fix that fault thanks for proving his point m fat bmi and haven gotten promoted in looooong time am and cant talk to girls yea the irony being in relation to the post know what iam doing but it ain progressing fingers crossed as someone who disabled and struggles with mental health ve had lot of other things happen in my life that has made me feel in similar ways xb have developed very anticapitalist mindset as result fucking wholesome this thread m graduated in hotel management decided not to pursue the career did mba in marketing didn wanted to do field work did digital marketing course didn liked it so here am working in kpo as fresher on minimum wages clueless of what am going to do next oh and did tell that am socially awkward and virgin who never had girlfriend yeah that and sometimes hope for an alien invasion so that my society focus diverts from me m first year at iit severe body dysmorphia that tell no one about an ldr that m desperately invested in no friends in college read incel websites and find myself agreeing with bits and pieces of it feel terrible immediately afterwards we all drew tangent to the op conversation have heard countless stories of your loved ones comparing you to someone else feel so hopeless for such loved ones of mine they have spent all of their life comparing crying and living to fit in the society you have to this to make good name what will society think will you go marry girl pf different caste and make us look like we raised fool the core message is stop living for people and society start living for yourself hope to get this in my grand pa head someday you just copied my situation although m not guess some things about boomers never change you are not trying to achieve and like to stay remain where you are so not taking any chance to do new thing thats great people should accept you you are normal don listen other do what you want dropped out for years and did nothing with that time seeing all the people who are scared to drive think you could also blame indian roads and driving practices too hate driving because have terrible attention span but it doable as long as you take enough caution am trying to loose weight since am the other day saw fuckin rickshaws drive on the footpath ofc now m scared to drive m and m in college and just feel numb most of the time and m lacking self esteem and have zero ambition in life don know how m gonna get through this but m going to fucking get out of this shitty state that just bad parenting showing that your parents aren perfect either m and feel isolated in most social situations the few people am close with to the point where this isn a factor are toxic and make me worse version of myself want to make better more meaningful relationships but my low self confidence and insufficient social aptitude make it difficult xb am overweight and procrastinate alot am and very socially awkward have trouble talking with strangers and making new friends am and just want to die m and forget to take towel with me to the shower hi maybe can advise on what can do can i ve given neet times and haven got in the weak can never forgive forgiveness is the attribute of the strong mahatma gandhi okay guys will start practicing driving yet again this week ve been neglecting this due to the anxiety of driving car after near drove my car into marsh people who complain about generation forget who raised them expectation is two way street m and ve lost interest in life don give fuck about anything not even my parents haven cried properly in years thanks to extreme bullying and shaming in high school don get me wrong love life suicide is the last thing will ever think about but just want to have more confidence in myself m completely emotionless have interest in life in any aspect don play any game more than minutes don read book or topic more than lines and give up on task even before start just want to feel an emotion that be good hello there well hate to break it to you but you are not even at the worst stage of your life soon in few years you ll be pressured to get married and yes arranged and if you still don have job be ready to face the wrath of your parents yeah indian society mean of course they mean well but this isn the way man sometimes think what if become scientist or programmer should d be happy am too chickenshit to drive or ride bike thinking about dropping out of post grad am and was super scared to drive in india while my friends had their licenses and driving their cars used sit in the back seat it only when moved abroad learnt how to drive oh and also dont know how to ride bicycle bike or even swim m too and can think anything else other than just killing myself m and ve not saved my first million yet iit graduate didn learn thing about engineering no idea what to do with my life can relate buddy indian parents expect their children to be like satya nadela or bill gates when we tell them that we can they come up with bullshit stuff like look at that guy he had nothing and now he is insert high level title or we sacrificed so much for you at least do this or that am here are some of my flaws failures didn complete b tech from iit or b sc from st stephen i could never sort out my priorities as teenager so ended up attending decent ish du college instead do not work for mckinsey bain bcg amazon or google my family believes that am competent enough to reach great heights and try my best to make them proud but so far my path has only been full of disappointment my girlfriend whom wanted to spend the rest of my life with grew uncertain about the future of our relationship so ended things on bitter note in hindsight maybe couldn handle all the stress and acted rather impulsively still think about how could ve done better in that situation ve got no real friends whom can depend upon to always have my back there are plenty of friends but no one who will sit with me and genuinely inquire about my problems guess might ve taken the nicest people that came into my life for granted and now it impossible to completely fix that even through honest apologies it sucks to have to deal with all this but ve somehow learnt to find happiness in the small things more importantly choose to focus on becoming better version of myself everyday and not get too affected by my past maybe there is bigger plan that laid out for me and just can see it yet who knows cant drive extremely overweight borderline obese no zero ambition or drive for anything in life constant complainer and down in the dumps dummy hey dude feel like ve done nothing many times especially when perform lower than what others expect which is your case believe if thinking that indian society is shit and makes you feel shittier makes you feel better be it sometimes having certain opinion about something can make us fell better however you can hate on your parents or as matter of fact any blood relation always try to convince myself by thinking that most indian parents care more than parents in other cultures do it has its advantages and disadvantages m sure we do get lot more moral support sometimes not all than others but sometimes over expectations leads to such situations edit corrected spelling deleted my friend is years old at this moment he has never driven motorcycle in his entire life so far wholesome comments wish to see this kind of conversation m and unemployed my younger sibling is employed m just waste am and single for years

did you know  redd it exukvs jpgnan inb people belittle chhetri nobody sane thinks he is better than messi but to pass the goat in single metric with almost no support from anybody and playing in tier team is commendable xb before you rip on his opposition look up messi world cup goals most of them aren against top tier opposition either guys chill chetri is no way near to messi or ronaldo but on an international level he scored more goals internationally than messi it just how it is india is still budding when it comes to football we re on an amateur level and for position like this it a great achievement for chetri and indian football fans to be inspired and put in the effort like he did this stat doesnt prove that chhetri is comparable to ronaldo or messi it only proves how indebted indian football should be to him actually yes bro there is little bit of difference scoring against kennya and scoring against brazil don mean to belittle our captain but also don want to devalue messi apples and oranges chhetri is an asset to indian football but it is irrational to compare him to ronaldo and messi it is true that messi scored goals against shit teams but he also played and scored against strong teams under tremendous pressure chhetri goals have primarily been against tier teams but they have been valuable to indian football it is about having the level playing field and if we abandon that then this whole thing has little to no merit goals against bhutan in saff and goals against germany in the world cup aren same no didn people need to get over him being compared to ronaldo or messi know we go overboard when an indian does great and that can be annoying but in this case there is literally nothing wrong in this comparison because it just presenting the stats nobody in their right minds is saying he even comparable to either of them as player but to do this with the indian team setup if it child play to do this against other asian teams then other asian players should be at the top funny how they aren and to do it having better ratio than both of them ronaldo messi chhetri is commendable no matter how you slice it also don see how you can dismiss chhetri goals so easily if you can count ronaldo goals against andorra or messi against haiti you bet your ass you can count chhetri against maldives especially when you consider india isn comparable at all to portugal or argentina this is not an accurate metric though chhetri is great player but the teams he scored the goals against weren exactly world class were they imagine what portugal or argentina would do against tajikistan don want to be an asshole but scoring against weak teams is easier than strong european teams honest question do not follow football at all why do city based leagues like mu etc do not approach sunil chhetri to play for them we have got chhetri sunil chhetri just don think you understand oh when he scores we go fucking mad we have got sunil chhetri congrats to chettri but the the fact is that the intensity of the game played by messi and ronaldo is way too hard than the one chettri plays in all want to say is that this statistics is wrong given the fact that the international football association too knows it for real the contrasts of football around the globe in their respective continents cheers lol sunil has scored most of them against asian countries so many people having arguments xb the image suggests that statistically chhetri has scored more goals in international matches than messi it doesn matter against who he was playing against it a stats that all subscribe to indianfootball and join us on th when india take on north korea in the intercontinental cup क न ह भ ई य ल ग proud moment arey bc itni behas toh main muddo pe nahi hoti yeha jitni football pe ho rahe let upvote so that everyone could know just quick fyi for those guys slandering chhetri for scoring against small teams messi scored most of his goals in friendlies close to half and the competitive goals he scored too came in qualifiers or group stages rather than knockout stages as good player messi is especially in the club level chhetri contribution to his national team is far better than messi what sunil achieved is unbelievable also it unfair to portray messi as the no and rolando as the no messi does so much more than just score goals only those who follow barcelona argentina know this this picture can be very deceiving for non football fans this is cool little comic and get what op is doing for sunil but wish people would stop putting christiano whole ass rapist ronaldo on an actual pedestal did you know that this means nothing why does this comparison exist this is an extremely unfair comparison after watching ind vs turkmenistan game respect for chhetri has been doubled up as could not see any other player supporting him at his level don rely on chhetri to win games for you he has always done his job but you always loose when he doesn among active players fantastic achievement still indian football stalwart itt people knowing jackshit about football arguing he will surpass ronaldo one day so ronaldo chhetri messi removed who are these people have heard of only the one in red

how to get into sports and related activities after  www reddit com india comments axnb how to get into sports and related activities i am year old male and have recently finished college and started job in it throughout my childhood have been an introvert preferred staying inside my room watching movies and stuff when got into college whenever my friends asked me for outdoor games always excused myself know this was huge mistake as college gives you platform for learning these stuff you can call it laziness or shyness or lack of awareness or some other reason that doesn matter now since have started my job have realised the importance of these activities and want to learn them now but can seem to find any place that can help me learn all that at this age any help  this post summarised my life are you skinny too coz that will sum up me suggest shooting edit tartget shooting fuckin marksmanship post chutya start running mine was totally opposite till played cricket football badminton table tennis track field and hockey sometimes and was into ncc was like crazy into sports followed everything from nba to tennis to badminton to cricket etc etc they used to air sportscenter on espn india pm which would watch with full excitement played at district level and couple of cbse clusters so d say for my entire teen years liked to play and be outdoors most of the time going around riding bicycles and doing shit well sadly life took moved to different town lost all my school friends plus went out of state for college at college all of my interest got lost somehow and done nothing except binge and sleeping in other words turned into an extreme intorverted guy and felt comfortable around myself and started to grow my hair to look cool and headbang little well there one thing that helped me by playing different games was fitness football and badminton helped my leg muscles lot and think also helped my height ig haven been to gym to this day and don plan to because never needed to now btw life been depressed for the last years get emotional thinking how cool my teen life was now everything is shit good luck to you find outdoor activities useless lets say play cricket while batting hit shot some cringy kid shouts oyeee abe shai se bol fek na yaar just stand there and wobble my butt waste seconds waiting for another ball some kid does good fielding while the wicket keeper shouts are chaccha chaccha chacchaaaa chaccchhhaaaa oyeeee sahi hai sahi hai sahi haiiiii batsmen running with their balla and wobbling butt ballers shouting oooyeeee after every ball fielders clapping because there is nothing else to do outdoor activities are super mega cringy for me feel like smashing my bat on the face of every player that shouts or claps because he has to do something and can not stand idle starting off is the hardest part pick sport and try to get into it you should be able to find badminton tennis cricket academies fairly easily find sports complex or the kind or move to building with clubhouse that ll be good start d recommend gym but typical indian gyms are filled with steroid junkies and steroid recommending trainers specially when you re skinny have recently started learning badminton the fuckers who play well try to fuck with you showing their game off the best way is to not lose your will to learn and focus on getting as good as them and bearing them know people who started learning tennis when played fairly well and started bearing me in months there are good technical guides to each sport online by saying that o is too late to start playing is very lame excuse get your lazy ass up and start playing game in which you have interest you can start with tt badminton etc am assuming you don go to gym so you can start focusing on your physique by joining gym first few weeks would be tough but once you get past it then it will get easier but seriously dude get your lazy ass to work try playo app the more you play the quickly you learn also you can play squash it is one of the few games which you can learn playing solo op first of all why do you want to get into sports you say you have realized it is important don deny the benefits but what is your end goal is it something specific like playing at professional level or just something to keep you active and engaged if it is the latter learn like how child would just by playing it for fun find some of your colleagues who go for playing sports and ask them to tag you along for game regularly do that you will not only learn the sport gradually but you ll have fun doing it as well not to mention that it will vastly improve your social circle really depends on where you re from but there always coaching centers for most sports no age is too late to join these classes my uncle started table tennis coaching at years age and now he addicted to it you gotta spend money but that money is definitely worth it in the long run what do like to do most if like cricket hang out near cricket grounds and start talking to them they can always use an extra player same with any other sports if don ask wont get it start making progress little by little is still young to give up bowling it is really fun advice from year old guy smoked from years to years realised its huge mistake and here is how got into active sports stopped smoking cold turkey started running small distances and sprints progressed and completed two half marathons bought bike cycle and along with running ride kms if you can bike daily then on weekend ride kms it looks daunting but your legs will get used to it start badminton start swimming schedule times running times badminton times bike times swimming now start looking into marathons dualthon traithlon forget social media and open account in starva follow people and sync your activities there if at years could do it you are just and can definitely do it good luck honestly it ll be very tough for you to get into sport at this age assume you want to play with people your age cause it ll be weird for you to play with school kids right unfortunately most people your age would be those who actively enjoy the sport and have been playing for many years they ll be way better than noob and you won be able to develop your skills to good enough level to enjoy playing with them

i f can decide if my bf m is showing red flags and doesn respect me enough or if m being too insecure and not trusting him enough www reddit com india comments duped ifcant decide if my bfm is showing red flags hey ladies and gentlemen need some urgent advice about my relationship as soon as possible ve been member of this subreddit for quite sometime now and ve noticed you guys giving awesome advice to eachother f met my boyfriend m an year and half ago basically signed up on dating site for the first time ever and deactivated it within days he saw me on there and found me on facebook we chatted for bit and he asked me out he met my dad and ve met his mom and we are both serious about getting married in the near future so m from south asian muslim background and he from south asian hindu background he not religious at all am bit religious not too much though and the religious differences don bother me bit last year my boyfriend coworker female friend had bad date she invited guy to her place got drunk he wanted to have sex and she refused so he left she asked my bf to hangout with her at am on the same night because she was upset her date left he told me about this and went to her place then they went to the beach got uncomfortable and asked my bf if could speak to her he told me could message her on fb and did politely asking her about what happened that night she got really upset made very racist comment about me to my bf and after replying nothing happened we just hung out he a friend of mine blocked me then she kept texting my bf to ask how m doing my boyfriend told me asked him why he didn defend me and he said couldn attack her because she is girl didn want to make things awkward at office asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed she still following him on instagram though so here the thing whenever ve brought up any concerns regarding this relationship in the past my boyfriend has done all he could to ease my mind recently he made new group of friends he plays sports with every weekend they re all indian so my bf gets along with them really well they ve begun to invite him out to bars and nightclub parties almost every week now last weekend they invited him to bollywood party at nightclub in la the guys went with their girlfriends and my bf knew very well couldn accompany him since live at home with my parents and m not allowed to go out to clubs and bars until have my own place he asked me if m okay with it and told him to go and have fun he then told me all about how his friends got black out drunk also him and good college friend of his vacationed in las vegas last year for weekend before he left he kept telling me his friend was going to hire an escort and visit strip clubs bf said the most he do is probably get lap dance at strip club just for his friend they rented car together and bf told me his friend wants to pick up girls in the ferrari before he left told him m not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip once he got back asked him about his trip and he didn mention escorts or strip clubs asked him about his friend and he said his friend didn get an escort my bf just told me yesterday that he planning on spending new year eve with the same friend this year in miami am very concerned because honestly don think this friend is good influence haven brought this up to my bf yet ve just been thinking about this alot lately do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend place until am at night doing sheesha hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until am and vacationing in las vegas is good idea is this lifestyle common for people in the united states am being too conservative inflexible any advice or your thoughts anything at all would really help tl dr can decide if my bf is showing red flags and doesn respect me enough or if m being too insecure and not trusting him enough you two are not match there is nothing wrong in your expectations or his behaviour they are all choices people make he seems certain about what he wants you too are certain and when he crosses those lines you are uncomfortable relationship is about compromise but compromise even if grudging initially has to finally become one of happy acceptance otherwise the insecurities will eat away at it slowly he doesn seem to be particularly compromising to me you seem to be compromising but very uncomfortably if possible meet therapist have few sessions good therapist helps you clarify your own feelings and communicate them to yourself that will help you decide is india going to be relationship consultancy sub wow this is toughie your insecurity is very valid but at the same time can really see anywhere your boyfriend incurred any serious red flags m sorry about the way his female friend coworker treated you that isn right and you were right to ask him to not meet with her anymore would never date anyone whose friends gave me any racist comments of any kind and m sure it wasn in joking manner so kudos on that and as for the instagram thing wouldn worry too much unless he is known to be very active on instagram many people just have the app installed and look at it from time to time not really paying attention to who they follow or who is following them here is where the real advice for you lies when your boyfriend was vacationing in las vegas for hiring escorts and visiting strip clubs you said in your own words and quote before he left told him m not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip can understand giving your partner space but giving your boyfriend permission to go to strip club even if it makes you uncomfortable reeks of insecurity if giving your boyfriend permission to go to strip club makes you uncomfortable would very much be uncomfortable with my partner going to strip club even with friends then ask him to stop this is very legitimate request and especially more so in your case since you two are thinking of getting married soon going forward would ask what your boyfriend is doing in miami as well as any situation and want to ask yourself am uncomfortable with where my boyfriend is going and what he is doing if yes why if you have legitimate reason hint escorts and strip clubs are very much legitimate reason then address it to him in clear straightforward manner remember communication is key in relationships and marriages as for whether your boyfriend friend is good influence or not it tricky namely because you may not like the lifestyle but the other party is free to make their own choices because on one hand you may think they aren but another hand you don want to overstep your boundaries telling your partner that friend is bad influence can be seen as controlling unless the friend has been known to inflict emotional and or physical pain on your partner so wouldn worry too much about the friend until the friend puts strain on your relationship which makes it pertinent to discuss what you think about him so going forward would advise you communicate to your partner about how you feel where he is going and what he is doing don be afraid to have discussion on it communicate communicate communicate he seems to simply be from more liberal background than you there will be unavoidable culture shock involved just ask yourself whether you can tolerate it then discuss it with your fiance following that you may also talk to your own friends and family to ease matters and good luck now is the time to contemplate and avoid any forseeable emotional trauma it is difficult to understand what your or your bf thinks since its not clear of both of are born and bought up in us or born in india and are living in us for last few years or born in indian and moved to us as child that defines the characteristics and let other understand the mentality as an indian guy living in us it is common to be attracted to the western culture and be able to be part of it getting lap dance is common practice but escort is not when bf or gf starts making comments on things that their partner hadn thought about it is normal for your partner to panic he might genuinely being friend with that woman and your comment may made him think you were narrow minded that led him to not tell you everything that being said these type of situations are typically paradox for not knowing the other end of story the best can or believe anyone can suggest is to express yourself and how you feel to your bf if you ve had enough understanding of him you feel or realize if there was lie just don jump onto any conclusions do your best to understand what he really doing you re not ready to be married enjoy life try to find someone who is matching you who goes to vegas on vacation and doesn go to strip club what is this world coming to asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed which is good before he left told him m not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip my bf just told me yesterday that he planning on spending new year eve with the same friend this year in miami well you didnt tell him not to so he didnt guess you wanted him to realize that you want him to stop by himself that hasnt happened you should say so dont see any red flags tbh but for someone living in the west you are pretty conservative he isnt as conservative and that makes for bad match op do you really want to spend your life worried that your partner might cheat on you there are plenty of decent human beings like your partner ll assume it a good person with different lifestyle who may lead life the way you do xb you are you are going to spend hours and hours in high pressure job no one is forcing you to marry someone who lifestyle doesn work for you so why do this to yourself it only matter of time before you start getting gaslight for felling the way you feel why put your future at risk xb being hardworking person with different interests is fantastic best of luck you guys have communication problem me and my so are opposites but we got through stuff by being straight forward with each other but politely not how dare you go to strip club but d really appreciate it if you wouldn go feel disrespected this is bullshit you posted similar story few months back actually dm you to give you advice on multiple occasions what is your problem do you just wan the attention seek therapy maybe sounding too judgmental but looks like you ve had sheltered social life your s are your time to live and do crazy things going out till am partying etc this is what most people in their s do at least those who live in cities let alone in the states you don seem to do any of that and have perceived notions of what partying entails do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend place until am at night doing sheesha hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until am and vacationing in las vegas is good idea having good time doesn make you bad person also have you even talked about marriage or is this all in your head you need to realize why you re uncomfortable with all this do you not trust him which makes you imagine bad scenarios in your head with the girl scenario nothing good will come out of being too controlling it frankly quite unattractive if he does indeed like her would you want to be with him if he does indeed like you then he will automatically draw the boundary when required you need to be secure and let the chips fall how they will also try to go out more it fun keep all options open if he is playing you on reserve and not curbing his activities why don you try find better alternative he is immature for sure plus the religion card always looms ahead for argument sakes be brave confront him sound your ideas to him if he doesn love you enough then why marry someone like that 
as an nri my personal view on the serious emigration thread  www reddit com india comments ddozc as an nri my personal view on the serious here is the original thread old reddit com india comments dcquo serious emigration threat is it helpless yet as person emigrated to germany want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to india tl dr won be back as of now may be in future long version ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved infrastructure come from hyderabad and being capital city the infrastructure is shit it took more than years and massive amount to build metro and that too it over the top metro not an underground the roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads congesting it even more the city sewage is still from the nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it every year in rainy season roads and buildings are submerged in water ride bike for one hour take clean cloth and swipe on your face black layer come off that the pollution in the city auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust you are literally breathing that shit day in day out just creating better transportation does not make place livable you need to plan for the future and build something sustainable there is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle every year when visit hyd regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke please make the city more livable yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in aarey park mumbai to make way for metro we need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round it takes just strong will to inspect make every person riding vehicle to follows correct emission standards healthcare healthcare is completely different topic last year as challenge to get an mri for my cervical spondylosis problem my father asked me to get it done in osmania hospital visited for days and tried to get an appointment with neuro doctor and mri without paying bribe sadly gave up and got it done in private hospital have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital if you don puke would congratulate you imagine women carrying child for months and then delivering among other women in congested room and pathetic conditions healthcare is literally on their knees did you know years back indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them you know what can be done just good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems academics the plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to delhi govt kudos to them for bringing awareness private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds govt has no money to run schools but they make k crore statue saw some days back in up school was serving rice with salt as mid day meal are we in such fucking pathetic situation that we can not give curry dal with rice for our future generations don get me started on quality of education why can govt schools have english subject why do they have to teach only in regional language saw many govt school students under confident when they start college in germany can study for free until my pg can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if do research you know what as student pay just inr for one semester months and can take part or play as many times open the following link with chrome and translate it hsp hh sport uni hamburg de sportangprogramm htm it would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports you would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to germany played so many sports you can even imagine and that too almost free you can also take as many courses you want by paying k inr for months when you earn more then k every month for months is nothing why would leave this and come back to nothing where can get sick just by breathing that shitty air policies check out the startup culture here in berlin and munich area in india we have so many iit and lakhs of students graduating every year what is stopping the govt from creating startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh ideas they have startup fund and guess it has gone to the wind me my elder brother and younger sister all are cs students we are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in germany and branch out in india do you know why because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome every city has startup hacks meetups pitches don want to start our startup in the red tape of indian bureaucracy to be honest it a shame that in country like india we are lagging behind in startup world employment better startup policies better infrastructure better education directly leads to creating more opportunities no magic wand am in my s and working on my company there are lakhs of people like me but sadly working that shitty job in some big company just look around and see the jobs created by zomato and swiggy the cash they brought into market from consumers imagine startups like these on massive scale it would change the face of our country our economy needs to be more open and welcoming my brother used to work in east asia and came back to india and he regrets every day the daily commute traffic jams pollution is literally killing him as the first comment from mrfreeze says there are two types of people who emigrate better pay lifestyle and better work emigrated because of both you know its illegal to make me work on sat sunday if an exceptional situation arises that have to work on saturday my company has to get permission from labour office get weeks of paid holidays public holidays can travel countries just pack your bags and hop in your car los geht i get pr after working for years or years with german b certificate no shitty visa issues like in us of i can become german citizen in years can take as many sickness leaves want it my right dont do it just saying if my wife is working and expecting child she gets fourteen months of paid maternity leave as father you can also take paternity leave my whole family is covered under my health insurance covering from fever to cancer children go to awesome schools here to learn they can take music as subject or any sport and all of this is free if ever got fired get arbeitslosengeld job loss money for years guess better infrastructure better health and hospitals better care better money better air lastly guess this was written by non muslim person sorry to bring in religion as muslim myself my father urges me not to come back to india ever given the cancer that has spread in recent years have desis saying to my face anti national or paki here in germany and least expect that india stopped going to indian festival gatherings here because fear some dickhead will ask why came there and what is my intention some years back could trust my fellow indians and now lost that hope just for reference check this tweet twitter com rohini sgh status this is the cancer our country has acquired you don know the humiliation we are facing these days every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery the current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement what minority appeasement muslims situation is worse than sc st and that too without reservation why would leave all these and come back to india to suck all that shit love my country and think of it now and then but do miss it nah do miss the culture absolutely yes do want to come back and live there nope sorry edit thanks kash if for the silver edit if anyone needs help with any issues like job education just message me would be happy to help  awesome answer dude you ve put every point so precisely and there no counter to any of that but why would come back to the place d give my answer to this because am one of the few people who understand these issues because have power to solve one of these issues atleast to tiny extent because india sucking is as much fault of the knowledged staying silent as that of the stupid ruling the roost bollywood answer alert because it is my place how many ever years stay in any country wouldnt be considered as localite wouldn be able to say that this is my country you said you are and you have been in germany for years did you go there for your bachelors degree if yes was the education free for bachelors also why doesn germany have provision that parents of german immigrant citizens can also get german citizenship like canada also how is the treatment of muslims in germany cause heard the right wing is getting stronger there re indian mangoes banned it was eu wide www livemint com politics fmxwwnqzclzjvaogyhgi eu agrees to lift import ban on alphonso mangoes html there was also ban on some vegetables which remained in place same reason too much pesticide there have been similar alerts in the uae www thenational ae uae uae alert over pesticides in food from india and even the indian press has published stories timesofindia indiatimes com city hyderabad chemical concoction pesticides in veggies and fruits harm hyderabad children articleshow cms about it indians feel like people owe something to you indians take things personally like comment here service would be considered as help and refused when service is refused you know what it means fortunately service isn interpreted as help and thus not refused as much as it is in india abroad ve noticed this and that just my two cents the mentality of the people should change hyderabad doesn have gez fee germany has nice post and agree with you currently living in south east asia and always want to move to europe because of various reasons but the salaries and the taxes always make me think interesting read op am curious what is the status of racism against brown people in germany considering the fact that there been sudden inflow in refugees over the past two years also how long did it take you to get fluent in german deleted hi as someone living in germany for quite some while and familiar other parts of europe as well which countries do you see having well established or booming it tech industry at the moment in the near future also in terms of quality of life ease of integration emigration and racial attitudes and in general the culture how would you rank these countries asking because m looking at emigrating to europe as an option and would love to know your perspective ok it seems like you re having really good time in germany and your quality of life is extremely well m happy for you for that you ve risen out of the struggles of india and found some peace and breathing room in more stable place good for you mean that now is it possible for you to return to hyderabad permanently and still find way to sustain yourself and those that depend on you financially considering you re techie there is good enough market for software developers here so think that is possible if so what is stopping you from doing that the reason m asking this is because you seem like an above average and sharp person you ve also had experience abroad which lot of people do not have here with all that in mind your perspective and passion will be invaluable and the same goes for your siblings if you re this passionate about your country while staying abroad imagine what you could do for your country your city or even just your locality if you were living here so why aren you here one reason could be that you really aren financially stable enough to shift here and that ok if that not the case then the only reason left is that your passion is misplaced you are only worrying about your home because you feel like you should or because you have family living there when in reality you ve subconsciously accepted your new home in germany it either that or something else that explains why you re not in india trying to help with these problems you ve mentioned see all m hearing from your post is please make the city more livable plea coming from non resident indian who will never go through the difficulties of achieving that goal because he doesn and won live here but expects the locals to do so and inshallah we will do so but not to set up cushions for you but to furnish our own cities your post implies that us citizens are wilfully producing and promoting this black shitty air that you mention when in fact just in case you didn know we don want this air just as much as you actually we don want it more than you because we have to breathe it every day this if nothing else keeps us motivated to change that and since we are living here we can directly try to change that so you can see why rant about our shitty cities can sound hypocritical to our ears when we re trying to fix things here and someone who has just about none of dog left in the race tells us to make the city more livable it sounds very condescending like rich merchant asking the poor peasants to hurry up and stop being poor we re trying and when say you in this post mean to point to every nri that rants about the situation in india but hasn contributed to anything significant to help with it do miss it nah do miss the culture absolutely yes do want to come back and live there nope don know why wrote all this you ve said it yourself you only want the good parts without having to have worked to remove the bad parts also don know why you re worried about coming to hyderabad as muslim m not the most politically educated but even can tell you that hyderabad is possibly the safest place for an indian muslim to live in particularly hyderabadi muslim if you don believe that then either m wrong or you ve just proven how out of touch you are with your culture ppcontentrobot www reddit com user ppcontentrobot wouldn disagree with anything you are pitch perfect on what wrong in the country and wouldn blame you for choosing better quality of life wish could just raise wand and change the way things work in our country but unfortunately just can so came down here and asked the world what wrong and how we can influence change jingle bells wasn cut out for what came back if there is one thing am sure of it is of the fact that we just can keep doing this forever things around emigration will change drastically in the next decade and it will no longer be cut out for everyone wish we don have to wait till we get hit to reform change but you will always be foreigner there and never feel truly part of the country despite having citizenship not to mention the huge rise in anti immigrant sentiments in europe which although brought about by mass immigration from syria and africa will also threaten to sweep up well educated foreigners like you the sad truth is india is destined for mediocrity democracy is holding it back as it is susceptible to vote bank politics and nothing ever gets done china also has lots of different ethnic minorities although not as many as india and the reason they managed to do so well was because of an authoritarian leadership india inability to get grip with the population explosion is contributing to much of this misery we will have the same population as china by despite only having the land mass we are extremely polluted due to this population density and it is said there will be major water crisis in the future more than of our population is in agriculture this is completely unacceptable and farming should have been heavily mechanised by now and the people moved to manufacturing or something like that all this because crap politicians will keep their grip on power by gaining the votes of uneducated lower castes who can easily be convinced the smart indians will always view going abroad as the ultimate dream because they know india is beyond saving it easy to avoid dirt and walk away but it takes guts to step into the mess and clean it but can you get chai from tapari in germany from my experiences in europe and latin america prefer life in india yes it has its hassles but everything is pretty accessible here and affordable to everyone am not denying the downsides but would like to list out something that we want to overlook for greener pastures nothing to boast but find the holiday structure of govt opportunities here pretty neat and more public holidays private sector sucks yes can travel states as diverse as schengen nations just pack your bags and hop in bus or train you don even need car even to go to the remotest part no need for any language certificate to be anywhere or work anywhere free movement don know whether would want to be another citizen don know about as many but its pretty neat here too yup no paternity leave here exists here too children can play with other children and go to good schools as well might not be as extensive as there in curriculum yes think you pay much more tax too for social security but way def positive not great at infrastructure but hospital and care are def good in my state the only place felt like settling in was urban brazil felt like dev version of india with the most diverse and welcoming people have ever met very interesting response its your choice as to where you want to stay hyderabad versus germany but want to ask what are the laws about spitting and littering in germany did you educate your family and friends in hyderabad about them can you have religious functions in germany shouting slogans in the street can mosque have loudspeakers blaring azaan times day can you set up slaughterhouse on eid and slaughter goats in the name of religion in germany can you stand and say am an immigrant and muslim in germany did you know that the pollution you are complaing about comes from vehicles and people attempt to pay bribes to get puc certificates try that in germany too can you get fake degrees in germany like in hyderabad can you come out after friday prayers and pelt stones there can you tamper with your electric meter have lived in hyderabad and several cities in india yes things are not hunky dory and perhaps lots of things can improve some of us are trying to improve but you chose to leave and go away to germany and that fine if you don want to return to india in to years please don just don lecture us about how much germany is better keep in mind that if the far right takes power in germany you ll be the first one demanding for ticket on the flight back to hyderabad all of these luxurious things you mentioned are available in germany because of under population and plentiful resources jobs that is how things were in most developed countries us is case in point generation ago once the population increases and competition for jobs intensifies things will swing to the other extreme and quickly remember the country you are boasting about has very bloody history of discrimination and not too long ago either itna nafrat toh yaha post kyyu karte ho india should stop leaning into nris as victims indians living in india are victims farmers students graduates patients average earning consumers when will we stop catering towards whats happening to brown looking people in america as an indian living in india don fucking care if you are fucked in usa dhobi ka kutta na ghar ka na ghat ka your sorry ass will ignore this statement as well so fuck you and your anti india minds just to fill your purpose indians must and should never help you our indian health care is fucked and has gone way down because indian born doctors in us study from india and performs rectal exam of some white crack head hillbilly just because his skin is white and beautiful he never will chose to do the same for indian sewer cleaner the color makes huge difference hence the health care is worst and people in india die everyday unlike america cuz indians are always there to cure white people in exchange of dollars fuck your immigration issues d rather have an hardworking illlegal bangladeshi or pakistani in india than discussing or worring about your sorry ass in usa or germany for nothing 
are indians just cheap commodity to the world www reddit com india comments dncdw are indians just a cheap commodity to the world whilst it nice to see india represented nicely in the world stage against the tidal wave of memes about us being gang rapists street shitters curry eaters and tribalistic cavemen can go on and on big you get the picture feel people look at indians as commodity instead of as people this is bit of rant but ll elaborate for example before the last cricket world cup reddit cricket was awash with few footballers and athletes from different sports taking selfies with indian shirts saying support team india cricket was awash with fawning indian fans granted know most will be young fans but something didn sit right with me its clear that these stars dont even know what cricket is let alone there is wc going on it was clearly just pr strategy the similar thing was done by alot of companies when it comes to bollywood just found it soooooo patronizing and condescending they know indians would eat that shit straight out of their hands the know quality doesnt mean anything but quantity goes along way india has very fad based culture so consumerism of merchandise is easy for international companies dont blame the companies its basic marketing just wish indians would be self aware and appreciate that these people dont give shit about indians except our wallets and want us eating out of their hands we make ourselves look desperate and pathetic  can partly agree mean look at those youtube channels reacting to bollywood and our guys go crazy doubt they even care but keeping shifting for views and likes it same with lot huge population uncensored internet and those companies will mine is the best why do you think indians are different from the rest of the world do you think anyone else isnt viewed as commodity why is there surge of chinese people in hollywood why do you think they name drop place an indian hindi word in hollywood nowadays why do you think disney has some cringey social justice quips in their movies while at the same time the chinese movie posters remove black people you think nba gives shits about anything other than their bottomline look at how they placed gag order on their players and staff about hongkong but no such thing for topics regarding america being woke in usa gets them money and not being woke regarding china gets them money every person of every nationality is commodity to these corporations celebrities politicians in fact compared to the west india doesnt have fad based culture at all read your post times still couldn understand what you are trying to say hopefully someone gets you lot of indians are new to high usage of internet people will smarten up with time for the meme part people laugh all long on memes made on americans that they are fat dumb clueless ignorant people but are they really people make memes that britishers are tea drinking pompous arrogant fucks but are they really people make memes that french are dumbasses but are they really each of these countries have noble laureates and some of the most intelligent people in the entire world belong to these countries so memes are basically way to make fun you can make fun of literally anything by seeing subset of population how much you get affected by that is up to you don think high achieving professor at big university in us gives two flying fucks about what americans are portrayed as in world he is busy with his work busy raho as for brands and all am sorry to say but can you please take look at some influencers and young teenage celebrities in us or uk you will find some of the most pompous dumbest idiots that you may have ever seen and after seeing their brand endorsing you would wish that aliens finish us off with laser beam and yet people love them especially young teens and high school going kids who believe they are the next love child of einstein and brad pit if they become popular in their school so yeah we aren much different lol admit it youngsters throughout the world aka generation are royal idiots and that is normal brands have been exploiting that mentality for centuries if there is one thing that is cheap and make indians commodity it is cheap labor and absence of enforcement of labor laws that makes indians cheap cheap outsourced low quality labor modern day it industry why do you think youtubers farm for likes and subscribers by talking over and reacting to shit like can believe this is india or indian cinema trailer when they would never even think about visiting india nor watch the entire movie india is heaven for the rich and hellhole for the poor people here are not shitting on india just for the sake of shitting the young person who lives in india works to contribute towards the gdp and pays third of its salary in tax gets screwed day in and day out its daily struggle for an honest citizen to get essentials like continuous power supply running water decent public transport and roads that the reason he is frustrated and will be until the government and the system stops being bitch of the rich and powerful to anyone who gives me the india shining gyan tell them to come live here for just months in polluted city travel in shitload of traffic and pollution to mediocre job and come back to sleep in by room without fan because the power is out once you have lived that life then tell me that you are proud of india don base your worldview on internet comments yeah well we are learning and soon we ll be more selective aware and deadass badasses if the countries wants to make fun of the good stuff that we have like the food diversity culture and music don care if they raise finger on the bad stuff like women safety hygiene corruption etc then we should do something and should try to make it better was interested with your initial statement but then below the title you explain something different xb your title implies that the low income of indians allow the other countries to see them as an inexpensive workhorse for example in it or manufacturing think partially this is true xb your content says that people are manipulating indians into buying useless products by using obvious marketing think that is this might also be true in which case it might be better to say the world is shamelessly selling their crap to indians dont form your worldview based on reddit and the internet there are indians generally millennials around the world who mesh well within the local communities form life long friendships with people from different backgrounds anyone who grew up in multicultural environment will attest to that yep we are easy to fool have you seen those foreign youtube channels monetising reacting to stupid videos of bollywood kollywood embarrassing self flagellation max yes op you and the rest of the educated gentlefolk india are the iklauta enlightened ones free from influence of all marketing campaigns able to see through the curtain of big corporations and their pr campaigns looking down in disgust upon the plebeian masses that are blind to the evils of advertising so what if some people are happy to be marks for things they are fanatic about so consumerism of merchandise is easy for international companies because we indians are good for nothing we don have the knowledge to invent or create anything in our lives we have been taught to copy from others what the west do we must do it too has always been indian mantra since independence or much before that mahatma gandhi saw that and tried to stop this westernized copying mechanism and tried to make us self reliant and creative in his s of speeches he didn just talked about freedom from british he tried to teach us how to never rely on the west and their style thus he made indians to burn the western clothes and made charkha as symbol to start with but we never paid any heed to it we always let western culture influence us and in years we and our entire generations have become an complete white cock sucking dependents what we should have been proud of we slowly rejected it and always looked at the west if indians were really proud of themselves mcdonalds or pizza hut wouldn have dared to have maximum franchise here slowly cuz we would have already beaten them had we promoted ourselves cuz we look at our food and culture as cheap vadapav chole bhature etc as poor culture food we always made up our mind that rich people consumes pizzas and pastas but little did we know that pizza was italian coal miner no option food and pastas were nothing but italian grannies rolling flour into noodles and fry it in oil and garlic but we made it look like this is what we will eat when we will become rich but if poor we will eat dal roti this is the mindset indians carry even today and ll tell these mcdonald eating morons it is made cheaper than vadapav but you pay money on mcd only on it brand name same with other american franchise as well yes indians are that stupid worldwide and are easy to fool with first world brand names ambani will wear nothing but italian made fabric cuz that will show his richness amongst indians pathetic poor cuz we indians believe that italian leather is world famous lol either that or you can look at us foreign companies and stars pandering to us because we are an increasingly bigger economy for them it happens to china and slowly it happening to us mean congratulations on discovering capitalism independently guess what wrong with curry eaters that the tastiest way to enjoy food with this is really narcissistic view of us fuck any one who has problem with curry curry is good

guys am disappointed in the way we exploit the poor people of india  www reddit com india comments ebrc guys i am disappointed in the way we exploit the we see poor people everywhere in this country sometimes right in front of some extremely rich and posh areas we see beggars trying to get meal day in front of the same malls where we throw away half of the expensive mall food we eat we move to countryside same case thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them government schools that barely educate them social welfare policies that are worth billions that won even cover their most basic of the needs huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as home billions in medicine that won even help curing most common ailments enormous quantities of ration that isn even the fraction of what is needed all of that because they are born in the wrong place to the wrong families in the wrong castes etc it just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done the resources that could be utilized properly am extremely disheartened watching all this guys very very disappointed of such inefficiency in exploitation mean what the hell are we thinking wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement like we could use it to make sport where we throw it into river or something or just put all that on the ground and dance on it maximizing enjoyment factor all that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for fist full of food but then kill them anyway instead of wasting all this electricity and technology to apparently elevate these people you know what we can do giant machines machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass we hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts think about it we can use this butt currency to improve our economy place bets in the death matches etc our country is going to be trillion dollar economy in few months imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that we we could be like self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto mean seriously think about this it is much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now just my two cents join me in supporting for humane and prosperous india lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy by locking up the poor only poor illiterates count  apparently of the population is below poverty line that is they live by dollar day lot of time we don see them because we live in bubble your security guards and waiters mostly come from bihar and ne and there are much lesser jobs our countrymen do its the middle class that is getting the in india was that an attempt at mocking the underprivileged lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy by locking up the poor only poor illiterates count our country is going to be trillion dollar economy in few months wrong fact just get one thing straight it doesn matter however targeted programmes you run there is only one way to remove poverty that is is rapid economic growth rising tide lifts all boats you may not want it but the country needs more mukesh ambani so that they can employ millions and thus there is some hope for some people just see chinese example they didn care about people opinions they picked them from villages provided them jobs housing medical and thus created chain of people coming out of abject poverty though am well aware this can be implemented in india deleted hi so feel the same way you can really change generations of class divide however change yourself treat everyone with respect say thank you and sorry to watchmen chefs and walters and try not to disturb them too much just be kind and understanding to all try not to dress too fancy all the time remember the zeros on the left side of your net worth matter alot but after while the zeros on the right and side matter less try to live humble life never waste food or try to do so if possible try to use public transport and just be nice person who doesn show off his or her money or parents money just don give money in charity but time also by volunteering for cause you think you are good at you don know how many lives you cand drastically improve indirectly get confused with the term poor people offlate at least majority of those who qualify under the poor people category in cities don really fall under this group as they earn really well but in unaccountable ways aka without any taxation how they spend their money is different matter though most of these poor people earn hand full in cities or don earn because they are lazy and not because of lack of opportunities feel every time get exploited by these poor people rather than exploiting them it starts with almost everyone who fall into this bpl category and they will try to extract as much as possible from you or cheat you or want to get away with half baked work take your maid auto driver road sweeper vegetable seller construction worker etc etc etc just this evening am fooled with poor quality apples in spite of paying the amount he asked for it ps am specifically referring to these fake poor people in cities and not the real poor mostly outside big cities towns who struggle to meet ends inspite of hard work 
 general what is your opinion about the iits do you think they re worth it what should be done to fix the obviously flawed institutions and their admission process  www reddit com india comments eaink general what is your opinion about the iits do some of you may have come across one of my previous posts in this subreddit which can be found here www reddit com india comments esqaz im jee aspirant is there any chance i can crack utm medium android app utm source share if you re looking for the full story basic information is that ve been preparing for jee mains exam but some problems have hindered my preparation and plan while preparing couldn ignore how flawed these institutions are there barely any research done barely any breakthroughs in science lack of innovation and lot of it can be attributed to how these institutions take in students the admission process is biased towards upper middle class and the rich those who can afford the ridiculously expensive coaching institutions the coaching culture is demon in its own way and deserves thread on its own but ll keep it as straight and simple as can the admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to specific type of question it doesn require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it could go on and on about how the system is flawed how they should introduce western ways to take in students which both supports extra curricular activities overall creativity communication and sports in conclusion don think they re worth years of life the students have to sacrifice in order to get these institutions the pressure and lack of social interaction  fuck iit we don need any more quora users around us but on serious note iits are one of the few options of becoming lpm earner in years and can help lower middle class person jump to upper middle class if you feel you aren cut out for iit thats okay there isn a need to discredit that institution with made up stories cracking jee and getting admission into an iit has become more oriented around getting that celebrity status you ll already know if an iit is living in radius of km or three in laws relations have seen indian parents worshipping iitian like literally putting them on pedestal prodigy an example to your spoiled brat it more because of the hype of iits remember vividly when was in th and one of my friends asked me will you go for iit at that time have no idea about even it existence it was like some new fad everyone talking about won say jee is biased though but the competition has given to varieties of problems depression anxiety anti social living has become the pre requisites for an iitian we have to tackle this somehow before it too late to be dealt with look get all the lack of research and creativity and all that stuff but the fact of the matter is that an iitian tag is something that almost guarantees better professional and social life an institute is much more than its admission process the access to resources alumni network placecom networks seniors etc is something that will give you huge advantage all your life they are worth what have seen so far but that because their curriculum is designed that way nothing extraordinary when compared to us education system but stands out in our indian educational process but what strongly dislike in them the most is their attitude at workplaces they behave like beyond genius and form their own group and cult and won let anyone else mingle they are snobbish and highly irritating group that by far my experience so far could be wrong and their could be exceptions yes if you wanna join lpm club asap the admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to specific type of question it doesn require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it actually this is not true the reason the exam is difficult is actually because you have to think in an innovative way about the problem could go on and on about how the system is flawed how they should introduce western ways to take in students which both supports extra curricular activities overall creativity communication and sports iits have the best infrastructure in india so doubt the situation is as bad as you re saying it is in conclusion don think they re worth years of life the students have to sacrifice in order to get these institutions maybe not years but they are definitely worth sacrificing years which most people do as someone studying in tier college now iits are miles ahead of us imo you should definitely try your hardest to crack the exam the admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to specific type of question it doesn require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it loled so hard at this these papers are no joke and do require lot of practice and deep thinking to be able to crack it years ago one of my teachers in fiitjee said that if your hardwork must compensate for the deficiency in iq people some require hours some may require hours and some may require the most amusing part of this paper is that you seem to be confident that am well prepared and when you see the paper it on an entirely new fucking pattern with new types of question at that point you must dynamically adjust yourself and years of prepartion else you are screwed don think they re worth years of life the students have to sacrifice in order to get these institutions the pressure and lack of social interaction you haven seen anything am in my final year from non iit govt college even though simply cannot be anymore thankful to the govt for the facilities provided for basically peanuts screwing up jee is the biggest regret of mine till date went to iit fests did my internship from iit and believe me they are worth your perseverance and dedication you put in for years am placed person got package of lpa and cannot be any happier about it but my people who never put as much effort as me got double the package of mine just because they are from iit particularly iit it a tag worth fighting for at least you won regret that you didn give it shot the amount of shit thrown at iits is unreal they are the best institutions in the country for reason for all the complaints about shitty admission exam it actually not shitty it relies less on memory power than any other entrance exam in india can guarantee you that an average iitian is better than an average student from other institutions yes the iitian ego is real but that doesn taint the fact that the institutions are undoubtedly the best in india right now regarding the complaints about research you should keep in mind that the mtechs or phds in iits are not the ones who did undergrad in iits who passed that admission test rather they are undergrads in other non iit colleges to gauge how iitian research is you have to go through the research progress of foreign universities whatever tier you pick iitians are ubiquitous you can even find profs there who did their undergrad in iits so your complaint about research should really be targeted at how bad the undergrad studies in non iits are having said that iits have their own faults they are still not ideal nevertheless they are the best india had has and will have 
do people get socially personally alienated because they re not interested scared of pets  www reddit com india comments dql do people get socially personally alienated over the past few months and over the course of the last couple of years have noticed that an not having an overwhelming affection for dogs cats and all assorted pets is rather significant factor in maintaining relations with friends and family dealbreakers when it comes to dating and possibly relations too m mother father of doggos if there a doggo in your pic m dating you and stealing that good boi the evergreen classic doggos over humans any day if my cat likes you only then you have my approval the deluge of appreciation tweets posts on instagram facebook now the rise in posts in this very sub over the past week and many many more dating apps have women and men displaying overwhelming affection for their pets ve personally been unmatched and digitally broken contact with on couple of occasions because straight up admitted that m not too keen about pets specifically dogs that m kinda scared of dogs in general due to childhood mishap with pet dog is whole other issue altogether growing up ve managed to control my fear worry and while don exactly start screaming when in close proximity to dog do look visibly panicked m not exaggerating when say potential marriage alliance was completely nipped in the bud because of the fact that she had tattoo of her pet dog and clearly admitted that m not fan of having pet pets in the future my entire existence as human being and all my joys and sorrows education academics work experience sporting and personal achievements were instantly invalidated in flash because of this viewpoint while clearly and obviously do not have an issue with folks having pets at their homes and the visible rise of pet friendly public spaces cafes restaurants any attempts at trying to meet at non pet presence places is met with lot of derision and straight up hostility understand that folks with pets treat them as nothing short of family members but their decision to stay away from actual human beings avoid and have low opinion of those who are averse to pets is rather confusing and if may admit to it bit hurtful as well ve missed out on couple of social personal relations because of this and really do think it rankles am only one being overtly sensitive to this situation or is this an actual thing  along with being foodie wanderlust sapiosexual etc love of pets has been forced trend of sorts this sub too caught on that trend lately getting out of marriage is understandable if they strongly want pet and you are totally against it however alienating people just because they don like pets is taking things to the extreme think if you are nice person in general people will like you if someone makes massive deal out of you not liking animals you re better off without them mean avoiding or ostracising people over something they like interests like animals movies etc don like is very shallow and childish way to behave knew person who hated pets or any animals and lot of people disliked her but not for her hating animals she was just an asshole in general regarding the marriage alliance why would she want to be with someone who doesn want the same things in life for her her pet dog was probably more important than some random person obviously she gonna reject the person who has clearly told her that he doesn want pets many animal lovers won spare change to poor kid won buy him meal but would spend lakhs on their dogs petting an animal is ok but when you equate dog life with human life don want to do anything with you these fucking assholes would feed the stray dogs inside the building complex those stray dogs kept coming inside and started barking at soceity members if you re feeding dog do it outside couple of months ago couple of stray dogs killed kid and these fucking assholes had the gall to put blame on him saying that dogs are loyal they won harm you fuck that shit they won take new stray dogs nor their ngos will do that but won let the officials kill them wtf had to physically fight off these stray dogs when was kid with bat haven you heard of karen who live with their cats when they re old as they couldn find someone who could love them yeah have seen couple of those in mumbai if you want to maintain your sanity d advise you to stay away from them couples in the west divorce over pets let these cunts die with their catshit just stay away from them and let them do what they want edit this is mostly for cats and dogs m fine with rabbits parrots birds etc had parrot as pet share the same feeling infact once had heated argument about it am still not sure about the ethical issue here so rich lady with fancy dog won spare single penny for the hungry kid outside her car window in traffic light signal have seen people spending over k on their dogs monthly and not single penny for charity don understand this behaviour the social capital of human is anyday greater than dogs believe may be wrong here though do you live in india because haven came across such hardcore dog or cat lovers here would say animal hierarchy in our country goes like this cow other domestic animals like buffalo dogs lion elephant tiger never met cat lover in my entire life deleted its just class divide mechanism used by the upper class to differentiate them with the middle class and lower class you have got valid point but think overcoming your fear is also one way you can do it try getting along with pups first whatever you choose later will be your own but giving in fear won do any good dogs and cats are hella pure and yeah if you aren good with animals ll lose little trust in you shouldn really stop anyone from being your friend or getting into relationship but yeah get yourself to blue cross and try to work with few animals 
unpopular opinion virat kohli is an overrated personality www reddit com india comments bgxiv unpopular opinion virat kohli is an overrated not great cricket fan but watch major tournaments have noticed many times that virat is famous yet hot headed sportsperson he has big fan following so he must play it cool and try not to make an angry face or super celebrating even something small dhoni is cool he plays it cool idk why but just don like virat for his this behaviour also don know the truth about what he screams or cries in an ongoing match but it seems more like some abusive word or an insult for opposing team players he is great sportsman but he should realise the fact that he is role model for young and aspiring players  don think anyone rates him for his personality he is brilliant cricketer with the typical mainstream punjabi delhi attitude if it was not for his cricketing talent and hardwork he would ve been another sreensanth when did this become unpopular it a free country he is as free to be himself as you are to dislike him why devote so much time to thinking about people who have no influence on your life whatsoever have gone from being hater to absolutely adoring him no homo he earned all the respect through unbelievable consistency performing everywhere in the world and conquering all challenges posed to him kohli is probably not as gifted as sachin but he more than makes up for that through elite level of fitness that allows him to run doubles after scoring hundred at same speed when he came on the crease he plays cricket for india and is bloody good at it that all that matters if you want to hear his side of the story then watch nat geo masterclass episode on him edit no doubt he bit of an asshole he a sports person and every sports person has their own style you can see that in different sports as well see ronaldo djokovic they have so much anger on the field because that helps them so what wrong he not the most talented cricketer like rohit sharma but he the best cricketer in the world right now due to his hard work and determination and dedication to fitness met virat once off the field he a really kind person and gentleman don care about his personality he a great player rohit sharma is gifted and telented batsman however virat kohli is hardworking batsman and if history has proven one thing that is hardwork beats talents if you see earlier records under nineteenth even couple of years after compare rohit sharma and virat kohli you will find that sharma was little ahead and cricket came naturally to him however virat kohli is diciplined hardworker and he did not had butter chicken in last years heard in an interview compare love handles of rohit sharma nothing against rohit sharma scoring in an international is nothing sort of miracle but virat kohli is different he has picked his sacrifices he is impatience but compensate with perseverance he is constantly trying improve not only his game but also in other life aspects whenever he is on buses he make sure that he reads self improvement book am not fan of virat kohli but am fan of his dicipline and regime aggression is absolutely necessary in competitive sports cricket in particular some manifest that aggression through shrewd tactics some do it in body language and some really talented ones do both whats up with everyone hating his aggression on the field just because dhoni was cool not everyone can be like him if you are expecting everyone to be nice to everyone then you must living in an another dimension don understand the folks here first you guys cry about the log kya kahenge attitude of parents and when someone doesn give damn about it you turn back and say hooo you re role model act like it why tf should he care what people kids think about him sexy cricketer though his batting is poetry in motion doesn hurt that the helmet means don have to look at his face he has matured after marriage might be bit cocky but sportsmen ka chalta hai youtu be gc sptxnxrs watch this www youtube com watch gc sptxnxrs feature youtu be www youtube com watch gc sptxnxrs feature youtu be what rahul dravid is saying about him staying authentic people ask me why didn behave like virat when played for india would have been inauthentic to myself had gotten tattoos and behaved like virat sometimes before an australia series virat says the most outrageous things read it in the newspaper and cringe but then feel that he wants that tough contest and wants that lip on the field because it gets the best out of him you can blame him because it works so very well for him but that may not be everyone cup of tea ajinkya rahane for example is very different what worries me is that lot of young kids tend to copy virat without realising that they are not being authentic to who they really are guys there is term called sportsmanship it means playing competitively and yet respecting the game and the opponent players you just cant go bad mouthing and showing frustation every time you get chance thatbis just bad faith first kohli seemed to do this coz of his immense passion these days it seems like he just fcuking hates his opponents no matter how good you are when you play at the level he is you habe the resposibility of maintaining decorum see tennis for reference m glad others in this world who care about cricket see kohli abuse filled aggression as passion for the game no doubt he one of the best in the world out there but if the same abuse that he spews on field if done on the street he could face criminal charges for abusive behaviour sadly commentators misinterpret as the passion so does the media and budding cricketers and youth use the same in their field of work too deleted slightly late to the party but anywho vk is definitely not overrated over the years he has changed from brash immature gaali spewing young boy to calmer more mature man this was evident by the way he has carried himself in the public eye most remarkably when he defended his then girlfriend and now wife anushka sharma when she was getting trolled by his supporters it is important to note that he started his career at an early age and since then he has been under scrutiny all of us were dumb as teenagers just that our antics were not scrutinized by the media if anything virat kohli should be role model for all young boys he lost his father when he was barely in his teens went to play match while grieving his death led his team to victory made the team became the best damn player that india has seen in long time and is now leading the team to victory in the cwc that too without any connections or influence purely on the basis of his talent and hard work he also seems to be popular with his team and has their respect and support he is supportive husband who is not afraid to show his love for his wife and to stand up for her his aggression is part of his game and it is what makes him him don think that a valid reason to hate on him given that the aggression has never transformed into anger issues giving way to physical violence he is shining example of how your talent and hard work can take you to dizzying heights as far as pure skill and temperament goes he is in his own league he is better than sachin don think he overrated he deserves to run his mouth and act like douche all he wants if he can back it up you don have to love his personality just his cricket makes it all the more fun and satisfying to watch him be cocky and then get outplayed and humbled by the other team every once in while loved old virat exactly for his hot headed behavior in this country woth all our bullshit like repect elder respect the tradition act mature bla bla bla he was such nice change he used to have fuck you have skills back up my attitude mentality which was so fucking inspirational india needed young energy like him which showed that skill and hard work are the most important not sucking to people above you now he has matured though which is also good in healthy society hard working successful people should be celebrated and respected virat is beast when it comes to hardwork he is great player which is what matters m big big kohli fan he a run machine probably the best white ball batsman ever never ever seen someone so consistent as him the only thing that keeps him going is his ferocious intensity on field he might be nightmare for opposition but off the field he does come across as very cool guy have seen almost all of his interviews and found none where he acted as dick everyone has their own strengths that gets the best of out them dhoni calmness maybe but for virat it his agression and intensity as harsha bhogle said it you take intensity out of kohli there no kohli left btw dhoni isn cool calm raina had pointed it out during one interview that dhoni frequently gives stick which is not wrong abused manish on camera again nothing wrong and latest where he came on field to confront the umpire for the no ball call realized it long time ago before he was crowned legendary status you woke up pretty late have never seen biggest snob in the sports before kohli overrated no motherfucker he not you ll understand when you start watching cricket don know why indian fans are so obsessed with behaviour cousin who lives in australia told me how many fans he has there ffs understand the sport you ll know he already legend and he better than dhoni idk why dhoni has more fans than sachin and dravid dhoni can perform outside india he overrated yeah know this comment will be downvoted to oblivion no shit people are generally pretty obnoxious when it comes to hero worship and the cricket fans take it to the next level support this opinion he is absolutely loved by media no questions are asked about his captaincy decisions etc just let off he is role model for young and aspiring players assholes will always be assholes why not be good cricketer while you re at it hate

people of india let talk about narcissistic personality disorder and abusive relationships have put my experience here would like know other people experiences and how things went and how they recovered  www reddit com india comments cotkm people of rindia lets talk about narcissistic  few months back had posted question on india to seek people opinions on their experience with broken engagement if they had any in the post had mentioned my experiences of what happened in vague putting things in perspective my engagement ended simply because shared my past struggles and future career ambitions with my to be wife fiancée struggles were in general related to sports injury past relationship career decisions my sole motivation to let her know about few from past was first that was being honest and wanted my to be to know me in and out before marriage practically speaking if we can discuss our weaknesses struggles insecurities with our so then there is definitely something wrong with the relationship anyway on my previous post many people had replied most said that had dodged bullet while few held me responsible for whatever happened now coming to present do have my closure moved on to better things in life but the days and months post the breaking of engagement were really really horrible nightmare that wish no one should go through what realized after almost months that went through was narcissistic abuse all the time was suffering thinking that something is wrong with me and am responsible for all the events but it was the girl my fiancée she was covert narcissist they are the worst kind of human to ever stay in this world this inference is not by me but by psychologists almost months after the ending of engagement one day when was simply browsing over the internet about abusive relationship word popped up narcissism it just struck me like big slap on my face the realisation came that what went through were ditto match to what someone endures in narcissistic relationship brief account of what happened pre and post engagement it was simple case of arranged indian marriage girl family were too keen for marriage initially girl presented her as very charming and was very acceptable with our match only issue with her was to take things slowly asked her why she is marrying me she said am honest mature etc etc and have everything she wants in prospective partner also she wants to continue job can cook want to go office party and booze support her parents financially etc was cool with everything will even support your parents since now they are my parent too but suddenly after weeks slowly things changed she slowly started avoiding any communication started telling lies blatant manipulation showed controlling behaviour became very passive aggressive she would just give silent treatment out of nowhere we were supposed to go together from our work city to our home town get engaged next day and be back during the whole journey hrs one side she just did not talked to me just acted as if have committed some crime when asked what wrong she said everything is fine am just over reacting she acted totally normal in front of other in the end knew something is wrong asked parents from both side to meet to sort our issue here is what she said or did she said worry lot take too much tension am mamma boy work in govt sector but she want someone in it am years older than her and wants someone of her age am immature am not fun am nerd etc etc she used my past experiences to spin it around as real issues she blamed me of still having affair with my ex and blamed me of having physical relationship in past she said have very low confidence her father questioned my confidence and how am able to do job with responsibility her mother told that her daughter will love me after marriage if make her feel safe in the end she compared me to karela very bitter vegetable which mostly no one likes and said how can karela be compared to mango she put statement as her wa dp pointing towards me why so mean coz thought if look unapproachable then you will not approach me how realised she was narcissist she herself has said she feels no emotions her twins bio clearly mentions her as narcissistic she was master manipulator pathological liar caught herself many number of times had extreme abusive personality blamed my mother for scolding her but my mother never did the classic stages of any narc relationship was there in my case too initial charm then slow manipulation torture for no reason at all and then final discard in which everything is blamed on you have undergone therapy after wards with couple of psychologist and psychiatrist all of them pointed to issues with her mental state nothing was wrong with me expect she had damaged me till the brinks of destruction she said in the beginning that she has temper issues people perceive her as having excessive attitude she was extremely jealous of people she never said anything good about her friends she made sure don meet any one of her friend or colleague she never shared anything deep about her although she asked everything from me when asked she would immediately change topics there were many mind fukkary with her anyway have moved on the scars will always haunt me but the whole experience has actually changed me for the better as for me know am pretty chill guy quiet fun to be with actually real traveller achieved lot in my life and also works as gazetted officer with goi she works as some associate in some american bank in biryani city after her went on dating spree met almost girls many of them said one thing for sure have very good heart and need to preserve it would like to know if anyone had experienced narcissism npd first hand what their experiences are for all it is proper mental disorder and people having npd are the epitome of soul destroying t tldr first hand experience about extreme abusive relationship in which the perpetrator was covert narcissistic person  hear all these stories and look at my wife and just realize how fortunate am was best friends with people who had distorted view about reality since lived in hostel same as them it was impossible to steer off their radar those were the kind of people who never understood my own past struggles abusive childhood non existent friends failed friendships and it was to the point that couldn share anything without them interrupting and starting their own story there were lot of instances where felt like why am even in their company know it not like being in companionship with but you know where friendship is given importance in this era used to feel that they are not the kind of people should be friends with their personalities started to grow on me for them being an introvert was disease never got time for myself had stopped interacting with others plus their constant complaining was big headache they considered that the world works according to their mindset and would still complain about how other people are idiots never once saw them praising someone for their personality it was either looks or marks love learning new languages reading philosophical texts debating about random af shit they would stop me from expressing my thoughts about any topic felt at conflict lot of times it wasn easy to get out of their company what ate where went what did were monitored it was strange getting calls from them and not from my own parents staying in their company made impossible for me to even observe that m becoming emotionally weaker day by day my physical health was going down and the fact that they started blaming me about my anger issues when in reality was only exhibiting anger where normal person would do friends should help you grow help you get out of bad phase you reciprocate it too it is not one way street where helped them in their crisis and couldn feel satisfied from their help my mind was chaotic around them one year of their fuckery was enough initial charm slow manipulation yada yada was all there had to fake fight to get out of their company felt terrible after leaving them felt like was the bad person for breaking their group later on they got back together thought that did something really bad to them went for counseling started to make new friends kept my distance from the new friends learnt about narc behavior online don remember crying that much over an online article every single thing written there was spot on the fact that outsiders perceived them likable on the basis of how they acted outside op did you start copying her behavior or maybe start legitimizing her actions as normal without considering that in real world it toxic as hell because did that kitna time laga ye sab likhne mei tez landa honestly were lucky imagine having to live with person like that gosh should thank your lucky stars its difficult to see that some people in comment section dont even acknowledge that npd maybe problem and it not their fault maybe they have not come in contact with someone having narcissistic personality my very own brother has this type of personality have seen some bad shit in my childhood and growing up with him no one is spared my friend agree with every point of yours she was narcissist maybe if you would have spent more time with her she would turn out to be sociopath you never know but narcissist people do exist and they hurt people around them and they are master manipulators you just have to realize that its not your fault work in govt sector but she want someone in it what the fuck lmao how and why is this preferance deleted not denying that she was narcissist npd should probably be the national mental illness of india but fail to understand what kind of relationship were you trying to build with stranger because your parents and her parents put their stamp of approval on it that it how do you expect that to work if not npd your personalities could be completely opposite this is the problem with the culture of arranged marriage narcissistic elders arranging and facilitating relationship for their narcissistic children don mean you in my view you re wrong in expecting ready made relationship with stranger because your parents said so relatable it was years for me got outvery painfully life went in downward spiral after the break up years on could bring myself to let anybody in again only one thing want to say is some people do like karela foundthemobileuser thank you for taking the time to write this so wanted to know that if these people are hard to identify straight away is there feasible defense mechanism would taking your time before forming your opinion on people work and to always be cautious to not trust some fully until you know them very very well op this was brave move from you opening up about this in indian subreddit mental health and personality disorders are not given importance in our country there is lot of taboo around the concept of taking therapy can never understand as to why people think it is ok to be dysfunctional and cause harm to others and at the same time feel the need to laugh at those who try to better themselves by seeking help this is probably gonna get buried but anyway think my mom might be narcissistic anytime would get ill she would get very frustrated felt like she was annoyed at how much more work it would take for her she would get very angry and disappointed at me if ever got less than marks because that meant my cousin might get rank in that crappy school she just constantly talks about how much work we kids are on her how much work she has to do for us arranging birthdays was big chore for her and she would remind us anytime she did something for me about how much of favor it was she wouldn care about anything do other than my marks she would arbitrarily not let me buy cheap stuff and would say earn your own money she used to hit me lot when was younger when dad would ask why am crying she would tell completely downplayed version of her side she would just say don cry like girl look how stupid you look while crying she constantly tells about how good she is at managing her work home chores she would tell almost everytime someone would recognize her when she went outside she would tell how all those people in town are her enemies cuz they are jealous of her our family money she would use me in her fights with dad saying if you talk to him ll go jump in the well whenever she is wrong she would tell straight up lies and blame others for her mistakes and never budge got very heavily depressed and my studies went to hell she would daily remind me how useless am how much better other kids are doing that kind of made my condition worse and worse she used to say me and you should both drink posion because you are useless anyway started making jokes like watchout might have put something in your juice was overweight and started intermittent fasting and was losing kgs month told her about my weight loss which was big mistake thinking back on it she started saying you ll get weak and thin she started mixing butter in my food and forced me to eat tonic pills which would cause hunger she wouldnt leave until ate them and then wait for minute or so more so would be forced to swallow them thankfully she forgot about that in days am still recovering from it been suicidal depressed have ptsd while still living almost on her mercy sorry for the word salad deleted well written op found about narcissist personality disorder the same way after ended relationship my ex narc lack of empathy and sense of entitlement was astonishing pulled the plug first time she had rage fearing mental imbalance and later realized almost all of her qualities matched what internet talks about npd the stare subtle putdowns princess syndrome unapologetic moving relationship very fast blatant lies to the point of joke and the charming personality initially you dodged major bullet arey bc bolna tha na aam nahi watermelon pasand hai mujhe aam to chuse hue nikle you should never reveal weakness and vulnerability in front of girls they are natural manipulators and know exactly how to hurt you in any case it seems like she didn wanted to get married to you and was forced by her family 
chandrayaan moon landing www reddit com india comments dffgv chandrayaan moon landing isro chandrayaan mission is significant technological event that has kept space watchers in india and across the

the lunar rover the landing module comprising the lander and rover has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight edit th september communications with the landing module were lost while it was around km from the surface failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive but are inevitable and one could argue essential for eventual success to space enthusiasts keep the chins up the orbiter lives and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full edit ii th september the chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface isro confirms that thermal image of the lander has been taken the chandrayaan team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using

did you guys hear the angry journalist barking where is the chairman why is he not facing the press as if he has fled away after scam such scumbag ok so some retards are already out with wastage of public resources in country of poverty rhetoric here the thing total mission cost was cr minuscule portion of total budget india doesn actually spend that much money on the space program bjp spent cr on their election campaign india space program actually helps in alleviating poverty by creating jobs by helping farmers and fishermen by tracking weather activities by educating poor people through edusat etc it is so painful to watch the isro chairman crying no matter what is the outcome will stand by with isro and will fight internet battles on their behalf fuck anyone who thinks isro is not competent enough or perhaps we ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers and we ve barely begun and that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us quote form interstellar removed what makes it all the more hard to swallow is that the country has naively come to expect near perfect track record from isro sometimes its easy to forget that what we re experimenting with is quite literally rocket science getting nation full of people who say space programs are waste of money to be glued to their tv sets at am in the morning is an achievement in itself isro has just inspired lot of young minds to take up space science as field of interest instead of youth saying want to work at nasa we might find them saying want to work for isro wake up vikram you have lot more people to inspire deleted that journalist pallava bagla was complete asshole for being so rude at the press conf well done isro the lander didn work out but you re still in orbit and collecting data that a big win in itself your flag will be on the surface soon enough one kid is literally asking how to become president personally m still hopeful all the banter name calling and vitriol aside godforbid if communication doesn get restored you guys should really be proud of the monumental and prolonged effort and skill that went into reaching as far as you have reached this is no small feat for nation every moment of this mission has provided your scientists valuable information information that which was not handed to you by another country these sort of attempts contribute in building culture of making attempts in previously uncharted territory we all know success greets those who make attempts everybody who tries something for the st time will be at disadvantage learning from it is where it at success after such setbacks is sweetest and much more meaningful imagine how many indian kids in school will be inspired imagine how many more indian young adults will be part of the next mission that is how you teach nation to dream big having ambitions that traverse petty human squabbles is what gives nation its future today is historic day for you all it another chapter added to the story of india years from now many of you will be sharing with your kids the story of today be proud guys did anyone else see the short de briefing the journalists absolutely hounded the speaker because the chairperson didn show up why should they act like this so far imgur com svozjat png goosebumps moment when pragyan tyre tracks showed the national emblem mean in the animated video explaining pragyan mission edit it there in isro yt channel did kid just ask question about reservation dear scientists we are proud of you space is tough only the vikram has failed the orbiter mission was successful that too it has lost contact it might set back our manned moon mission bit because this is what isro was trying soft landing m sure there will be another mission soon gg damn chief do not cry you did the best hopefully this teaches people that failures are part of life and should be accepted fawad chaudhary takes dig on isro what an absolute cunt of guy he is people on the pakistani sub are also embarrassed by his lack of ingenuity there have been other pakistani trolls who now see this as an opportunity to confront india let make this clear it has nothing to do with politics its just jealousy and hatred that can be seen embedded in their hearts one pakistani guy replied to post mocking india achievement saying the thing is dusron ki nakamyabi pe khush hone wale log mujhe mentally healthy nahi lagte hain chahe koi bhi ho india ho ya pak ya world me kahin bhi jo bat hai so hai nidhi razdan executive editor for ndtv tweeted twitter com nidhi status ref src twsrc egoogle ctwcamp eserp ctwgr etweet dear folks who are reacting to senior pakistan minister tasteless comments on isro please don respond to him he behaving like troll poor man stayed up all night to watch the moon mission their india obsession continues we don have to obsess in return lot of other people have flooded his post with lip smacking replies that would have made him reflect on his lack of judgment this also goes to us as an indian as citizen of mature nation we must not indulge in blatant mockery of anyone just out of bitter spite and envy know for fact that the intellectual elite in pakistan would not stoop down to this level but seeing federal minister for science technology gives me sense of incertitude feel bad for sivan his voice was literally shaking bollywood chaand sifarish jo karta hamari deta wo tumko btaa isro we ll get his personal statement just hang on bruh am legit feeling bad for the scientists have question doesn orbiter have camera attached to it can it show what actually happened to the lander ps dont know much about it was just speculating but literal chills so proud to the people who are calling it technology demonstration it is not exactly technology demonstration chandrayaan was more of technology demonstration even though it had some good payloads chandrayaan is not technology demonstration the orbiter is carrying many payloads and is full fledged lunar mission in itself on par with either esa or nasa the lander too has some good payloads and the landing mission is in and itself one of the engineering target ve worked on the rover movement the rover is the closest to technology demonstration even though it carries couple of payloads if landing on moon was this hard for lander just imagine landing people on moon and that too in fucking and bringing them back home safely how the fuc neil degrasse tyson speaking live on times now never expected him to see on indian television if kerbal space program has taught me anything it is to try again learn from your mistakes and keep at it until you succeed hope isro can make it in anothet mission best of luck next time don cut off the feed for fuck sake let people see the harsh reality may be success or failure but let us see that we are still proud of out scientists and everyone working on this project deleted reasons data can be lost the lander malfunctioned went in too hard and crashed thus destroying the transmitter the transmitter malfunctioned but the lander did manage to carry on and survive xb most likely its number but even if the lander did manage to survive it can really function without data transmission isro chief sivan to ani we ve found the location of vikramlander on lunar surface and orbiter has clicked thermal image of lander but there is no communication yet we are trying to have contact it will be communicated soon twitter com timesofindia status removed windows is now rebooting to apply updates neil degrasse tyson being an absolute person of positivity his words are so motivating am feeling very bad for him removed deleted think of what momentous achievement this is to have come from smattering of diverse cultures pedigrees and kingdoms exploited by colonial masters to maintaining most diverse and robust union from being vessel of the worlds pity to being able to emulate and in some aspects supersede the achievements of soviets and the americans with both our arms tied behind our backs what we as indians achieved here today is still significant and more than any other nation can lay claim to the object of science is progress we successfully launched an efficient and cost effective mission to the moon it was ambitious and indigenous that in itself is worth century of pride the certainty that we will be able to learn move on and get there next time makes me happy the nat geo host seems to be good putting this mission on livestream should only go on to show how difficult the work that the ladies and gents over at isro do immense respect for every single person involved and hope this brings more of the bright folks into the field gg listening to neil degrasse tyson at am count this as an absolute win didn feel this bad even after my math board exam and that exam was fucking tragedy bhai jyaada le le bus land karaa de some kid actually asked about reservation lol that falling short of odd kms made me cry can truly understand what the isro scientists and staff may be going through non political just an isro fanboy where can find official isro merch we need to commemorate chandrayaan forever ya it failed but brighter side is that orbiter is still working absolutely perfectly the moon is india backyard neil degrasse tyson from twitter aksharpathak everyone like oh why is chandrayaan landing so late in the night won be up to see it what else were you expecting ki day mein land hoga how is that possible din mein moon hota nahi you idiots twitter com aksharpathak status an expert on dd says the velocity was supposed to be m when we saw around m doesn sound good during the live descent trajectory plot that was displayed on screen it can be seen that the green line represented actual trajectory and the red line represented planned trajectory image for reference cdn thewire in wp content uploads screenshot at am png cdn thewire in wp content uploads screenshot at am png could someone theorize or attempt to explain as to why the green dot representing the lander proceeded and eventually stopped until km but the official announcement mentioned that communications were lost at km above the surface how exactly was isro measuring the vertical altitude of the lander might be little off topic but really want watch this on big screen portrayal of failures is as important as success believe they can be more inspiring considering success is build on layers of failures failures are often stereotyped really hope someone comes up with it heard one of the scientists say kya btaogae ghar pe what will you inform at home this hurts man we are proud of our scientists they have created history no need to lose heart our scientists have done great job jai hind arvind kejriwal it hard to see after so much anticipation that we couldn reach the mark this would be remarkable takeaway for isro and for it quest in doing something valuable for the country the mission was allocated at cost of rs crores which is around million dollars the prime minister was there consoling the scientists social media has been supportive every citizen has backed them and we continue to do the pm mentioned the moment when the announcement was made about the lost in communication the scientists received major shock the pm consoled them and the emotional chairman mr sivan which was heart breaking to watch mahn that for me shows the amount of dedication our intelligent minds put to explore the world this as mentioned will be major takeaway isro is still trying to access communication and we hope for the best as always some have said that the whole mission should had undergone in secrecy and others object to it by saying that it takes lot of courage to show your failures there were also people who commented on the downfall of the economy stating that india should get it priorities right we as nation intellectual minds proceed relentlessly towards development and major breakthroughs in the stem field there will always be ups and downs like these and it is the fundamental duty of every citizen to encourage and motivate anyone on the quest for the incredible mera bharat desh mahaan jai hind rs extra lelo bas land kara do looks like it crash landed there were two other communication systems in place outside of india and all three of them isro lost communication most probable cause is hardware malfunction of vikram hope m wrong though hope it just comes back when everyone is about to leave like in hindi movie we go again space is hard guys we go again hope those kids don lose morale and take it as challenge and pursue career in astronomy and get us success in future group hugs all am not certain but think it was curiosity or opportunity rover where nasa tried and made the rover fit inside huge ball think it was and the ball just absorbed all the entry impact in mars and then opened up for the rover to explore could we have tried something of that sort or am too naive so the landing was guided or non guided what bewilders me is the fact that people are so dejected with the lost communication as if it is all over for starters let me tell you such missions are fully automated so there is significant possibility that the lander might be sitting duck on the moon strongly believe that our scientists would have contingency plan to relay communication using the orbiter for that we have to wait till the orbiter is in the right position otherwise if the lander has crash landed on the surface then its debris would be captured by the orbiter till then there is hope did vikram die hope he is alive up there please don give front row seat to the isha yoga guy or any one who feeds on gullibility spreads misinformation showcases utter disregard and disrespect towards science not because hate those kind of people but because you re insulting hardworking people of isro and other people who have contributed to the mission imo front row seats should belong only to scientists and journalists who have dedicated their life towards progress of science motherfucker mujhse pehli try mein code compile nahi hota and these guys are landing shit on the motherfucking moon feel so stupid did we lose contact or shit we might have some bad news it looks like lander should have sent confirmation by now this was the first moment which made me feel something has gone wrong imgur com iesrng jpg semi final wali feeling stop hitting him he did the best he could maybe next time better not bad from kaka good thing to hear for the scientists know what it like to lose to feel so desperately that you re right yet to fail nonetheless it frightening turns the legs to jelly ask you to what end dread it run from it destiny arrives all the same orbiter is still fine let hope for the best what exactly happened is the rover landed but lost communication or no status known of landing just want to say am proud that we tried it and did it the best possible way hope isro has better data now to do next landing with more precision jeevan me utar chadhav ate rehte hai lekin ye chota achievement nahi hai aapne bahut kuch sikhaya hai hame himmat ke sath chale mai aapke sath hun wish you all the best pm to isro scientists loud angry question by ndtv reporter pallava bagla about why chairman wasn here to announce this instead of junior spokesperson some uncomfortable stares data is being analyzed more awkward than that lander failure why is the green line moving away from the red one hope that is not the case but think that the spacecraft has crashed at mins the data stopped updating and the scientists starting getting concerned when looking at the numbers the last update was that the craft had horizontal descent velocity of m at bit under m height which is nearly km and vertical descent velocity of m which is around km to put it in perspective the craft was descending at speed faster than most if not all trains running in this country reading modi last tweet seems like there is no revival and the vikram lander mission has failed more power to the scientists though worked like crazy hard for everything last km and bam right in the feels man indian parents will hate neil uncle for his tips given to the students wonder what happened to vikram after we lost contact did it drift away from the moon surface or crash land on it twitter com fawadchaudhry status twitter com fawadchaudhry status he is t minister of pakistan removed have grown up with isro have seen more failed mission live than successful ones isro really struggled post sanctions it was time when our workhorse pslv also used to fail but never saw such negativity back then of course there were not much of social media back then and people were not so invested either only door darshan tv channel used to broadcast some snippets during launch hell used to find launch timings buried deep into newspapers but isro always came through they struggled through cryogenic engines and gslv too but look how the tamed those naughty beasts rocket science is tricky and history teaches us that it can be perfected only by trial error look at drdo missile programs its rather high failure rates is an assurance that we are indeed doing our own d and not just p imported tech today we have comprehensive missile program which can say proudly is mostly indigenous and we have isro to thank it for just this week iaf placed unfaltering confidence on our own akash defense system over much sophisticated israeli system true joyus occasion isro will come through have faith xb the important thing is we must not get demoralized we have to try again next decade is important and we might see moon rush again after nasa artemis mission to the infinity and beyond isro chrisg nsf if vikram failed to land which it looks like remember the orbiter is where of the experiments are the orbiter is safely in lunar orbit and performing its mission this is not total failure not at all chandrayaan india moonlanding vikramlander twitter com chrisg nsf status finally some good news for us hope isro nails the landing shit modi leaving itna to boards results lie tension nhi hui their body language is saying it all feels bad man they have worked so hard ight imma head out satisfaction lies in the effort not in the attainment full effort is full victory mahatma gandhi bit unfortunate but it still something to take pride in not many countries can even attempt something like this hopefully we will learn from this and will successfully land the next one it official now lander communications was lost around kms above surface data being analysed the last data was like km altitude and s velocity believe when they lost signal thats quite high velocity everyone can bask in success and offer congratulations its in times of adversities like these when we get to see who is truly supporting the space mission and who all are just bandwagoning for success snap back to reality oh there goes gravity genius com eminem lose yourself lyrics note back to the lab again happiest person right now is akshay kumar he now doesn only have patriotic script but patriotic emotional thrilling suspense script the only bad thing about this is dd broadcast that shit is old af good guy modi consolled sivan before finally leaving the greatest success with this mission was that how many people will now aspire to study stem m bit out of the loop here will we see live video of the landing streamed didn even know if that possible but wasn the moon landing seen live in bruh why the fuck is gaurav kapoor hosting this on hotstsar this is funniest thing ve seen in long time not receiving data it seems what is going on right now seems like chilled silence did it crash fuck this is nerve wrecking don wanna go mr stark think we still did good guys may be we will do lot better next time the orbiter will still collect the data so that good news the faces say it all it gone splat always liked space explorations used to have one small step as ringtone this was my chance to witness am so nervous have no idea what happened but at the same time the faces on the screen tell me that know what happened damn everyone looking sad as fuck for respect and gg for the efforts that kids from bhutan looked so scared oh plz this is the starting of memes statement coming watching the opportunity time lapse video on the surface of mars made me jealous there could have been similar videos of the moon from c so close yet so far everyone at isro rn pbs twimg com media edzvyklucaaxqg format jpg name x kid is asking him about reservations and he fucked right out of there lol complete switch off karke switch on try kiya kya sonakshi sinha knows it need the bollywood twist come on vikram isro chief if he pats me on the back one more time any of you feeling bad for working for corporate and not some organization like isro omg the commentator is about to go down on modi we re in the end game now stuck in drs cmon the suspense is killing me think they ve told the pm that its failed problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to the computer what data issa okay shit happens efforts people it would ve been wierd if the pm had bolted without giving this pep talk livestreams ended on all platforms d say that the confirmation saw the last distance from the surface as but the contact was lost at km from the surface so how was it tracked till what am missing here am not gonna lose is there going to be livestream on youtube what if instead of water chandrayan finds oil on moon and we see press conference by trump that they will bring democracy to the moon chalo koi nhi boys played well space is hard man unknown shit walking in dark nobody to give hand once lost lost rare unscripted speech from modi just try again it took hundreds of billions for us to land person on moon india spent only million yet modi looks visibly annoyed with the kids poor scientists look scared fuck this shit man the pressure of mission success and on top of that the pressure from seniors and politician for their pr fuck this can we absolutely not get political and shift the attention to the scientists bruh they were made excited for this shit and all busy commenting about how modi needs to stfu what else can he do at this moment to be really honest hate his politics but respect to him for the speech and answers guys the orbiter is still there and will remain there for another year meanwhile pragyaan was supposed to be there for weeks this mission was not complete failure like some people are making it to be hopefully our students will take this in positive manner and strive to achieve more in science our country needs more scientists doctors and engineers akshay kumar probably crying as he can make next film removed it crashed because lander ne paao upar nahi kiye they m abuzz it almost pm here and we re having moon landing party between roommates granted most of them are irish who just want reason to drink but we re buzzed nonetheless what better is that my whole extended family seems to be up ve already talked to uncles and cousins even got sharma ji ka beta from my mom this is the time to stand with the scientists not abandon them yesyesyesno at least it will stay on the moon forever and was the first object to land on the south bhai jyada lele buss land kara do did modi just took an unscripted question modiji in bachon ko hi ab se interview dunga getting super scary it was travelling around kmph if it lost contact at ms did it go splat at ms into the ground or was the trajectory preprogrammed it so fucking crazy seeing all this unfold live houston we ve problem huge for our boy vikram telemetry is lost and no rf received were some faint voices near the control panel looks like crash fuck why does this seem so scripted did they get the data back did anyone see the lander doing flip right before landing during fine braking phase on those illustrations visuals chalo bhaiyoo friday night kaafi wild rahi ab sojaate first mudiji fucks off then they cut the live isro feed dafuq is going on it looks bad guys aaah man anybody has an idea that how much time goes into analysis of the said data aliens got to it mera vikram aayega people said there would be some announcement link so when we will get first update from orbiter as isro reached for the moon its scientists face pay cuts as the nation gets hyped with praise pouring in from all corners isro scientists aren quit happy with the recent decision of the govt to reduce salaries of about rs month this is the absolute opposite of the decision that approved for double hikes in salaries the appeal has been penned by the chairman of sea space engineers association the government order talks of the performance related incentive scheme pris which it says should not affect the decision of the double increments for isro staffers because pris does not affect the basic income of any government servant the whole article thewire in government as isro reached for the moon its scientists faced pay cuts vikram found confirms isro but it is in tilted position economictimes indiatimes com news science chandrayaan lander vikram not broken lying in tilted position isro official articleshow cms deleted m sad thinking about this lander crash imagine the sadness felt by people when columbia exploded on live tv what thrilling experience for folks working at isro akshay kumar has nice script for movie can we stop showering attention on every move modi makes and actually focus on the scientists ffs theres plenty of time to bash him but this isnt one im legitimately feeling sad about this here is the first line of the control module code om shri ganeshaaya namah yo this looks fooking interesting probably some kid who watched this these guys are no nonsense if they knew it has failed they would have announced it by now there still might be sliver of chance fingers crossed that we can emerge stronger from this and funding is not cut if am not wrong nat geo is actually airing show in which the channel will telecast chanderyaan landing on moon surface and the show will probably be shown around pm perhaps bgm for youtu be mzvvgjrtp those terrifying minutes ready space universe yt www youtube com watch zijmwadhy seems to be the one stream showing live feedback is it from the orbiter even official isro is not showing that stream update am none of the mission control screens seems to show what space universe is showing it seems very suspicious are they just showing some old pre recorded lunar video update am yep what they were showing till now was old video from some lunar mission they have now switched to mission control video like all other streams is that internet explorer lol matlab im so excited fingers crossed from their looks feels like scientists needs good sleep all with the puffed tired eyes hope all goes well and they get one doesnt look good not receiving telemetry from mauritius no signal coming in from mauritius station the longer it goes on the worse the chances of success doesn look good guys massive klpd bc fuck we all jinxed it pls pls fuck modi is going down so close imgur com ivysgci png why it feels like this is drama and soon they will celebrate they fuckimg with everyone mil gaya data wait did someone mention ssr is receiving data damn they cut the feed looks like attempt only bois why are the tables squiggly rather than straight genuine question minutes since the link was lost listening to man on the moon in memory of our boi vikram and lil bro pragyan heartbreaking m so sad has this mission failed or there is still some hope modi leaving is giving mixed signals unrelated but why are so many of those kids wearing glasses looks like failure in the late stage of the lander we are gonna come back for sure but this is gonna hurt for while word from isro in next minutes wait joe rahul shivshankar rogan bhai lele bas land karade yeh pubg wala hain kya this is like the climax of movie scene fuckkk plssss kaka bhaag gaya while it sad at least it was not manned mission the only loss is material neil degrasse tyson on times now never thought d say that good job lads remember that state of unity costed three times more than chandra yaan why has everyone in this thread given up vikram is automated and loss of signal doesn mean that it crashed go to sleep guys there probably won be any big updates till the morning they ll corroborate and confirm the landing malfunction in few more hours can already see the akshay kumar starring biopic mission success so far orbiter is the main mission lander and rover is like tech demonstration and milestone that we landed on the surface hope we wake up in the morning with good news crash landing is landing too ground control to major tom your circuit dead there something wrong can you hear me major tom can you hear me major tom can you hear me major tom can you here am floating round my tin can far above the moon planet earth is blue and there nothing can do one small step for vikram one giant leap for billion let go amit bhai kuch karo halat tight it reached till meters seems like it lost the projected path there after and hit ground on uneven level hope the rover is still okay and does its work but first communication with lander is must oh you crore gods wake up wake up modi said bye mission failed we ll get em next time can anyone sum up what happened really lost here rip youtube stream as soon as modi left pm to address nation at am from isro control centre rahul shivshankar on times now world looks out of his depth lol edit misspelt his name why do they have hindi and english in the same stream dont like to hear the same thing times are there english only streams anywhere the descent phase begins almost like watching thriller good luck guys will we get to see the real live stream from the satellite history in the making like how everyone is in formals but this one dude comes in jacket man that people at isro are excited as kids their so much hard work is finally paying off oh fuck what happening fuck me something is definately off rn patience thoda patience looks bad guys the orbiter will still be running so at least there that did we lost the communication with the probe bhai panga ho gya its recieving dtaa hang in there mates the rf to orbiter is for the orbiter not vikram arrey koi confirm karo rf bhai terror wala phase khatam hi nhi ho rha hopefully the orbiter can carry on with its experiments even if vikram has issues feed re started live stream announcement just now said only that the vehicle was observed until certain altitude then communications were lost they have not specified loss of the landing vehicle but it is implied this is sad peetega kya saley ya looks like crash modi giving pick up speech damn man feel so sad when is the next moon mission november is this first major failure it is taking so long because ibm is doing the rca was landing automatic or manual did the lander take commands from here at each step of the way or the process was completely handled by itself with all the commands on it already yo introvertedguy whatever can you go secs without making some cringy reference nobody wants to see it well isro does have the balls to livestream it though m watching india today live and they are doing everything they can to not admit that the lander crashed they keep saying the landing is delayed and reiterating praise for modi for not shitting on the scientists as if that a high bar rocket science is fucking hard they shouldn be ashamed to admit that this is setback deleted think the pm left we all know what that means boys modi ight imma head out experts at home solar battery phook gayi removed remember to play this as it lands xb www youtube com watch kfdrgopa www youtube com watch kfdrgopa xb people who grew up in the will understand scenes if the computer bluescreens need more practice playing kerbal space program it seems need cigarette data is being analysed modi is leaving that it boys can we see our scientists please they matter the most here loads and loads of mud sledging will happen but just remwber your every word and criticism will be directed towards those hardworking scientists if had it been success it would be shared among all but when its failure it will be of scientists that just how it is so just be careful lol just watched the pm dodge question on reservation removed neil tyson ne times now ki trp bada di idk why but am feeling so sad right now and can control it hope will get to hear good news on the morning so is it confirmed dead well guess no new movie from akshay kumar yo idiots you ll have plenty of opportunities to shit on modi and the gov later some unity and compassion right now wouldn go amiss most of the scientists looks like my neighborhood kulcha uncles and aunties whatever the agenda maybe but kudos to kaka for being there and talking to all the people and asking them to be courageous fuck it looks like it crashed wait modi leaving why this is just like dhoni waiting till the end saying not yet to hit those runs in last over fingers crossed all is well if vikram has crashed how will we know it at least we tried seems like crash boys martians got the landing craft the raeson for feed cut might also be partially that some passionate folks might have started crying modi alos said be courageous yep it over that be courageous line confirmed it lander landed on the moon and the communication between lander and orbiter is back we will need to check the whereabouts of lander from orbiter lastly the rover can still be activated and made to do his walk let hope for best wrong question at very wrong time girl good man modi first time since he became pm am happy by his words for those scientists his words will lift their morals be courageous economy ka kuch dekho be courageous man this is one time when didn want to hear any pep talk why did they cut feed gimme my right to information pondicherry ko wadakkam neil degrasse tyson is live on times now timesofindia indiatimes com live tv this is mission control centre vikramlander descent was as planned and normal performance was observed up to an altitude of km subsequently communication from lander to the ground stations was lost data is being analyzed isro twitter com isro status regardless of the mission outcome can someone shed some light as to why we were focusing on moon instead of mars where there a possibility of sustaining life get that no one has explored the dark side of the moon or whatever it is called but is it more important than mars we do have plans for mars but suppose if we focused more on that instead of moon then that mission will have greater chance at success about time people why is this thread dead it happening ruh oh something screwed up or what signal not being received god damn has it landed telemetry lost mission control center looking grim no celebrations so far is bad only madrid station is replying to the signal it finished fine braking correct is everything alright it seems something is not alright god plssss damn my heart is racing hoping for the best worried the mood is looking terrible across the room looks like its crashed yo data pack recharged they have communication with the orbiter did she just say confirmed receiving data was that question or statement they cut the feed oh god the uncertainity is getting unbearable why is the feed showing still image m so confused what is going on if it was hard land or crash what the odds of pragyan being ok data being analysed hmm stating the obvious but what can he do can the orbiter or satellite capture image of the landing site who is the astronaut on the hotstar stream hotstar stream is slow compared to youtube what happens to that spacecraft debris there cool this is why you don need to turn this into fucking promotional program space is hard first thing that crept into my mind was wow they must be so confident they are literally live telecasting the event still waiting and hoping that it just some communication error till date only three countries russia the us and china have successfully soft landed on moon windows update well s in the chat for all of us who are going to be late tomorrow to school college office sigh also for vikram rip rip rip deleted they should hire an astrologer to use his divya drishti to see what happened deleted the livestreams ended when pm left that sad makes one think if it was all about his visit debriefing from scientist before ending the stream could have helped why is modi shown so prominently in lunar landing event how are the kids not posting stories smh is this digital india now this is cringe please stop guys can you updoot this thread to what with grown men giving red roses to modiji scientist aunty is announcing something lets hope for the best but it doesn look good at all oof isro stream cut it is still proud moment for us guys we will come back stronger the best thing modi can say is that we are going to try again chandrayaan landed just not the way it was supposed to deleted they re clapping lot that good right it crashed right shit come on we need win here after all that happening looks like they exhausted their claps early who is going to give modi the bad news the police walked by the cameraman and the camera cut off to another one hmmmmm must be bad feeling for the kids kaka is back mission failed we ll get em next time youtu be leslwvdug feel like he says the same things everywhere has it crashed or no signal modi kaha gya not to worry modi ji is now on the floor deleted maybe it landed and was attacked by the israeli tardigrades watching it live on hotstar it all seems so scripted do hope it is and they announce that the mission is success like it happens in movie after almost failing in something modi is not ready for questions lol this hitting is getting annoying mr modi alright clap clap clap almost there vertical descent shortly why is everyone tensed what happening suspence guys suspence do no worry all will be well boys played well better luck next time it would be great to be provided an update on if when the orbiter can scan the landing site and provide an assessment assuming the onboard systems of the lander are knocked offline by the landing maneuvers looks like the orbiter is receiving data or was that question feed cut www youtube com watch ivlohsmi vg this duffer modi spoils my mood he wants to use everything for pr this should be only and only about isro scientists modi came to take credit leaves when landing fails but honestly respect to modi for handling the response well think that pep talk was much needed for the scientists at isro may we reach greater heights now am really worried about the manned space mission m blaming the inauspicious presence of modi chanda mama so gaye suraj chachu jage seems very relevent now deleted isro chairman briefing kaka kaka must be saying amit ko call lagaun kya kuch jugaad kar dega nehru you son of bitch you ve done it again neil armstrong was so damn lucky man agla wala mars me bhejo it should walk more than opportunity rover it likely failed they just want to wait for the signal to confirm it social media is like its not module kisika bachcha kho gaya ho lmao maybe people should give two shits about issues that they actually can influence is wikipedia down for you guys too likely not the cause but it may be us indians looking up shit edit it up when modi came felt like he was bit off thinking about something else there is shit about somrthing which makes him stressed oit fuck am getting panic attacks now god plss let something move think it crashed but am still very proud of isro they have done amazing work in this mission too ndtv ka kehna ki bht tez takraya isliye singal toot gya deleted yes modi lol yo sathvik this is awesome glad that other countries explore space other than us russia and china km the distance between success and failure feel sad for the scientists who have worked hard for so many years also modi is such bad omen deleted nehru is responsible for this guess all the praying and astrology really does not work www outlookindia com website story india news opinion was isro chief right in offering prayers ahead of chandrayaan launch wtf why does it look like pr exercise with the pm now we want to know the status in the control room monn modi wtf that his speech wtf person so well at giving speeches really those two words modi is so ready to fire off tweet like the cost if this mission is less than the budget of avengers endgame deleted deleted oh god here goes gobhi with his pseudo philosophical ramblings again reminder that wastage of public resources in country of poverty is the same type of rhetoric used by sanghis to discredit phd scholars like kanhaiya shehla rashid etc where did modi go now where it all begins fake news ngl she kinda cute doe what her was up all night nvm props to isro for attempting it got done oof there is no official announcement yet but agar it fails then modi credits kaise lega saare now is the the time we put some money into some real research and development we have to learn from these mistakes and improve ourselves it a bit irritating to hear the mission was success for almost years isro has been putting payloads into orbits of various kinds this time what was different and unique was the payload had to descend and be soft landed with baby hands and then the rover part which was huge if the descent worked both the new and unique parts of the mission didn succeed so you could argue that the mission was success prefer to say that this shouldn be looked at binary way they ve got to be learning from this experience what failed thrusters or some other subsystem or what failed the mission itself was strategically wrong you were trying to land in an area where it was impossible to nail proper landing or you wanted to be st rank guinness that peculiar indian need to be first in something first people to land in the hardest spot on the lunar surface and whatever happened to walk before you run why not try an easy landing on an easy area hindsight tells us even that not easy hope bhakts doesn blame it on nehru edit lmao bhakts triggered pragyan will not stray too far from the vikram lander given that its maximum range only extends over metres bit of an anti climax or klpd this have strong feeling that they lie to us now unpopular opinion m very disappointed by the way isro govt is handling this failure they should have come forward with actual data every amateur astronomer and enthusiast found that the lander was moving at velocity in which it is not possible to descent safely just by looking at the parameters on the mission screens so why lie to your tax payers which made this mission possible least they didn do balakot and lie to the world that the lander had landed and rover functioned as planned failure was expected it was hard mission kudos to the every person involved but have lost faith that any public organization in the country would provide factual data as long as this govt is in power perhaps future govt will follow the suit as well considering how well this strategy works to sway the public opinion deleted removed pm modi obviously hasn left he just praying to god jee whatta wonderful man deleted modi and his speeches sigh what if it crashes like the indian economy edit had to add the even don want it to crash smh deleted well the real question is whether the lander was tested in all scenarios with the right sort of stress tests of course the intent here isn to question the abilities of scientists but to understand why and hopefully futuristic missions learn from it also there was an initial snag and then they deferred and then they again changed it in short while as general public we are obviously proud of frugality of isro but accountability can be overlooked it just blows my mind the soviets did it in more than years before we are so far behind ab toh modi phas gaya sab kuch live stream pe hai koi surgical strike type exaggerate karke bol bhi nahi sakta is this lady telling or asking data received so confusing minutes of lost communication and the entire bjp machinery went into panic mode kashmir has been without communication for month now removed looking at the bright side atleast modi the braggart didnt get to take the credit for this big mission if this was successful you re certain he have built his entire election agenda on roaming around the world boasting about his credentials taking credit for this ironic for someone as anti science as him didn dr sivan perform puja for the success of the mission what happened why did modi give that speech have we succeeded please somebody inform the news is nonsense it performed oof not rocket scientist here but shouldn isro gone for something like parachute landing with protective bouncing covering like nasa did with mars rover wonder what the logic was to land it with powered engines believe km is doable height for parachute landings my cents removed deleted probably lander ran out of battery maybe just need to be recharge by solar light deleted removed ffs don want modiji lecture now did they try turning it off then on again f technology in india is not there yet crores of tax payers money wasted thanks isro welp huge failure deleted well now we can focus on issues in the country hopefully we re running out of ground water deleted what failure deleted why the hell is it taking such long time to land this damn thing mean it was launched some days ago wasn it pm in boys played well inshallah mode removed 
why is engineering so promoted across india and it not even very good career choice www reddit com india comments cwfxi why is engineering so promoted across india and it a rant cum question that why is engineering so much promoted across india that too software engineering it not like very good career choice m fresher and got placed from my college and working for around months now but wtf is people obsession is with this field it not field where you are earning lot or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful even after years when you become project manager you may earn lpa but still you re not like rich like you can do whatever you want you re still blind by office timing it not like you can take vacation whenever you want to also one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate hours in front of computer and hours in traffic for days week and wait for weekends to complete your sleep also if technology changes and you don know that or do not learn the technology your career takes hit just don get it the obsession behind the computer science field why parents put this on their children and how can they be proud of this like what are you proud of that your child is sitting in front of computer for hours and work like slave  it might not be what interests you but all things included it is better job than nearly everything else out there right after graduation in most jobs engineering or otherwise you have to sit in front of the computer for hours and you cannot take vacation when you want and you don even come close to earning what software engineer earns it is also the one field where you can get jobs right out of college you can say about doctors but not everyone has the memorization capacity dedication and the amount of time and money required to be one the only other alternatives are having business or working as freelancer on contract basis in the first you are your own boss and can take vacations but end up worrying about the business also you need substantial capital to start one and most startups fail the second option of freelancer is very unstable one indian parents are most concerned about job stability and finding suitable wedding match in both of which software engineering takes prime spot unless you have an mba of course hey one doubt became project manager but did not get the lpa kahan complaint karoon hear what you are saying work around technology and the completely temporary nature of the skills and how often you have to start all over and learn all new skills and technology makes me really stressed want my kids to understand bit about tech but don know that want them to do it as career assuming op is right and he fucking not professions where earning more than lpa is possible after years are ca politician not sure legally though own business actor at least tv show lead doctor cricket there maybe more but let look at these first now compare the contacts influence money luck and most importantly time required to do moderately well in any of these fields as compared to engineering hence confirmed op trying to be edgy it not field where you are earning lot wrong maybe you re not earning enough your compensation depends on your negotiation skills and your technical skills you are not your own boss in which job you are your boss when you re fresher your not job is respectful wrong maybe your job is not respectful don project your own on others after years when you become project manager you may earn lpa don know if people earn this much if they become pm you may earn lpa but still you re not like rich like you can do whatever you want wrong you ve poor money management and investment skills you re still blind by office timing wrong you work for shitty company it not like you can take vacation whenever you want to wrong you work for shitty company also one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate wrong that for every job if you don know how to take care of yourself hours in front of computer wrong hours in traffic wrong not every city is bangalore even in bangalore not everyone spends hours in traffic wait for weekends to complete your sleep wrong poor time management skill on your part also if technology changes and you don know that or do not learn the technology wrong fundamentals always remain the same your career takes hit just don get it yes if you weren good at fundamentals the obsession behind the computer science field why parents put this on their children maybe your parents did not everyone parents are same as yours and how can they be proud of this ask your parents that your child is sitting in front of computer for hours and work like slave don sit in front of your computer for hours then and don work like slave have some self respect so what is good career choice am an engineer too got my degree from one of the best engineering college in india have been working hard for last years now can buy jio net pack without asking money from family this is how success looks like fuck that wish d made an effort in school and landed up an engineer the least resistant path to success if you wanna hit certain milestones in life financial engineering is the quickest engineering has provided better platform for us middle class folks to have secure settled life which is an aspiration for most of the middle class because we have no scope for apprenticeship education like plumbers electricians these professions are looked down upon we indians despise those who work with their hands blue collar jobs as result only two professional lines are open since engineering is cheaper degree years lacs as opposed to mbbs year lacs most students opt for it lol it an excellent career option but then you need to be competent and competitive one of the things in india is that there is natural progression for your education school plus engg mbbs degree masters if applicable the number of students who try to think out of this and the number of parents who allow their wards to think out of this is pretty few there is also the factor of not many students getting good mentor to get different direction or at least get enough knowledge about the other options in terms of the work as someone said below almost every profession nowadays demands that you spend time in front of computer this is not applicable only if you are in the sales field or factory worker supervisor or really unskilled labor anywhere where you are in an educated position or even at the managerial level in factory you will necessarily end up spending lot of time in front of the computer doing lot of documentation and reporting work at least think the essence is to get job which interests and excites the mind and in addition try to get good remuneration for the same which can support yourself your family and whoever is required along with the demonization of engineering and stem studies is incredible engineering is hard and good jobs in india are scarce the main problem is not everyone can be good engineer then when people are not capable of doing good engineering they despise it does not mean engineering jobs are bad perhaps you are in bad company or in bad job in good company or both if don have have attitude or interest or both for engineering quit right way and do mba mba jobs require more soft skills than hard skills so you can bull shit away even if you are not interested the fact that you think of becoming project manager in years just as you have started your career shows you have no interest in the fun part of engineering so think it is much better you train for project management with mba but if you think engineering is fun or you have the aptitude for it then sky is the limit immigration has been never so easier and there are also great companies in india depending on your interest if you are looking for just money you are better of selling soaps and chocolates in fcmg the typical it companies even after their worst working conditions offer much better than other industries and good possibility to immigrate or to find great indian company to help find satisfying job please stop demotivating others with such rants problem with months of work ex people with years of work ex make lakhs unless year work ex guys are coming to your office in bmws audis you re in for another reality check soon lpm in years sure will like to smoke whatever it is you are smoking shitting on it is the new fad amongst millennials like shitting on chetan baghat it is not very good career choice wow what else is like serpantsociety told most aspects of your questions is wrong it is hugely responsible for providing parity to the middle classes of semi urban and rural india and that is fact earning lpa whilst working hour day job sounds pretty awesome to someone who grew up in middle class mediocrity am sorry but our life experiences are pretty different from those with the privilege of being born in circumstances where money isn important need some help guys currently have options to choose from which one should go for if am doing engineering from teir college mechanical engineering civil engineering computer engineering am not passionate about either of those but will do anyone of them without any problem as can work hard and get degree easily just want field which is safe for the future and guarantees decent job with decent salary which one should prioritize first and the least any advice is appreciated this post is ignorance at its finest engineering is key profession for building an economy from top to bottom when india was looking to modernize its infrastructure and economy they need ed lot more engineers to do it they had options bring in engineers from outside or train bunch locally which they chose to do while india has seen improvements across the board in infrastructure and economic growth they have trained more engineers than they need and now have bit of glut of engineers with how supply and demand works the average wage of those engineers has fallen the us is seeing something similar in health care as the baby boomer generation dies off the smaller number of gen s aren filling up the hospitals and assisted living facilities that where built up for the boomers now those facilities are starting to close and we have glut of doctors and nurses so the wages for both are falling lpa some people earn that much in their entire career while doing much more strenuous physical labour if you re earning that much you can in most places afford to live near your office drastically cutting down your commutation time as for your health that depends on the individuals initiative and lifestyle whether you re earning or crores there always risk of you losing everything as you said in years you might earn lpa if one is talented and ready to keep on learning forever there is no limit plus it is slightly easier to get into this field the indian education system demands an ideal of memory oriented teaching studying exam taking not very hard to learn given decent effort no little actual skills has some demand in the market e there is greater chance of getting some kind of job with the degree than not enables wider variety of careers than most alternatives minor good for visas demanding years undergrad education most ba bsc etc courses are years which creates problems for some visas which enables colleges can charge decent not great money for such courses and the investment of setting up college acquiring accreditation etc is reasonable as compared to setting up medical college say and has some kind of cash flow positive business model though recently the glut of such colleges has killed this engineering as taught in india ticks all these boxes and to be fair given how the rest of the education system fares engineering is decent default for your typical unfocused student to choose it an easy way to earn decent salary furthermore being modestly successful engineer or programmer doesn take ton of innate talent you might have something special if you get into top ranked program but most people going into the profession are ordinary folks with lot of pressure behind them there are other ways to succeed but think indian parents steer their kids away from them because they re not stable certain or surefire routes to success the same dynamic exists in other parts of the world being programmer is better way of ensuring upwards socio economic movement than being an anthropologist historian or radio host if you re from poor background you re probably less inclined to take risks when it comes to career choice versus passion the same holds true if your parents come from background or can remember what living poor was like most indians are only recently middle class even many upper middle class people do not come from old money and likely had parents who struggled financially while raising them so in place as obsessed with status as india the trend is to go after secure money in way that preserves social standing there is cultural and socio economic component mixed together know lot of eastern european migrants in the united states for them money and status are interchangeable so you see lot of russian and tatar guys who brag about how they have basically no education but earn as much as doctors with trucking businesses and taxi companies lot of them are pretty miserable though because they only live to make money indians do the same shit except don see all income as equal g guy who drives truck in the s and earns crore per year will be looked upon with disdain versus some programmer who makes lpm but indians have that same we were recently poor outlook that makes them scoff at any pursuit which isn money centric as worthless even if it is fulfilling based in passion and genuinely contributes to the well being of the country and community know many people who studied subjects like history sociology and and anthropology they were all very smart people who got into good phd programs overseas and are now earning more than the average engineer in india ever will but that path is riskier because an above average sociology student still has below average chance of getting into top ranked program furthermore people who go that route are basically required to get doctorate if they ever want any shot of earning sustainable salary in country where getting job right off campus is challenge engineering is offering that am not saying that all engineers get placed but its easier to get placed as an average engineer than as average xyz stream person it not field where you are earning lot or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful even after years when you become project manager you may earn lpa engineers start out at lpa for jobs that can be automated and they grow at rate of every year for basic skillset that is the right amount most of the jobs in the other fields also start out like this first of all you don make lpa in years unless you started out at lpa but if that is less for you wonder which world you re living in and what profession you imagine will pay more than this to mass of people don tell me startup or business because they require lot of fund to start and they re very risky very few startups and businesses make good money but still you re not like rich like you can do whatever you want you re still blind by office timing it not like you can take vacation whenever you want to this holds good for most of the other fields and you can do software engineering and get into freelancing which will give you this option not the case with many other fields hours in front of computer that on you if you feel its too much switch not all jobs are like this lot of jobs give you work from home options and flexible hours more now than ever with the startup culture kicking in you re expected to finish certain tasks and nobody is bothering you until the deadline in newer companies you re even allowed to pick what tasks you want to do from todo board set your own deadlines and work if that not freedom for you idk what is if technology changes and you don know that or do not learn the technology your career takes hit literally same for every profession if you re ca who doesn learn how to comply with gst your career takes hit if you re teacher who doesn learn how to teach today syllabus your career takes hit if you re an agriculturist who doesn employ modern methods your career takes hit but to be honest what you read on hackernews and shit where they say technology is dead and all is to be taken with pinch of salt the industry still has requirements for php who funeral is performed every day by people all over the internet so if someone learnt php in s and decided not to learn anything else doesn mean they re jobless today and years is enough time for you to progress into management so this is also not very valid reason simply because even if you are the th or th best engineer around you would still get paid if you are the th as business in your industry you will end up dead it is quite practical and that is why most indian parents push this on their children in india people decide what to do in life after they complete their engineering unknown behencho m now mad that never knew about job that would have gotten me lakhs per month after years one reason think is because it flexible you can do whatever you want with an engineering degree but with other degrees your options become limited cum again please to be frank this does not seem like bad option in india know this is not perfect life and maybe not what you wanted but that life not everyone can become highly successful person in photography acting singing etc at least with an it job you have an option to pursue your passion and relatively very less risky job with ample opportunities in india it is actually one of the best options out there it has been good career choice since s now it is on the decline but career trends take time to change got you pakoda bijness promotor lpa in years that too in average service it companies like tcs wipro infosys etc is that even possible when you start at lpa doubt you will reach in years in an average indian it company hmm too many people got butthurt from this post guess years when you become project manager you may earn lpa it may be due to lies dreams like that kind of like chasing achhe din as soon as get home will make write up about it basically every parents think engineering jobs are easy to get and this made the study it later to just realise it a shity one and the don have the courage to face kids kids whose time they wasted if you are unlucky to be born in family who doesn know what engineer does and have to do then you are fucked my parents still things electric engineering repairs bulbs and fixes wires passed from private engineering college and working under pwd contractor my parents wanted me to study and get government civil engineering job lol earn just k per month might sound low let me tell you the perks work site is just rs commute from home and get around per day for travel leave my home at am and get home around pm my work being managing field and bill work pwd office is min walking from home have zero to no expenditure would like to point out that while engineering jobs give good salary as per indian standards but on global level we have one of the lowest salary for an engineering job the reason for this is that companies come to india in search of cheap employees in my own experience have been in projects where worked with european engineers we did the same job but there was big pay gap now get that other countries have high living standards and hence the pay gap is justified but since the qualification and job is the same it highlights what indian engineers can earn by entrepreneurship or freelancing have followed what have written and have been job free for years now edit so would suggest to seriously consider entrepreneurship after engineering mainly because professions are not redirected in india take example pf pharmacy it is only here where you can get prescription drugs not only narcs but also antibiotics can be anywhere without any consequences also if you do get to work on your dream it is absolutely powerful love sci fi and am living it nothing else is as safe where do project managers earn lakhs if you go by societal norms you re failure if you re not engineer doctor entrepreneur government servant did miss any regardless fuck societal norms why india so many engineers even overseas but india infrastructure shit poor country means more things need to built and implemented so parents push kids to look at opportunities to build stuff rich country you can be an english major and still make kick ass money why is this post tagged as travel it the indian way doctors have such miserable workdays and compulsory deployment but it still promoted would want to be lakh not rich person over anything else 
trust yourself and do what you love it works out eventually my story  www reddit com india comments cepqe trust yourself and do what you love it works out i am rather poor guy who lost his father at the age of raised by mom who worked at private school opted for science after the board exams realized won even pass had to fight with family members to change it to commerce and passed with marks came to mumbai to study ca estimated around lakhs as fees expenses couldn afford that had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead learned computer engineering hardware networking for one year and got job at mnc worked in that field for years was just when joining this job didn complete my graduation around th year in my job realized had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems started learning more and more about it and build real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money but to really make something worthwhile had to dedicate more time used to live in virar and traveling to andheri mumbai every day for job took hrs hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didn want to work anymore so in around left my job and decided to move full time into internet marketing my wife her parents and my mom all thought have gone mad and pretty stupid and honestly that pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age for next months built websites around local businesses in uk ranked them and sold the leads to two companies the most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training the company paid per lead and made more than k per month around l in inr with it this boosted my confidence and invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing used to post my screenshots on facebook in random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet he looked confident and we meet at google conference later that week we discussed what we both has been doing he had lots of contacts at emerging companies and had the skills strategies and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns it was promising match and we end up forming company together we built digital agency the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue we quickly built team of about ninjas and went on to become very successful company in next years we worked with more than dozen listed companies fortune company and made lot of money for ourselves at materialistic levels just last year he bought very expensive car lakhs travelled to over countries and bought expensive home bhk powai cr we are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to at multiple times in my career had to fight with my own people go against the wind to make my way point of all this is you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public there is lot of people who are stuck at job they hate but can do shit about it either for family pressure or dozen different reasons for you strongly recommend that in your free time develop skill mostly in area you enjoy doing and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income once you are confident enough and have some numbers revenue to back it up take leap of faith and see where it takes don worry about failure if you fail getting job is the easiest thing to do agree that the being entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that parents ko bus paise chaiye as long as they see you are making good enough they will be fine sooner or later my father in law loves to flaunt when share my photos with bmw and mom makes dozens of calls telling all relatives whenever she purchase something expensive they just want to see you happy it

million story imo good story and really awesome how you never gave up buuut here the thing this is just one story out of millions good bo burnham quote about this would say don take advice from people

us hope to fight back irrespective of current situation deleted needed this today thank you for sharing thank you for sharing this and know exactly what you re taking about but sometimes it a lot harder than you just made it out to be ve been really lucky too worked for bit and realised hated what was doing and after lot of trial and error decided to do something of my own too started something with my partner video production house and worked really hard at it at first it was just the of us doing everything and we worked our asses off we did what we think its good work gave it our all and put in all the effort we could to give our clients the best deal possible each and every single time even if it meant we made less profit we continued and slowly our team began to grow years later and after lot of struggle we now have team of we ve done some great work and brought our clients really good value for money even after putting in so much hard work effort and our hearts and should in to it sometimes it feels like you don get appreciated for what you do at all month ago we nearly got cheated out of very large sum of money for us and all because the people we were working with had huge ego issues we ve managed to get out most of the money but have still lost pretty big amount this kind of stuff is really demoralising especially when you work really hard give it your all put in everything you ve got and do good job we re trying really hard to carry on and continue doing good work but it so hard to stay positive sometimes thank you for sharing your success story and letting us know that good things definitely do happen m going to keep at it and hope for the best thanks lot for this post this is very encouraging this is amazing would love to pick your brain some time this is real inspiration thank you op thanks for sharing this amazing story of your life very inspiring for making your interest your side hustle to see if it can generate revenue in the first place damn wish to post something like this someday good one what type of websites did you build around local uk businesses am learning it too but dont have chance to test and practise these skills great post thank you for sharing slice of your journey love to draw and edit pictures on my phone after drawing it also have developed an interest in digital marketing where do you reckon start have been doing job for the past years which dont quite like but gotta do something for gandhi thank you for reading yup thanks but still can figure out my future inspiring and real belief and hustle will get people far you have also bought the internet down to people who do not know how to use them the example of the heavy transport driving training the problem with most techies myself included is that we stay in the computer space its fair money but the real money is integrating with the business world not just money but independence congrats on well executed life and career great post but how did you contact uk locals what was the overall approach can you explain that in detail how did you get the exposure cool story it is good to hear success stories thank you so much man just today was thinking what would do after graduate average marks and the fucked up field of mechanical engineering won take me anywhere was thinking reading this gave me confidence that building skills and struggling will take me somewhere surely what wonderful story man kudos on your hardwork as was reading this had thought that just pissed me off thing just how many would have said ahh made it there by luck r one lucky guy but know it not much of luck than being passionate and working hard as startup what problems did you face with respect to setting up company paying taxes etc was that an easy process op can follow you on twitter dm your twitter id if you like the idea this is an amazing story ve always wanted to try new stuff but most of the time my interests were never related to my job which is why never went ahead can you elaborate on exactly what skills you learnt regarding during the period you wanted to building things on the internet since it wasn related to hardware networking also didn understand what you actually did with building websites around local businesses in uk and ranking them excuse my ignorance guess success is the mixture of developing skill appropriate for the times and just putting yourself out there to find like minded people who can complement your skills to achieve business success hopefully your success story continues and even though many have failed where you succeeded they can take some inspiration this question is for everybody what are the new skills to be learnt as of today in any field you re aware of which might have huge impact in future like those related to digital marketing in and by op feeling good for you op hope my life has turnaround as such one day till then slogging and learning it is deleted don worry about failure if you fail getting job is the easiest thing to do xb trust me this is hard for me thanks for sharing your story sir awesome share inspired to do more deliver more really motivating post will try to grab of this that is so cool m year old internet marketer myself got into it during the th grade just before boards and started by building sites for people and so on but it was mostly on off years ago quit college to do im fulltime and have made over k online since doing commerce mostly have lot of plans for the future and reading your story just inspires me to go harder at it good luck with your future endeavors man to all the skeptics saying that no one talks about failure how wrong pickup any successful person biography it will be an account of their failures and how they persevered regardless the biggest takeaway from op advice is use your free time to develop your skills and then use those skills to break the cycle being an entrepreneur is not the only option you could learn investing and find ways to generate passive income start by reading some warren buffet some anthony robbins you rock boss that the right kinda motivation bc iit iim mnc happy life ka funda hi chutiya hai paisa banao khush raho thanks man just started working last year don know if have the necessary skills to make it big where do start what do learn also what exactly do you mean by digital marketing what kind of stuff can focus on to make money can get job saar am useless as of now floydian

an appeal please do not jail pubg users  www reddit com india comments byd an appeal please do not jail pubg users we cannot believe we are writing this as per media reports which surfaced yesterday the rajkot police department has arrested youths for playing the pubg online video game clearly things have spiralled out of control contested public debate pubg entered the mainstream lexicon in

issues notice to ban students from playing pubg or any other addictive game that the game was addictive and could cause negative impacts on children even beyond their academic performance it is important to take step back this moment and consider the wider academic literature on the subject the top three cited meta studies on google scholar on the general impact of gaming on adolescents indicate varying outcomes some even suggest benefits such as development and improvement of hand eye remember the old atari preview redd it nfpahfm png width format png auto webp ffcafcabeedeaeabada yes we may be completely wrong in an our inferences but believe that this may be matter for parental caution and social debate but certainly not penal law we explain the dangerous consequences of approaching this as legal issue below prohibitory order on playing pubg the rajkot police commissioner has issued prohibitory order under section of the code of criminal procedure on march section order under the criminal procedure code is usually made to prevent illegal physical assemblies breach of peace while large numbers of online gamers do congregate and spend long hours in front of their smartphones or gaming consoles much to the annoyance of their friends and family such assemblies are rarely unlawful it would be stretch to call such activities as threatening public order hence we

the help offered by manan bhatt from reading the prohibitory order it is reasonable to infer that as per press reports youths ranging from the ages of to have been arrested for the breach of this prohibitory order at this point we found ourselves bewildered and taken aback as this is seemingly grave attack on personal liberty we believe as the hon ble prime minister noted in his conversation that concerns on online gaming are better handled with the care and affection of parent and teachers certainly not by creating fear of penal law through prohibitory orders issued by the police and subsequent arrests this is not only abhorrent to sensibility but offends our core fundamental rights as it lacks rationality and the reasonableness necessary in any restriction imposed by the state in the coming days we will be sourcing and authenticating information and taking steps including talking to legal team based out of gujarat we hope to address this issue responsibly and meanwhile urge

wouldnt be surprised if saw ban on gaming consoles or smartphones one of the days it really sucks lmao anyways you ain stopping none the people who want to access porn sites are still gonna access em the people who wanna access reddit will access reddit par modiji ne toh pubji par joke mara tha aur log ulluyon ki tarah hase bhi the if you dont want your child to play pubg just take their phone away no one elee is messing with your kid only you re responsible don blame others for your kid fault parents forget russian scientists who had to use quantum computers to reverse time we fucking managed to go back in time without them they should ban tv movies as well since they re highly addictive as medium too and not to forget filled with violence seriously don get this mentality games are form of entertainment just as movies and shows are then why are they specifically targeting us gamers with the sudden popularity of pubg it not like we didn have cod or counter strike before matlab bade bade criminal rape karke aur desh ke paise loot ke bhaag rahe hai idhar udhar lekin mai kya karega mai jake pubg khelne wale ko jail me dalega because fuck democracy that why censorship all over arresting for games blocking reddit what are we upto it not far away that we will have access to only few sites apps that support the ruling party agendas back then we had pc games where we rode bikes kicked cops consumed mushrooms killed turtles drove cars simply ran over pedestrians wonder how any of these would have survived in today times maybe if they release patch with winner winner goumutra dinner slogan this shit won happen wish india focused on it development rather than less important matters like mandir and banning apps and changing names of places people will be jailed for playing games but the real culprit will go abroad jai hind pubg user should show power of game and start playing in real life by starting fill the jail movement once police and court become so overwhelmed by all these paperwork than they realise what they are asking for these idiotas will make any and every incomprehensible and idiotic law as long as it meets the demand of their vote bank what waste of life there were cases of murder and theft reported on account of this video game the police just took the easy way out to olve the problem there should be better way of educating the people about the ill effects of playing this game instead of blanket ban imo 
 rant m seriously tired of this is so called education www reddit com india comments ctzkd rant im seriously tired of this is so called this is mostly your weekly education rant nothing new throwaway account since d like to stay anonymous and wanted to let my thoughts out in the open bit about me first loved computers from pretty young age but at the time simply loved it as hobby also remember the young me reading tons of books on topics like space and nature the only thing was good at my middle school was physics and computer science but kinda ignored all the other subjects also loved helping other students with these subjects to the extent teachers would point out to me with stop being so noisy and get back to your seat kind of synonyms was pretty open to the future wondering what it held for me anyway decided to pick up engineering everything has been going in downward spiral since then as any typical kid in india trying to get into good engineering college went to these so called jee coaching classes these places were so horrible over time realised that these coaching classes are simply forcing down material onto their students if there was some actual learning happening in there given the vast syllabus it wouldn be so surprising whenever high school kid from india marked an innovation in science rather we see students killing themselves for not being able to score good marks in the examination there is such an intense pressure on kids since you re constantly being told that not making into good college equates to no woman marrying you and you re going to be working an awful job if not jobless in short your life is going to become so fucked up that we see kids already making peace with death instead and then out there are some fucking assholes who feel that this is helping in reducing the population of our country by weeding out the unworthy just stop making kids at the rate you shit fuckheads instead of making positive effect in the country these coaching centres asking for shitload of money are simply saturating the already saturated field of engineering in india some parents also force their kids to these coaching centres just because of their faculty flaunting their achievements as if they are god gift to this world anyway these coaching centres are just symptom of the core problem of how most reputed colleges in india accept students solely on the basis of one or two examinations and how colleges like to be seduced into being an aicte approved college this whole education thing has turned into fucking business failed my jee since couldn keep up the failure doesn hurt me partially because it is my way of rejecting this system ve come to realisation that cannot learn things solely by books and paper need to experience it in reality or cannot digest anything which is why was probably good in and loved physics and computer science it costs virtually nothing to see things in motion and see that the equations really do match up and write computer programs to do stuff for you and everything makes sense the thing is that doing everything in such way consumes lot of time but feel it is worth it it extremely hard to work on all the high school concepts here and look out for their real world significance at the same time all when the examinations are pretty much all formulae and rote based anyway joined tier college hoping to at least make it nice in computer science since all you need is computer to experience anything but oh lord fuck this place just so you know spent my high school years learning to program by writing small scripts to manipulate my environment and eventually started working with other people to make open source software so all this helped me get into gsoc in my very first year of college and worked with some genuine people working hard to make positive impact to this world if not for gsoc d also have been forced to attend the summer training to learn html css along with other students in the college itself where the students are kept idle for like half the session and you know what all restrictions they put on even when you are idle no phones no youtube no heads down for taking break no talking to other students seriously had another friend of mine who did gsoc in the nd year but you know what students were supposed to attend training institute by paying the institute money during this summer break but apparently his gsoc wasn considered since it was seen as an online course as opposed to going and attending training institute by our head of department so rejected poor guy still had to pay private institute for his forged training certificate despite of working so hard and lie that he worked on both his training and his gsoc project ll talk about some more wonders here our college has so called soft skills sessions where instead of learning how to communicate properly with other people you are simply taught how to flaunt and bluff every little thing to everyone and speak hollow words to impress other people since in the end this college only cares about to headline the highest number of placements offered in the limca book of records rather than receiving proper technical knowledge we spend time practising aptitude questions many students here have difficulty communicating structuring grammar and forming sentences in simple english due to their unfortunate backgrounds and yet no work is ever done to help those students become proficient it been semesters since we ve been studying about software engineering and software testing to learn the craft of creating and maintain software and literally not single fucking line of code yet most students still believe all that there is to testing software is looking for bugs by hand there hasn even been mention of automated tests and sort till date and am years in and if the authorities find any students good in solving aptitude questions they are going to differentiate them by making them solve codechef problems in extra classes as if remaining students are merely possession to the college for the time we are assigned to work on team project every semester and are evaluated by professors who have no experience in the said technology the project is based on these professors then end up judging students by asking standardised definitions from the desired technology in the final viva instead of actually evaluating by asking project specific questions no wonder the majority of students steal from github or copy paste projects from their peers no one cares also the assignment questions are so blunt with hardly any thinking involved you can look them up and boom you get full marks if you submitted it on time now could keep listing whatever the hell is wrong here minimum attendance or no exams for you students are forced to stay seated and their heads up even if the concerned subject teacher is on leave and the substitute teacher has nothing to teach about internet wifi is censored by some company called fortiguard anyway the internet hardly works here can eat roam or leave the campus before noon worst of all there are students who have been so brainwashed that they blindly trust the authorities just because they believe the faculty is truly full of professionals and are the ones who can help them get job if they keep repeating their words we aren really learning anything here of actual use don even know whether this is the situation for most colleges in india or just happen to be in one now here is me who helps with some really nice open source projects writes technical posts trying my best not to repeat what the internet already knows fighting censorship trying to help my peers and random internet people with anything technical whenever possible just because like to care about people all this when college eats up my hours including commute everyday really feel like fucking idiot now what am even doing don even want to bother with money or be rich man just enough to feed myself or if family happens someday this shit has been so sickening lately that ve started doubting that it just me who the real asshole here is  oh man my story is like similar to yours at least you had some group projects and stuff all had to go through was countless hours of theory just to pass the exams from the professor who didn knew shit what they were even talking about just didn give shit anymore stopped eating properly stopped going out stop exercising started to loose interest in everything did even the things used to like programming no wonder dropped out of engineering agree dude the whole system is ass here went abroad for all my education even after cracked jee because knew would be able to actually grow as person out there college should help people mature and grow instead of just forcing an education they don treat you like an adult or give you any freedoms here remember my first day in dorm and asked the ras if there are any restrictions on what time can be out and they were like you can go out wherever you want if you go talk to an advisor about your interest or careers they genuinely talk about it and help you find classes clubs minors or even help switch your major they treat you like an adult and let you make your own choices everywhere else over here it all about cramming information into you and getting you shitty job hi mate pretty much agree with most of what you said although can help you much but can certainly offer you some advice about gsoc and getting coding job on your own life is really long and if you really love coding there is very little that can stop from getting great job after you are free from the university ping me if you want some advice are you from srm by any chance youtu be xqcg hlvd very honest rant frankly after seeing the inefficient working of colleges it better to enroll with distance learning course which provides legit degree like ignou lot cheaper saves lot of time for learning and you are getting your degree anyway which makes everyone eligible to sit in whatever they want 
confused with my career www reddit com india comments dlgr confused with my career hi m year old man living in india did my bachelor of technology in computer science was fine in programming and was noob in competitive programming somehow cracked the tcs codevita competitive programming competition and got job in tcs but m not very much satisfied with my job the college studied in was tier three college so good companies don visit our campus had offers from tcs wipro etc but tcs was the best in all the worst companies had offers from so joined it the salary get is also very low lpa also have service agreement of an year there m very much confused about my future as to what should do next don want to work there need good salary so should get better at competitive programming and let companies contact me or should get decent in ds algos give elitmus and let companies contact me or should give the gate exam and do tech or should go to us and do my masters or should give cat and go for mba also my girlfriend is doing her master from well reputed college so have an inferiority complex she ll also be doing phd me being b tech feel very bad about myself someone please guide me m already depressed  take gate only if you are interested in studying if you are looking for better job practice and appear for coding interviews never be discouraged by the achievements of your gf spouse they need your encouragement not jealousy also please don be depressed most engineers start their career at tcs and the like build up from here at worst you are on the same path as most engineering grads you need to pass years in tcs it will be difficult but doable you need the experience number believe me tcs experience holds good value in the market meanwhile pick technology that you like and learn it thoroughly in your personal time tcs provides plenty of premium learning resources try to do projects on that then start giving interviews on the tech that you learnt tcs does not mention the platform you worked on in the company on their experience letter so you can lie on your resume you might have to give multiple interviews before you get selected but every setback helps to be better also interview everywhere even in companies that you have never heard of also it is better to learn technology where there are less people on that skill set available in the market that is great advantage as it is easier to get good job with knowledge of say big data when compared to java started as mainframe developer in tcs after passing from tier college was pushed into this garbage technology without providing any options now work at multinational bank as react developer and there are people passed out from iits nits bits etc who report to me
